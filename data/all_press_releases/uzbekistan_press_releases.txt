Title: Central Asian States reaffirm commitment to registering all children at birth
Content: 17 May 2024
Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan accelerate efforts to end statelessness.
Representatives from the Governments of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, gathered in Tashkent today, reaffirming their commitment to ensuring every child born on their territories are registered at birth.
The ‘Central Asian Conference on Ensuring Birth Registration to Prevent Statelessness’ was convened by UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee agency, in collaboration with the National Human Rights Centre of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
Statelessness, the situation of not being recognized as a citizen by any country, affects millions of people around the world, and over 37,000 people in Central Asia alone. Without a nationality, stateless people often cannot access the most basic of rights, including education, employment, healthcare, and freedom of movement.
Birth registration is a critical first step in securing legal identity, and enabling individuals to contribute to society, by paying taxes, and health and social care levies, and the sustainable development of their communities.
“We are proud to host this conference today and share with participants the successful efforts undertaken by the Republic of Uzbekistan to end statelessness,” said Akmal Saidov, First Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan and Director of the National Centre for Human Rights. “In 2018, Uzbekistan amended legislation ensuring all children born on our territory are registered at birth, and in the last five years alone we have reduced the number of stateless people by over 75 percent.”
Conference participants represented national administrations responsible for managing birth registration, or involved with the process, including Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Ministries of Interior, Ministries of Justice, and National Human Rights Institutions, as well as international organizations.
Six key topics were explored through the day, including: Establishing universal birth registration systems and integrating them with education, health and social services; Leveraging technology for efficient birth registration; Best practices in universal birth registration in the region; and Protecting the rights of stateless children and children of unknown parents.
“Ensuring legal identify for all, including birth registration, is enshrined in the 2023 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and committed to by all countries of Central Asia as the UN Member States,” said Ashita Mittal, Acting UN Coordinator in Uzbekistan. “We commend the significant achievements of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in their efforts to reduce and eradicate statelessness. The UN stands ready to support states to ensure forcibly displaced and stateless people are not left behind, but can contribute to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.”
In 2014, UNHCR launched the global #IBelong Campaign to End Statelessness. With 2024 marking the end of the 10-year campaign, States across the world are accelerating efforts to reduce and end statelessness.
Statelessness in Central Asia largely resulted from the dissolution of the Soviet Union. While many residents were able to confirm or acquire the nationality of the independent States, some still remain in legal limbo. As of January 2024, there are 37,819 known stateless people in Central Asia.
To date, 98 States have acceded the 1954 Convention, and 80 States to the 1961 Convention, including six CIS countries. Turkmenistan is the only Central Asian State that has acceded the two UN Statelessness Conventions.

Title: Role of Media and Journalists in Promoting and Protecting Citizens' Environmental Rights
Content: 15 May 2024
A roundtable to be held in Tashkent to mark the 31st World Press Freedom Day. This year's celebration highlights the importance of journalism and freedom of expression in the context of the current global environmental crisis. The press, journalism, access to information and its dissemination play a crucial role in ensuring a sustainable future in which people's rights and diversity of their opinions are respected.
Sustainable development is under threat. The triple planetary crisis - climate change, biodiversity loss and air pollution - along with their interconnection with public health problems, the need to strengthen democracy, combat the spread of disinformation on digital platforms, among other problems, has become a serious problem for humanity. The information ecosystem is called upon to play a key role in overcoming this existential crisis. Access to reliable information and the importance of strengthening independent environmental and scientific journalism are more important than ever. Independent journalists, as well as scientists, play a crucial role in helping our society separate fact from fiction and manipulation and make informed decisions, including on environmental policy.
Article 49 of the new Constitution of Uzbekistan, adopted in July 2023, enshrines the constitutional right of every citizen to a favorable environment and reliable information about its state. The Constitution also obliges the state to take all necessary measures to improve, restore and protect the ecological system. Article 61 of the Constitution also obliges every citizen to protect the environment. The transition to a "green" economy and environmental protection are declared a priority of the government.
The roundtable will provide a platform for exchanging views on the following questions:
The roundtable organized jointly by the Regional Office of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for Central Asia, the National Center of the Republic of Uzbekistan for Human Rights and UNESCO within the framework of the AIM Accountability Information Media programme, funded by SDC and the UNESCO Multi-Donor Program ("MDP") on freedom of expression and safety of journalists. The Action Plan on Freedom of Expression and Safety of Journalists is aimed at further strengthening UNESCO's work at the global, regional and national levels by directing funds to new priorities and meeting the most pressing needs to fulfill its mandate in the field of freedom of expression, media development and media and information literacy.

Title: OHCHR organized the series of events on the 4th cycle Outcomes of the UPR of Uzbekistan
Content: 26 April 2024
On 26 April 2024, the UN Human Rights Office in Central Asia (OHCHR) jointly with the National Human Rights Centre of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the international non-governmental organization UPR.INFO concluded the series of events dedicated to the outcomes of the Fourth cycle of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Uzbekistan.
During the week, the OHCHR carried out an introductory session on the UPR and the role of the Parliament for the deputies of the Legislative Chamber and the members of the Senate of the Oliy Majlis of Uzbekistan; two workshops on the development of actions plans for the implementation of the UPR recommendations for civil society organizations and the Ombudsperson Institution and a workshop on the development of indicators to measure the implementation of recommendations for the representatives of state bodies and academia.
“The workshop for civil society was very useful. We were able not only to learn about the UPR recommendations but create partnership with other civil society activists in order to promote their implementation. I have already got some ideas on how to unite efforts with peer colleagues, the government, state bodies, the National Human Rights Centre and others in order to implement the recommendations aimed at eradicating torture in my country” stated Ms. Elena Urlaeva, Leader of the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan.
Mr. Nariman Umarov, Chairperson of the Committee for Combatting Corruption and Judicial-Legal Issues of the Parliament’s Senate,  emphasized the role of the Parliament in the UPR process and stressed the importance of cooperation: “We deeply understand the significance of the participation and role of the Parliament in these processes, and we express our readiness to collaborate with the National Human Rights Center, OHCHR and UPR.INFO to develop National Action Plan and to implement the recommendations”.
Earlier, on 4 April 2024, the OHCHR ROCA in cooperation with the National Human Rights Centre   and the UPR.INFO carried out a briefing on the outcomes of the UPR Fourth cycle. The event was attended by MPs, the NHRI, representatives of state bodies, judges, academia, CSOs and mass media. OHCHR called all stakeholders to unite efforts in the development of a National Action Plan for the implementation of UPR recommendations.
Republic of Uzbekistan went through the Universal Periodic Review in November 2023, while the final text of the recommendations was adopted on 22 March 2024. Out of 234 received recommendations, Uzbekistan accepted 219 and took note of 15.

Title: Bus drivers learn how to advance the rights of persons with disabilities
Content: 18 April 2024
On 19 April 2024, the UN Human Rights Office in Central Asia (OHCHR) in cooperation with the National Human Rights Center (NHRC) and the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Uzbekistan held a briefing for bus drivers on the rights of persons with disabilities.
More than 50 bus drivers and conductors participated in the discussion dedicated to the role of bus drivers in advancing the rights of persons with disabilities that took place in Tashkent bus depot # 8.
Prof. Akmal Saidov, the Director of the NHRC, reminded that Uzbekistan ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2021 and submitted its first report to the respective UN Committee in 2023. He called upon the audience to use a human-rights based approach to disability rather than treating persons with disability with charity sentiments. “It is important to introduce effective mechanisms for inclusive development, to ensure that all layers of the population have equal rights and opportunities, and to create the necessary conditions for the participation of persons with disabilities in all spheres of public life”, he added.

Pavlo Byalyk, OHCHR Human Rights Officer, outlined the link between public transportation and realization of human rights. He noted that full realization of the rights of persons with disabilities does not depend solely on state officials from ministries and state agencies. “You as bus drivers can help persons with disabilities realize their rights to education, employment, health and many others by bringing them to school, workplace and hospital on time and demonstrating supportive and respectful attitude and actions”.
Madina Polatova and Nargiza Kodirova, both persons in wheelchairs, came to participate in the briefing in line with the principle “Nothing for us, without us”.
They made a presentation and led a practical part of the briefing by demonstrating the issues they experience when travelling by bus.
Madina, who is also a graduate of the OHCHR human rights and advocacy school for youth with disabilities, remarked that “Most modern buses have ramps but sometimes bus drivers do not lower them for me to enter the bus. This makes me miss my appointment or meeting and leaves me with a very unpleasant feeling of being ignored and neglected”.
Mr Ilhomjon Abdugafarov, Deputy Minister of Transportation noted the importance of this initiative and the need to integrate a component on the rights of persons with disabilities into regular pre-service and in-service training.
Similar briefings should take place for other cohorts of bus drivers later this year.

Title: Investing in girls’ education and skills is foundational to strengthening economies
Content: 07 March 2024


On International Women’s Day, UNICEF has called for investment in girl’s education, empowerment and providing equal employment opportunities for young women   including for those with disabilities, as foundational and imperative for Uzbekistan’s prosperity.
This year’s theme “Invest in women: Accelerate progress” recognizes that tangible investment in girls and women are often catalytic, sparking positive change across all levels of society and leading to strengthened economies.
Globally, simple measures such as bursaries for girls and young women have proven transformational to both local and national economies.  Further, research has shown that enhanced social protection for girls from low-income families and support in receiving concessionary loans on higher education for women is key and in the medium term contributes to more stable, resilient societies.
Uzbekistan has achieved a lot for girls and women through increased women’s political participation, access to higher education, initiatives promoting women’s empowerment and economic participation, progressive legislation strengthening women's rights. However, much remains to be done in terms of tangible investments, funded and costed initiatives that create equal opportunities,  enforce existing laws that protect women's rights, addressing negative gender stereotypes, empowering women in leadership roles and increasing access to quality healthcare and essential services for women.
Recent evidence demonstrates that the share of women in engineering, manufacturing, construction, and ICT programmes is a mere 17%.  Meanwhile the share of women and men working in STEM fields, specifically researchers in natural sciences, engineering and technology, medical and health sciences, agriculture and veterinary sciences is 37%.[1]
“In UNICEF we know that deliberate or even affirmative investments towards girls and young women are foundational for building stronger societies and economies,” said Geoffrey Ijumba,  UNICEF’s Acting Representative in Uzbekistan” Here in Uzbekistan our advocacy and programme in the area of ensuring girls are in STEM is  beginning to yield results  and these are results that will be felt by the  country for  a  long time.”
While there are huge efforts by government to empower girls and women, for instance through providing equal opportunities in primary and secondary education and recent legislative amendments to criminalize domestic violence, harmful social norms, structures and stereotypes that perpetuate inequality still persist and influence the division of labour, priorities and focus at home, in education, at the workplace and in society. Furthermore, women and girls bear the brunt of unpaid care work within families.
Therefore, UNICEF calls on the following key tenets and investments:

Title: GEF allocates USD 26 million to environmental projects in Central Asia
Content: 01 March 2024
The Europe and Central Asia region has a wide variety of topography and climates and is vulnerable to climate change. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been partnering with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for over two decades to support countries in sustainably managing natural resources and preserving biodiversity in a changing climate and to ensure food security and nutrition while reversing environmental degradation and its impacts.
A milestone in this cooperation was reached on the margins of the Fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP14), held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan when high-level representatives from both organizations agreed on continued strong collaboration between FAO and GEF.
Within the framework of the Sixty-sixth meeting of the GEF Council that took place in Washington D. C. (USA) in early February this year, USD 26 million was allocated to finance five projects of the Regional Programme “Interconnection of Water and Land Resources of Central Asia (CAWLN) for Ecosystem Restoration, Improved Management of Natural Resources, and Increased Sustainability.” Four of these five projects, valued at USD 18.6 million, will be implemented in Uzbekistan with FAO assistance.
“The funds pledged by GEF to these environmental projects in Central Asia will enable FAO, in cooperation with the Government of Uzbekistan, to do significant work to increase local resiliency and food security, conserve and protect ecosystems and biodiversity, and strengthen sustainable agri-food systems,” said Viorel Gutu, Assistant FAO Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia. “In natural-resource dependent rural communities, these projects will have a positive impact on the environment that supports the livelihoods of these rural peoples for many years to come,” he added.
The joint efforts will target land restoration in vulnerable ecosystems of Central Asia, strengthening integrated water resources management in the basins of the Amudarya, Zarafshan, Panj, Syrdarya, and Narin rivers and integrated natural resource management to improve the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity conservation.
“The new projects will introduce innovative approaches for sustainable agricultural production and mitigation of climate change's negative impacts on agri-food systems. With the close cooperation with the Ministry of Ecology, Environmental Protection and Climate Change, we will achieve great success,” emphasized Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan.
CMS COP is a significant international meeting where governments, scientists and stakeholders come together to agree on strategies for the conservation of migratory species and their habitats. During the  high-level plenary session, "Nature Knows No Borders: Working Together for Migratory Species and Sustainable Development in Central Asia," FAO, the Ministry of Ecology, Environmental Protection and Climate Change of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) signed a Letter of Intent, committing their organizations  to continue to cooperate and expedite the preparation of a Letter of Agreement for their joint implementation of the “Food systems, land use and restoration impact programme in Uzbekistan”. Funded by GEF, the project will introduce efficient land management technologies and conservation approaches in wheat-dominated production landscapes, and the methodologies to create environmentally friendly value chains that will help to realize the transition from ecosystem degradation to sustainable management in the Karakalpakstan, Kashkadarya and Khorezm regions.
As part of CMS COP14, a side event was dedicated to sustainable development initiatives, raising public awareness around and participation in the environmental protection process. Participants heard an overview of the National Report on the State of the Environment in the Republic of Uzbekistan, which is intended to be a tool for the creation and implementation of improved environmental and socio-economic policy instruments, legal frameworks, and effective mechanisms for state regulation of nature management and environmental protection. FAO experts presented the Sustainable Wildlife Management Programme and Legal Hub, a free online gateway to the world of sustainable wildlife management-related law. Through this platform users can discover all the tools and methodologies hat are used for assessing national legislation across countries with the support of national lawyers.
These five GEF-funded projects are expected to be a driver of positive change. The projects will protect and restore ecosystems and promote their sustainable use, combat climate change and help transform regional food systems into more equitable and environmentally sustainable agri-food systems.

Title: New guideline on preventing food loss and waste was presented in Samarkand
Content: 14 February 2024
As part of CMS COP-14, a side event was held in Samarkand, dedicated to sustainable development initiatives, raising public awareness and participation in the environmental protection process. It was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Ecology, Environmental Protection and Climate Change of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). During the event, new joint publications have been presented.
One of them is Uzbek translation of the FAO brochure “Your guide to living free of food waste” prepared in cooperation with the Ministry of Ecology, Environmental Protection and Climate Change of the Republic of Uzbekistan and Zamin Foundation. It was noted that food loss and waste is a global problem. At least 17 percent of all food produced worldwide is wasted each year, from retail stores to households. That is 931 million tonnes of food, which could feed millions of people who are going hungry each day.
"Global agrifood systems account for 31 percent of total anthropogenic emissions. Biodiversity loss continues to accelerate across the world and today more than ever before in human history about one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction. FAO’s estimates reported in 2022 set the Global Food Loss Percentage at 13.3 percent. And on average, each of us produces 74 kg of food waste each year. Educating public on social and environmental issues such as food loss and waste is very important and we are pleased to partner with the Ministry of Ecology, Environmental Protection and Climate Change of the Republic of Uzbekistan and Zamin Foundation in this area. Our so-called practical guide for consumers provides easily implementing tips and recommendations for preventing and reducing food loss and waste in households. These simple actions require minimum efforts and enable everyone to contribute into positive changes", - Viorel Gutu, Assistant FAO Director General stressed.
Another publication presented during the side-event is the National Report on the State of the Environment in the Republic of Uzbekistan, prepared by the Ministry of Ecology, Environmental Protection and Climate Change of the Republic of Uzbekistan,  FAO, UNECE, UNEP and other organizations. It is an analytical document that contains an assessment of the environmental situation and an analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships that cause changes. The report will help Uzbekistan to make environmentally sound decisions and to improve environmental and socio-economic policy, the legal framework, mechanisms for state regulation of nature management and environmental protection.
Uzbekistan, like most of Central Asia, is prone to natural hazards like dust storms, mudslides, earthquakes. Many of these are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, with significant environmental, health and social impacts – especially for women, children and older persons. The preparation of the National State of the Environment Report was an important step towards a sustainable future, as it is an investment in disaster risk prevention and reduction in the country.
The methodology of the report was based on the UNECE Guidelines for the preparation of governmental reports on the state and protection of the environment. The project team of the “Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration Impact Program in Uzbekistan” supported development of the report.

Title: Major UN Meeting on Migratory Species Conservation Opens in Uzbekistan
Content: 12 February 2024
14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals Opens under the slogan, "Nature Knows No Borders.”
The 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP14) to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) opened today in the historic Silk Road city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan. This pivotal UN wildlife meeting brings together CMS Parties and other governments, UN organizations engaged in biodiversity conservation, scientific experts, wildlife conservation organizations and many other stakeholders from around the globe. The meeting will consider progress in implementing the Convention, as well as actions for addressing the many conservation needs and challenges for migratory species and their habitats. During the week-long negotiations, CMS COP14 is expected to consider an extensive agenda covering more than a hundred items, including:
The first-ever State of the World’s Migratory Species report will also be launched on the opening day of COP14, helping to provide a scientific foundation for the discussions at the meeting.
This UN wildlife conservation conference is one of the most significant global biodiversity gatherings since the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). CMS has a major role to play in achieving the implementation of the GBF.
Amy Fraenkel, CMS Executive Secretary, said:
“We are at a critical juncture for the future of migratory species as we open COP14 in Samarkand. This meeting, taking place for the first time in Central Asia along the historic Silk Road, emphasizes the importance of transboundary cooperation by bringing together governments and a global community committed to migratory species conservation. Our agenda is ambitious, reflecting the urgent need for action highlighted by the 'State of the World’s Migratory Species' report. As we face challenges of habitat loss and species decline, COP14 provides a critical opportunity to advance conservation efforts and directly contribute to the achievement of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework."
Billions of animals make migratory journeys each year on land, in the oceans, and in the skies, crossing national boundaries and continents, with some traveling thousands of miles across the globe to feed and breed. They are an integral part of well-functioning   ecosystems and provide many benefits to people, including as a source of food, economic benefits such as   from tourism, and services and functions such as pollinating plants, transporting key nutrients, preying on pests, and helping to store carbon.
But migratory species are facing increasing threats. The landmark CMS report “State of the World’s Migratory Species,” to be released later today, reveals a shocking decline with many of the world’s migratory species of animals declining and the risk of global extinction increasing. Featuring analysis of over 4,000 species, including 1,189 that have been recognized by CMS Parties as needing international action, the report issues a clear wake-up call and provides a set of priority recommendations for action to the COP.
The conference opens under the slogan, "Nature Knows No Borders," which is a reminder that the journeys of migratory species do not adhere to political boundaries, and that their survival is dependent on international collaboration, including transboundary, regional and global conservation efforts.
This CMS meeting is the first COP of any global environmental treaty to take place in Central Asia, a region that is home to many migratory species including the Saiga Antelope, the Snow Leopard, and many species of migratory birds.
Along with the launch of the State of the World’s Migratory Species report, the COP will consider other scientific reports, including new CMS reports on Climate Change and Migratory Species, Wildlife Disease and Health, and Insect Decline.
Delegates are also expected to discuss new and strengthened mandates on addressing the illegal and unsustainable taking of species, programs on Flyways, Cetaceans, and priority actions on the impacts of climate change on migratory species.
The COP’s opening was preceded by a High-level Segment (HLS), convened on 11 February, under the theme “Working together for migratory species and sustainable development in Central Asia.” Sessions 1 and 2 of the meeting featured special dialogues among Ministers, Executives of International Organizations, and other high-level representatives with a focus on strengthening transboundary cooperation for the conservation of migratory species in Central Asia. The last session invited ministers and other high-level officials to share their experiences related to international or transboundary cooperation on migratory species conservation.
The slogan of COP14 reflects the core of the CMS mandate and builds on the historic resolution of the UN General Assembly in 2021: "Nature knows no borders: transboundary cooperation – a key factor for biodiversity conservation, restoration, and sustainable use" (A/75/L.73). The proposal, led by countries from Central Asia, urged all UN Member States to increase international and transboundary cooperation to maintain and enhance the ecological connectivity of transboundary habitats, cross-border protected areas, and ecosystems that are either vulnerable or form part of the migratory range of specific species.
The logo of the conference features a snow leopard, which is a keystone species in Uzbekistan, with a range that extends across 12 countries. While the big cat is a sacred symbol of power and benevolence, its conservation status is of great concern, with only 2,700 to 3,300 individuals thought to exist in the wild (Source: IUCN Red List of Threatened Species).
Despite the grim outlook of species decline and increasing pressures on their habitats from human activities, there are also many cases of hopeful recoveries thanks to coordinated conservation efforts under CMS. A notable example from Central Asia is the highly successful integrated conservation and restoration efforts in Kazakhstan, which have brought the Saiga Antelope back from the brink of extinction.
The event schedule includes the Migratory Species Champion Night, set for the evening of 12 February, promises to be a memorable occasion, celebrating sustained commitments by CMS Parties towards the conservation of the planet’s migratory wildlife.
The negotiations of the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) will be held during plenary and working group sessions throughout the week of 12-17 February, with final deliberations and the adoption of a set of new resolutions and decisions on Saturday, 17 February 2024.

Title: UN supports consultations of Uzbekistan authorities with civil society on human rights recommendations
Content: 02 February 2024
On 2 February 2024, the UN Human Rights Office in Central Asia (OHCHR) in cooperation with the National Human Rights Center (NHRC) and international non-governmental organization UPR.INFO held national consultations to discuss recommendations provided to Uzbekistan within the fourth universal periodic review (UPR) cycle.
In November last year, as a result of the review of its national report by the United Nations Human Rights Council’s UPR Working Group, Uzbekistan received 234 recommendations. The consultations provided an opportunity for representatives of civil society organizations to advocate for the acceptance of recommendations which cover diverse human rights issues as well as to provide suggestions regarding measures to be taken to implement those recommendations effectively.
Prof. Akmal Saidov, the Director of the NHRC underlined that “We plan to analyze in detail all recommendations received within the fourth UPR cycle through consultations with the Parliament, Government, NHRI and civil society organizations in order to identify priority thematic areas within the received recommendations. As a result of national consultations, the Government will formulate its position on each recommendation. We intend to develop a “roadmap” in the form of a UPR national action plan”.
Ms Consuelo Vidal Bruce, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Uzbekistan commended the NHRC for initiating the consultations. She stressed that “Civil society is an important player in the UPR process and its members have wise advice and experience that needs to be taken into account”.
The event was attended by more than 60 representatives of Government, Parliament, the Ombudsman Office, civil society organizations as well as UN agencies.

Title: Informed today – Shaping tomorrow!
Content: 12 December 2023
On 12 December 2023, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and UNESCO MDP entered a new partnership to implement a comprehensive 3-year media programme in Uzbekistan with a total budget of USD 1.6 million.
Titled "Empowering the Government and Citizens of Uzbekistan by Strengthening Access to Information, Accountability of Institutions, and Media Competence," this initiative is designed to strengthen the citizens' access to information, reinforce institutional accountability, and enhance media competence across various sectors. The programme will be conducted in partnership with the Agency of Information and Mass Communications under the Presidential Administration.

A new Chapter in Media Development
This strategic collaboration follows Uzbekistan’s adoption of the new constitution on 30 April 2023, signaling a commitment to democratic reforms and the improvement of citizens' well-being. The new constitution underscores the need for effective implementation and robust mechanisms to address gaps in policy, institutions, and operations related to freedom of expression and access to information. The programme's primary focus areas include Media Legislation and Access to Information, Media Development, and Media & Information Literacy.
Media Legislation and Access to Information
In the realm of Media Legislation and Access to Information, the programme aims to continue efforts on refining the draft Information Code, ensuring it upholds principles of transparency, freedom expression, and access to information. This initiative includes an in-depth analysis on the use of Internet and access to information in Uzbekistan, consultations, and training sessions for governmental information providers, strengthening their capacity to respond effectively to information requests and manage public communication.
An extensive nationwide campaign through TV, radio, and social media will educate citizens on their right to access public information and the platforms available for this purpose. Additionally, an international conference will showcase Uzbekistan's progress in media legislation and access to information on a global stage.
Media Development
Under the umbrella of Media Development, the program will introduce new teaching and training materials for key institutions such as the Law Enforcement Academy, the Security Forces Academy, and the Judiciary Training Centre. These materials will enhance in-service education on freedom of expression and access to information, fostering a deeper understanding of these critical concepts among prosecutors, judicial actors, and security forces. Additionally, guidelines and a code of conduct will help to improve relationships between law enforcement officers and media professionals, and the adoption of a communication plan will ensure accountability and transparency of police institutions through effective communication with the public.
The programme will also update the UNESCO module for journalism education in Uzbekistan, ensuring alignment with international standards and will train journalism educators to effectively use the new curricula. In a significant move towards supporting the next generation of media professionals, a pre-existing learning platform tailored for young journalists and bloggers is set to provide state-of-the-art educational resources covering a range of topics including data journalism, fake news, gender aspects in journalism, and legal literacy. This initiative is further enriched by a specialized workshop designed for emerging journalists and bloggers.
Media & Information Literacy
The final pillar, Media & Information Literacy, seeks to develop a comprehensive strategy for media and information literacy at all levels. Research assessments will identify gaps and provide recommendations for improving media and information literacy in Uzbekistan. Policymaker training sessions will equip decision-makers with the knowledge and skills to integrate media and information literacy into policy development, while national consultations and high-level dialogues will pave the way for a national strategy with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.
This ambitious programme reflects the commitment of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and UNESCO to empower Uzbekistan's government and citizens by fostering a more transparent, accountable, and informed society.

Title: UN Joint Programme in Uzbekistan Enhances Social Services and Empowers Persons with Disabilities
Content: 06 December 2023
The Coordination Council of the Joint UN Programme “Transformation of Social Service Delivery: Implementing Human Rights Based Approach for Children, Youth and Women with Disabilities" held its final meeting.
During the span of 2022-2023, the participating UN entities including UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP, OHCHR, together with national partners worked to strengthen capacity for formulating inclusive programmes, development strategies, and budgets considering disability. Furthermore, the focus was on monitoring progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the monitoring of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Key achievements during the programme  implementation include the conduct of six training sessions reaching 194 participants, comprising 130 organizations of persons with disabilities and 24 self-initiative groups of parents of children with disabilities.
These sessions were designed to enhance the capacity of organizations across Uzbekistan, covering topics such as disability inclusion, legal literacy, protection of children from gender-based violence, and combating stigma and discrimination against girls, women, and underrepresented groups.
Additionally, 50,000 nurses were trained in early detection and intervention, 500 teachers underwent professional development, and 390 individuals received training focused on inclusive budgeting practices, disability measurement, and the application of Convention principles. Moreover, 184 youth representatives and organizations enhanced their capacity in disability rights approaches and engagement with human rights mechanisms.
“This necessitates a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and the private sector. We must strive to guarantee equal access to education, healthcare, employment, and essential services for persons with disabilities. Additionally, we must confront the negative attitudes and stereotypes that perpetuate discrimination and exclusion,” said Consuelo Vidal Bruce, UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan.
“Since its creation, the National Agency for Social Protection demonstrated a commitment to transition to a social model of disability assessment and determination, enhancing access to disability-inclusive infrastructure, services and programmes, community care and support services, and assistive technology. Road Map on inclusion of the social model into existing disability assessment and determination system has been developed with UN’s support,” said Alberto Biancoli, a.i UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan.
Furthermore, a specialized training module was developed for interdepartmental, multi-sectoral services, designed to address cases of gender-based violence involving individuals with disabilities. Over 200 representatives of medical, psychological, social, and law enforcement services, along with 38 representatives of disability organizations, were empowered to respond to such cases, including the provision of medical, social, and psychological assistance.
The UN Joint Programme was launched in May 2022 and implemented  by UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and OHCHR, with the ultimate goal of improving the delivery of social services through a rights-based approach for individuals with disabilities in Uzbekistan. A key emphasis of the Programme lies in the enhancement and establishment of accessible services at the grassroots level, ensuring inclusivity and empowerment for children and adults with disabilities.

Title: Sand and dust storm frequency increasing in many world regions, UN warns
Content: 14 November 2023
Two billion tons of sand and dust, equal in weight to 350 Great Pyramids of Giza, enter the atmosphere every year; UNCCD experts attribute over 25% of the problem to human activities
Wreaks havoc from Northern and Central Asia to sub-Saharan Africa; Health impacts poorly understood.
Sand and dust storms are an underappreciated problem now “dramatically” more frequent in some places worldwide, with at least 25% of the phenomenon attributed to human activities, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).
Accompanied by policy recommendations, the warning comes as a five-day meeting takes place in Samarkand, Uzbekistan to take stock of global progress in the Convention’s implementation.  The UNCCD is one of three Conventions originated at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The other two address climate change (UNFCCC) and biodiversity (UN CBD).
The meeting, 13-17 November (https://www.unccd.int/cric21), includes a high-level session on 15 November hosted by the Government of Uzbekistan on ways to address the impacts of sand and dust storms on global agriculture, industry, transportation, water and air quality, and human health.
“Sand and dust storms present a formidable challenge to achieving sustainable development. However, just as sand and dust storms are exacerbated by human activities, they can also be reduced through human actions,” adds Thiaw.
While sand and dust storms (SDS) are a regionally common and seasonal natural phenomenon, the problem is exacerbated by poor land and water management, droughts, and climate change, according to UNCCD experts.
And fluctuations in their intensity, magnitude, or duration “can make SDS unpredictable and dangerous.”
With impacts far beyond the source regions, an estimated 2 billion tons of sand and dust now enters the atmosphere every year, an amount equal in weight to 350 Great Pyramids of Giza.
In some areas, desert dust doubled in the last century.
“Sand and dust storms (SDS) have become increasingly frequent and severe having substantial transboundary impacts, affecting various aspects of the environment, climate, health, agriculture, livelihoods and the socioeconomic well-being of individuals.  The accumulation of impacts from sand and dust storms can be significant,” says Feras Ziadat, Technical Officer at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), Chair of the UN Coalition on Combating Sand and Dust Storms.
“In source areas, they damage crops, affect livestock, and strip topsoil. In depositional areas atmospheric dust, especially in combination with local industrial pollution, can cause or worsen human health problems such as respiratory diseases. Communications, power generation, transport, and supply chains can also be disrupted by low visibility and dust-induced mechanical failures. The United Nations Coalition on Combating Sand and Dust Storms, currently chaired by FAO, was created in 2019 to lead global efforts to tackle SDS.”
In their Sand and Dust Storms Compendium and accompanying SDS Toolbox (https://www.unccd.int/land-and-life/sand-and-dust-storms/toolbox), UNCCD, FAO and partners offer guidance on approaches and methodologies for collecting and assessing SDS data, monitoring and early warning, impact mitigation and preparedness, and source mapping and anthropogenic source mitigation at sub-national, national, regional and global levels.
The SDS discussion forms part of the agenda of this year’s meeting in Uzbekistan of the UNCCD’s Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC 21) and global progress in delivering the Convention’s strategic objectives. It marks the first time since its establishment that UNCCD has convened one of its most significant meetings in Central Asia.
The meeting comes at a critical juncture, as recent statistics published via UNCCD’s new data dashboard (https://data.unccd.int/) shows the world now losing nearly 1 million square kilometers of healthy and productive land every year – some 4.2 million square kilometers between 2015-2019, or roughly the combined area of five Central Asian nations: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
During the meeting (at 18:00 local time / 13:00 GMT, Tuesday 14 November) UNCCD and FAO experts will launch three reports:
Other items on the CRIC 21 agenda include promoting sustainable land management, ensuring fair land rights for women, and tackling droughts and wildfires exacerbated by climate change and environmental degradation.

Background: Sand and dust storms
Sand and dust storms (SDS) are known by many local names: the sirocco, haboob, yellow dust, white storms, or the harmattan.
While SDS can fertilize both land and marine ecosystems, they also present a range of hazards to human health, livelihoods and the environment.
SDS events typically originate in low-latitude drylands and sub-humid areas where vegetation cover is sparse or absent.
They can also occur in other environments, including agricultural and high-latitude areas in humid regions, when specific wind and atmospheric conditions coincide. SDS events can have substantial transboundary impacts, over thousands of kilometers. Unified and coherent global and regional policy responses are needed, especially to address source mitigation, early warning systems, and monitoring.
SDS often have significant economic impacts: for example, they cost the oil sector in Kuwait an estimated US$ 190 million annually, while a single SDS event in 2009 resulted in damage estimated at US$ 229 - 243 million in Australia.
The major global sources of mineral dust are in the northern hemisphere across North Africa, the Middle East and East Asia. In the southern hemisphere, Australia, South America and Southern Africa are the main dust sources.
More than 80% of Central Asia is covered by deserts and steppes which, coupled with climate change and lasting droughts, represent a major natural source of sand and dust storms.
The dried-up Aral Sea is a major source of SDS, emitting more than 100 million tons of dust and poisonous salts every year, impacting the health not just of the people living in the vicinity, but far beyond and generating annual losses of US$ 44 million.
Recognition of SDS as a disaster risk appears to be high in North-East Asia, parts of West Asia and North America but less prominent elsewhere.
Low recognition of SDS as a disaster risk is likely due to the lack (in many cases) of significant immediate direct human fatalities or injuries from individual SDS events, and limited consolidated documentation on their long-term health, economic or other impacts.
SDS and health
SDS can be life-threatening for individuals with adverse health conditions.
Fine dust particles are carried to high tropospheric levels (up to a few kilometres high) where winds can transport them over long distances.
The health implications of SDS have been under increased investigation for decades, with most studies conducted in East Asia, Europe and the Middle East. There has been a lack of studies in West Africa.
A particular focus of this research has been SDS modification of air pollution.
The cause-and-effect between sand and dust in the atmosphere and health outcomes remains unclear and requires more extensive study.  What can be said is that at-risk members of a population, especially those with pre-existing cardiopulmonary issues, including childhood asthma, may have a higher mortality or morbidity rate during a dust storm.
SDS can also impose major costs on the agricultural sector through crop destruction or reduced yield, animal death or lower yields of milk or meat, and damage to infrastructure.
For annual crops, losses are due to burial of seedlings or crops under sand deposits, loss of plant tissue and reduced photosynthetic activity as a result of sandblasting. This can lead to complete crop loss in a region or reduced yield.
There may also be a longer-term effect on some perennial crops due to tree or crop damage (such as lucerne/alfalfa crowns being damaged).
On a positive note, SDS dust can contain soil nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, as well as organic carbon. Some places benefit from this nutrient deposition on land, and mineral and nutrient deposition on water, particularly ocean bodies. When deposited, these can provide nutrients to downwind crop or pasture areas.  These limited benefits, however, are far outweighed by the harms done.
Globally, the main large dust sources are dried lakes; local sources include glacial outwash plains, volcanic ash zones and recently plowed fields.
The multi-faceted, cross-sectoral and transnational impacts of SDS directly affect 11 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals yet global recognition of SDS as a hazard is generally low due in part to the complexity and seasonally cumulative impact of SDS, coupled with limited data.
Insufficient information and impact assessments hinder effective decision-making and planning to effectively address SDS sources and impacts.
UNCCD helps governments create policies to promote the scaling-up of sustainable land management practices and to find and use the latest science to develop and implement effective mitigation policies.
Working with The Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia, UNCCD assists countries vulnerable to drought and sand and dust storms in Central Asia to develop and implement risk reduction strategies at national and regional level. UNCCD encourages countries to adopt a comprehensive risk reduction strategy with monitoring and early warning systems to improve preparedness and resilience to these environmental disasters.

About
The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is an international agreement on good land stewardship. It helps people, communities and countries create wealth, grow economies and secure enough food, clean water and energy by ensuring land users an enabling environment for sustainable land management. Through partnerships, the Convention’s 197 parties set up robust systems to manage drought promptly and effectively. Good land stewardship based on sound policy and science helps integrate and accelerate achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, builds resilience to climate change and prevents biodiversity loss.
The UNCCD Secretariat led the creation of the SDS Compendium document in collaboration with the UNCCD Science-Policy Interface (SPI), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN Women, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), and external experts and partners.

Title: Central Asia to host first-ever meeting of the UN treaty on desertification, land degradation and drought
Content: 09 November 2023
Media Advisory
21st Committee to Review the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC21) meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, 13-17 November 2023.
Bonn/Samarkand, 09/11/2023 - The twenty-first session of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC 21) to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) will be held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan from 13-17 November 2023.
CRIC21 will bring together an estimated 500 delegates from 196 countries and the European Union, civil society, and academia to reflect on progress in delivering the Convention’s strategic objectives. It marks the first time UNCCD convenes one of its most significant meetings in Central Asia, since its establishment.
This meeting comes at a critical juncture, as recent data launched by UNCCD shows that the world is losing nearly 100 million hectares of healthy and productive land every year. If current trends continue, 1.5 billion hectares of land will need to be restored by 2030 to achieve land degradation neutrality around the globe. But, halting additional degradation and accelerating existing commitments alone could surpass the neutrality target.
UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw said: “Droughts, wildfires and heatwaves we have witnessed around the world are the symptoms of the deepening and interlinked climate and nature crises, with land at the heart of both. Since 2015, some 4 million square kilometres of healthy and productive lands have been lost—an area roughly the size of Central Asia. We must urgently stop further land degradation and restore at least 1 billion hectares to meet global land targets by 2030.”
CRIC21 will be held at the Silk Road Samarkand Congress Centre. Parties will have the opportunity to review progress and provide recommendations towards achieving global targets to prevent and reverse land degradation, in line with the 2018-2030 UNCCD strategic and implementation frameworks.
Among the highlights of the CRIC21 programme:
Press briefings will be held throughout CRIC21 between 13:00-15:00 local time, including:
Notes to Editors

Title: Meeting of Civil Society Advisory Council of Uzbekistan Vision 2030 Fund
Content: 06 November 2023
In November 2023, second meeting of the Civil Society Advisory Council of the Uzbekistan Vision 2030 Fund was held.
This fund was established in 2022 based on the agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan on the procedure for the return of illegally acquired assets confiscated in Switzerland for the benefit of the population of the Republic of Uzbekistan. To ensure constructive interaction between the Fund and representatives of national and international civil society and academia, a Civil Society Advisory Council (CSAC) was established in March 2023 through a consultative process led by Civil Society representatives who developed the CSAC Terms of Reference. More information about objectives and responsibilities of CSAC members in the Documents section: https://mptf.undp.org/fund/uzb00.
During the three-day discussions, the civil society advisory council met with deputy ministers, heads of UN agencies in Uzbekistan, and members of the Uzbekistan Vision 2030 Fund's Management Committee.
The Fund’s management committee consists of Ms. Consuelo Vidal-Bruce, the UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan, Mr. Ilhom Norkulov- the First Deputy Minister of Finance and Economy of Uzbekistan, and Mr. Konstantin Obolensky- the Ambassador of Switzerland to Uzbekistan.
The Civil Society Advisory Council also visited the Perinatal Center located in Tashkent region. The first project financed by the Fund aims to significantly reduce preventable maternal and newborn deaths in Uzbekistan. One of the main goals of the new project is to increase the survival rate babies with low birth weight from the current 75% to 90%. About the project: https://mptf.undp.org/project/00140334
Uzbekistan Vision 2030 Fund supports the principled, transparent and efficient return of assets through programs aimed at accelerating the implementation of the national reform agenda and Sustainable Development Goals of the Government of Uzbekistan.

Title: UNICEF and Association of Disabled People of Uzbekistan Empower Organizations to Promote Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Content: 19 October 2023
The Association of Disabled People of Uzbekistan and UNICEF hosted the capacity building workshop: “Fundamentals of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.” This workshop marked the culmination of a series of training sessions to enhance the potential of self-initiative groups of parents of children with disabilities, as well as local and national Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) in Uzbekistan.
In 2022-2023, approximately 200 representatives of organizations of people with disabilities in Namangan, Kokand, Bukhara, Samarkand, Nukus and Tashkent participated in trainings. Throughout the training sessions, parent groups received valuable legal and advisory support regarding the registration of OPDs and the continued development of their organizations. Moreover, representatives from over 40 organizations of persons with disabilities acquired skills to effectively advocate for the rights of people with disabilities at both the local and national levels.
Addressing participants of the workshop, Geoffrey Ijumba, UNICEF Deputy Representative in Uzbekistan, emphasized the significance of meaningful and sustainable participation of persons with disabilities in ensuring the successful implementation of all programmes, not just those related to disability. This collaboration between UNICEF and the Association of Disabled People of Uzbekistan signifies a step towards promoting the rights of persons with disabilities and fostering a more inclusive society.
This crucial initiative falls under the United Nations Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) Joint Programme "Transformation of Social Services Delivery: Implementing a Human Rights-Based Approach for Children, Youth, and Women with Disabilities in Uzbekistan." One of the programme’s key objectives is to strengthen the capacity of OPDs and facilitate the establishment of organizations that represent the interests of children with disabilities.

Title: UNOPS signed the Host Country Agreement with the Government of Uzbekistan
Content: 21 September 2023
UNOPS and the Government will work with partners to help deliver the Uzbekistan-2030 Strategy.
UNOPS has announced the signing of a Host Country Agreement with the government of Uzbekistan to help foster sustainable development and bolstering collaboration in Central Asia. The agreement signifies a crucial milestone in enhancing UNOPS' presence in Uzbekistan and amplifying its efforts in the region.
The agreement aligns with the Uzbekistan-2030 Strategy, which is centered on the upgrading of education, healthcare, and social protection systems that adhere to international standards. It also focuses on sustainable economic growth, environmental conservation, modern governance, and fostering a safe and peaceful state.
Jorge Moreira da Silva, UNOPS Executive Director, said:

Title: Uzbekistan advances efforts to reduce and end statelessness
Content: 19 September 2023
On 19 September, the National Human Rights Centre of the Republic of Uzbekistan (NHRC), jointly with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, presented a Comparative Legal Analytical Study on Statelessness in Uzbekistan, and Uzbek translation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union-UNHCR Handbook for Parliamentarians on Citizenship and Statelessness.
The publications were presented to Members of the Legislative Chamber and the Senate of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Authorized Person of the Oliy Majlis for Human Rights, and representatives of international organizations and development partners.
First Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan and Director of the NHRC, Akmal Saidov, delivered opening remarks alongside the UN Resident Coordinator in the Republic of Uzbekistan, Consuelo Vidal Bruce, and the UNHCR Representative for Central Asia, Hans Friedrich Schodder.
“The Republic of Uzbekistan is decisive strong steps to reduce and eradicate stateless on our territory”, said Professor Saidov. “Since 2014, more than one hundred thousand Stateless people have been identified in the Republic of Uzbekistan, and the cases of 83,793 have been resolved.”
Commissioned as part of the third joint annual workplan of the NHRC and UNHCR, the study provides a comprehensive legal analysis of the national legislation of Uzbekistan related to citizenship and statelessness and follow-up measures to harmonise legislation and practices.
The Handbook on Citizenship and Statelessness for Parliamentarians is a global publication with practical steps to reduce the incidence of statelessness, and examples of how protracted statelessness situations have been resolved through the joint work of governments, civil society, and the international community.
“The pursuit to end statelessness aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals and the core principle of leaving no one behind, as they strive to ensure the inclusion and protection of individuals,” said Ms. Consuelo Vidal Bruce.
Statelessness, or the situation of not being recognized as a citizen by any country, affects millions of people around the world. Stateless and undocumented people often cannot access the most basic of rights, including access to education, formal employment, health services or marriage registration.
In 2014, UNHCR launched the global #IBelong Campaign to End Statelessness. Since then, Uzbekistan has progressed well in addressing the rights of stateless people. Key achievements of Uzbekistan include passing of an improved Citizenship Law in 2020, and amending its birth registration practices.
At the 30th session of the Universal Periodic Review at the Human Rights Council in 2018, the Government of Uzbekistan supported recommendations to accede to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Also this week, the NHRC and UNHCR, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan, will convene a technical seminar on procedures for determining the status of a stateless person and standards of the 1954 Convention.
“We remain committed to supporting the Republic of Uzbekistan in accelerating achievement of the #IBelong Campaign to End Statelessness by 2024, including strengthening advice and support for accession to the 1954 and 1961 Statelessness Conventions,” said Mr. Schodder.
As of mid-2023, Uzbekistan hosts 25,413 stateless people – the largest number in Central Asia – most of whom are ex-citizens of the former Soviet Union and their descendants.
The NHRC and UNHCR have been cooperating since 2020 to support Uzbekistan’s capacity to implement UPR recommendations related to the reduction and prevention of statelessness and the protection of refugees.

Title: Empowering the Aral Sea Region: A Localized Leap Towards Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 16 September 2023
The United Nations in Uzbekistan, in collaboration with the Government of Uzbekistan, and the Government of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, jointly convened the "Localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Aral Sea Region."
This occasion brought together key stakeholders, including government representatives, local development organizations, academia, civil society, and international partners, to shed light on the intersection of sustainable development and SDG localization, emphasizing the vulnerabilities faced by regions like the Aral Sea.
SDG localization refers to the process of implementing the SDGs at the national and local levels by aligning them with local needs as it fosters ownership and action, ensures policy coherence, enhances data and monitoring systems, and encourages stakeholder engagement.

The event also featured a presentation of the findings from the Aral Sea Trust Fund's 2023 Needs Assessment for the Aral Sea, outlining its vital linkages to the SDGs as identified through a comprehensive study conducted earlier this year.
Consuelo Vidal, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan highlighted in her address that “At this midway point of the 2030 Agenda, it's clear that we need urgent action to tackle our current challenges. Without a significant increase in commitment, cooperation, and transformative measures, we risk falling short of achieving the SDGs, including crucial goals like poverty reduction, inequality reduction, and environmental protection.”
Sarvar Khamidov, Deputy Minister, the Ministry of Investments, Industry and Trade of the Republic of Uzbekistan said “Collaborative efforts within the Aral Sea Trust Fund helped to improve the healthcare system in five regions, improve basic infrastructure, digitalize rural communities, support youth and women by creating jobs and increasing their incomes. Our further vision for the Fund is the Aral Sea region shall become a zone for implementing efficient climate change innovations, which will benefit present and future generations.”
Rustam Saparbayev, Deputy Chairman of Jokargy Kenes of the Republic of Karakalpakstan concluded the event and pointed that: "I believe it is important to regularly organize such events to raise awareness of current issues and solutions. The Government at all levels is committed to actively supporting our development partners by providing the resources and capacity to make informed decisions. I want to assure you that our government can be expected to continuously support all initiatives aimed at improving the lives of the population."
In response to the social, economic, and environmental issues associated with the Aral Sea crisis, in 2018 the United Nations together with the Government of Uzbekistan with support from the Government of Norway, the European Union, Governments of Finland, the Republic of Korea, Germany, and the Alwaleed Philanthropies established the Aral Sea Trust Fund.
Through the various Joint Programmes of eight participating UN organizations, such as FAO, UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, UNOPS, UNODC, and UNESCO the UN delivered jointly the interventions that focus among others on water management, sustainable agriculture, healthcare, and environmental restoration that benefitted 274,000 people including youth, women, and the elderly.

Title: Restitution: New UN Programme to Reduce Preventable Maternal and Newborn Deaths in Uzbekistan
Content: 15 September 2023
The Uzbekistan Vision 2030 Fund, also known as the "Ishonch Fund," has announced a commitment allocation of USD43.5 million to support a new UN joint programme aimed at significantly reducing preventable maternal and newborn deaths in Uzbekistan. One of the key goals of the new programme is to increase the survival rate of low-birth-weight babies from seventy-five percent to ninety percent.
Further to the Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Uzbekistan on the Modalities for the Return of Illegally Acquired Assets Forfeited in the Swiss Confederation to the Benefit of the Population of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Uzbekistan Vision 2030 Fund is capitalized through a contribution representing a return of assets that have been definitively forfeited in criminal proceedings in Switzerland. The Fund, administered by the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office, will support principled, transparent, and effective asset restitution via programs aimed at accelerating the Government of Uzbekistan’s national reform agenda and the SDGs.
Consuelo Vidal-Bruce, the UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan, stated, "The return of assets to countries of origin is a fundamental principle of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). The contribution to the Fund, unlocked by the restitution agreement between Uzbekistan and Switzerland, will enable concrete advancements of the SDGs and directly improve the lives of Uzbekistan's citizens. This UN programme will reach 600,000 women and neonates within thirty months."
The new UN joint programme will be implemented jointly by UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO and will achieve these results through three key interventions:
The Programme aligns with Uzbekistan's commitment towards achieving the SDGs and the 2022-2026 Development Strategy, emphasizing the enhancement of healthcare accessibility and quality. This commitment encompasses a range of reforms, including bolstering primary healthcare, emergency medical services, and support for vulnerable populations. Programme page: https://mptf.undp.org/project/00140334.
Ilhom Norkulov, First Deputy Minister of Finance and Economy of Uzbekistan, expressed, "Uzbek citizens will directly experience the positive impact as their communities gain access to perinatal centers equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and highly trained medical professionals. This collaboration exemplifies the Uzbek government's ongoing commitment to delivering tangible reforms. We are thrilled to partner with the UN and the Government of Switzerland on this transformative initiative which will help to achieve the government’s strategy to halve the infant mortality rate."
The Ambassador of Switzerland to Uzbekistan, Konstantin Obolensky, emphasized the importance of transparency in Fund management, stating, “Transparency is vital because it enables a clear tracking of funds. This clarity empowers civil society to easily understand how resources are distributed and utilized. When the public and civil society can observe the allocation of their funds, it fosters accountability and efficient resource allocation. This is especially important to take into account as the funds come from illicit sources."
The Uzbekistan Ishonch Fund is supported by an independent Civil Society Advisory Council, comprising nineteen members from both national and international civil society organizations. This council plays a pivotal role in promoting dialogue and collaboration between the Fund and civil society, serving as a consultative body. Importantly, civil society holds a significant position on the Project Assessment Committee, responsible for evaluating all project proposals before final decisions are made.
Sayyora Khodjaeva, an Independent Uzbek Democracy and Human Rights Lawyer who chairs the Fund's Civil Society Advisory Council, expressed her support, stating, "We endorse this new programme, and we are pleased to see these funds rightfully returned to the people of Uzbekistan. As independent civil society activists, we will closely monitor the programme's implementation to ensure it delivers maximum value for ordinary citizens."

Content: 05 September 2023
United Nations in Uzbekistan and Westminster International University Collaborate to Spotlight Uzbekistan's Private Sector Contributions to Sustainable Development Goals.
The United Nations in Uzbekistan, in collaboration with Westminster International University in Tashkent, hosted the "Championing Business Sustainability in Uzbekistan” event, which had its inaugural ceremony in 2022. This year’s event, held on 5th September 2023, at Westminster International University in Tashkent, focused on a “Conversation Unveiling Uzbekistan’s Private Sector Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals." As in its inaugural forum, the Conversation provided a platform for key stakeholders to engage in discussions on the private sector's role in advancing sustainable development in Uzbekistan.
The Government of Uzbekistan has long been dedicated to sustainable development principles and the 2030 Agenda. Throughout the years, the nation has implemented forward-looking policies aimed at fostering sustainable economic and social growth. In this journey, the private sector has emerged as one of the drivers of reform and progress.
Ms. Consuelo Vidal, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Uzbekistan, noted, "Uzbekistan's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The government's policies, coupled with the private sector's engagement, have set the stage for advancing the concept of sustainability. Gone are the days when profit and sustainability were viewed as opposing forces. The private sector is demonstrating that economic growth, social progress, and environmental stewardship can go hand in hand. And Uzbekistan's business community has joined this paradigm shift."
The event sought to amplify the contributions of the private sector to Uzbekistan's journey towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It recognized the private sector's significance beyond economic growth, acknowledging its role as a catalyst for social progress and environmental sustainability. The private sector plays a crucial role in generating employment opportunities, producing, and distributing goods and services, and driving innovation to address development challenges.
Mr. Bakhrom Mirkasimov, Rector of Westminster International University in Tashkent, stated, "The academic sector, in general, and, in particular, Westminster International University, plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem. Our research, expertise, and commitment to education contribute to evidence-based solutions that drive progress."
As part of the event, the United Nations in Uzbekistan highlighted the findings of a survey that explored the private sector's understanding of sustainable development and its efforts in support of the SDGs. Compiled after a survey involving 12 diverse business entities, the business-focused SDG report illuminated the multifaceted ways in which private sector activities align with the guiding principles of the SDGs. Dr. Rusyan Jill Mamiit, Development Coordination Officer for Partnerships and Development Finance at the United Nations in Uzbekistan, presented key findings from the report, revealing that participating companies have significantly advanced all 16 SDGs adopted by Uzbekistan, covering an impressive 49 national SDG targets. Among these goals, SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), and SDG 5 (Gender Equality) received the most support.
During the conversation between and among the private sector stakeholders, Mr. Zafar Kashimov, Founder and Chairman of Supervisory Board of Korzinka, shared insights into responsible supply chains, noting, "Sustainability is a journey that requires collaboration across the supply chain, from sourcing to delivery." Further, Mr. Benoit Lemonne, General Director of Nurlikum Mining, emphasized the significance of responsible resource management, stating, "We must adopt responsible mining practices to safeguard the environment and support local communities."
Mr. Bekhzod Khojiakhmedov, Head of Strategic Transformation Department of Artel discussed the importance of corporate strategies for sustainability, stating, "Sustainability is not just about doing good but also about ensuring long-term business viability." In the textile and garment industry, Mr. Mirmukhsin Sultanov, First-Deputy Chairman of Uzbekistan Textile and Garment Industry Association emphasized the private sector's role, stating, "Private sector leadership is vital to advance sustainable development and the promotion of decent work as well as labor rights." Mr. Nurbek Ilkhomiy, General Manager of Takro-Osiyo provided a complementary statement, highlighting, "Our presence here reflects the private sector's pivotal role as a driving force for positive change, an advocate for sustainable practices, and a catalyst for transformative impact on employment."
Mr. Alisher Khaitmetov, Chief Executive Officer of Veolia Energy Tashkent, concluded the event by reaffirming the private sector's commitment, stating, "Let us recognize that the private sector’s legacy is not defined by the present moment alone, but rather by the collective future we are shaping." He highlighted Veolia Energy Tashkent's commitment to multiple SDGs, including clean energy, job creation, and responsible consumption and production.
The event served as a call to action for the private sector to continue its journey towards sustainability, innovate, and invest in sustainable practices that benefit society and the environment. It also highlighted the importance of collaboration between the private sector, academia, and the United Nations in advancing sustainable development objectives.
As a result of this event, the private sector's contributions to sustainable development in Uzbekistan are more widely recognized and celebrated. Partnerships have been strengthened, and a shared commitment to sustainability and the SDGs has been reaffirmed.

Title: Uzbekistan - strengthening digital skills to build a safe cyberspace for children
Content: 16 August 2023
Uzbekistan stands as one of the CIS countries that continues to actively implement the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Global Programme on Child Online Protection (COP). In the present year, the ITU Regional Office for the CIS, in close cooperation with the Ministry of Digital Technologies of the Republic of Uzbekistan and national partners, has successfully concluded various activities aimed at developing children's digital literacy and ensuring their safety on the Internet.
Together with UNICON.UZ, the ITU Guidelines on Online Safety for policy-makers, industry, parents and educators were developed and localised into the Uzbek language. Consequently, official guidelines and recommendations on internet safety are now available in the state language and can be widely used, which is particularly relevant in remote regions and rural areas of Uzbekistan. These translated documents are now being actively disseminated to the target audience.
"The Ministry of Digital Technologies of the Republic of Uzbekistan endeavors to create a safe environment for our children, where they can freely use the opportunities of the Internet without being exposed to threats and dangers. Children's safety on the Internet is our priority. We are working with the International Telecommunication Union to provide our children with the knowledge and tools they need to use the web safely and effectively. Only through joint efforts can we create a healthy and secure online environment for our children," said Umida Musayeva, Head of the International Relations Division of the Ministry of Digital Technologies of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
In Uzbekistan, state authorities will use these Guidelines to formulate national policies and strategies that align with contemporary global Internet safety trends. In parallel, industry organizations will have the capacity to leverage the Guidelines to establish safer and more secure services tailored for children. Simultaneously, parents and educators will gain valuable insights to assist them in recognizing potential threats and risks children might encounter online. This guidance will empower them to preempt and effectively address these challenges in a timely manner.
Also, in partnership with IT-Park Uzbekistan experts, the course materials "Information Security in Digital Education Space", developed by the ITU Regional Office together with the UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education, were successfully localized and translated into Uzbek.
These materials form the basis of an online course available on the https://cop-itpark.uz/ platform. The course is specifically designed to provide training for teachers and individuals who engage with children in their professional roles, and it is offered free of charge. It consists of several modules covering the following topics: information security issues, basic legislation in the field of information technology and information protection, the relationship between the use of digital devices and children's mental health, organizing children's information security behavior in the digital space, cyber hygiene and cyber security for students, computer viruses and analysis of software products aimed at ensuring children's information security in the digital educational space. Upon successful completion of the course, each participant receives a certificate that attests to their accomplished training and signifies their capability to apply the acquired knowledge in their everyday undertakings.
"The localization and translation of the course materials 'Information Security in the Digital Educational Space' into Uzbek language will allow me, my fellow teachers and other professionals working with children to be more widely involved in acquiring up-to-date knowledge and skills on internet safety. I gained valuable insights from the course, including aspects related to information security, the correlation between the use of digital devices and children's mental well-being, cyber hygiene. The course proved to be exceedingly beneficial and useful," shared Mahfuza Kopalova, a participant of the programme."
Furthermore, in collaboration with the IT-Academy of Uzbekistan, a series of localized training sessions were carried out across 14 regions of Uzbekistan. These workshops were conducted in the national language and were attended by 305 teachers (275 men and 30 women) affiliated with IT Parks and IT-Academies. Each participant received a training certificate for completing this information security course. The plan is for these trained instructors to apply their newfound knowledge over the next six months while teaching IT courses, thereby imparting the fundamentals of online child protection to their students on a consistent basis.
"We aim to provide teachers and education professionals with the necessary tools and knowledge to be able to effectively protect children online. By distributing the course materials and conducting trainings in different regions of Uzbekistan, we will be able to expand our reach and provide sustainable training on the basics of child protection in the online space. We are pleased to cooperate with the International Telecommunication Union and to be able to make a meaningful contribution to ensuring children's safety in the digital space," said Dmitry Ten, Director of IT-Academy, Uzbekistan."
Uzbekistan continues to actively develop measures to ensure children's safety on the Internet. The introduction of educational programmes, teacher training and the creation of online resources are becoming key steps in creating a safe and informed cyberspace for children. A photo album of the series of trainings for teachers in Uzbekistan can be viewed here.

Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in September at UN in New York
New York, 5 July 2023 -  The United Nations, today, is kicking off a communications campaign to rally for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015. Ahead of a critical UN Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda for our common future.
At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the SDGs is in peril. For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.
The 2023 SDG Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the SDGs.
Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the UN campaign aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.
Building off the color wheel brand of the SDGs, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the SDGs.
One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the SDGs through the UN’s ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the SDGs and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.
A curated group of high-profile influencers, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their communities to take individual action on the SDGs and to impress upon decision-makers the urgency to act now.

Title: New Project on mitigating the impact and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in Central Asia
Content: 01 June 2023
A new project “Central Asia COVID-19 Crisis Response (CACCR) - PHASE 2” developed by WHO EURO and European Commission's Directorate-General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA) was presented to national partners, national and regional EPI managers, regional immunization trainers team members, representatives of epidemiology service.
The agenda of the meeting was very extensive: the implementation of the project in the regions in line with the strategic priorities of National Immunization Plan of Action, with specific emphasis to address immunization inequity at subnational/community level and devise locally tailored interventions to achieve and sustain high vaccination coverage, experiences on specific immunization challenges, including Measles-rubella and other Vaccine-preventable disease, immunization information systems, vaccine safety systems, and hepatitis B control.
The overall objective of this project is to contribute to mitigating the impact and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in Central Asia and reinforcing their longer-term health resilience. More specifically, the project will provide assistance for:  a rapid and safe roll-out of vaccines, including setting up necessary information management systems and capacity building of health care workers and professionals involved in vaccination roll-out; building long-term resilience of routine immunization systems to manage future vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, including adequate monitoring and evaluation practices, development of national immunization plans and addressing vaccination inequity and  building the capacity of CAR to achieve universal health coverage through the digitalization of health systems and increased ability to collect and use quality health data. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance for countries to strive for a resilient health system within the domain of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Building upon the good practices of the implementation of the Phase one of the project, a primary health care approach focusing on organizing and strengthening health systems will be emphasized so that people can access essential primary health care services including immunization, infection prevention and control.
National immunization programme achieved very good results both in providing sustainability immunization programme during pandemic period and in quick deployment of COVID-19 vaccination in practice. Uzbekistan reached very good COVID-19 vaccination coverage. According to Administrative data 87.4% of all population older than 19 year received full initial vaccination course and 81.5% received first booster dose.
Despite of end of COVID-19 PHEIC, COVID-19 still playing a role in the development of severe complications and consequences leading to death. The virus is here to stay, and countries need to integrate COVID-19 surveillance and response activities into routine health programmes. Further step should be addressed on Integration COVID-19 vaccination into life course vaccination programmes and maintain efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage for all people in the high-priority groups.
Uzbekistan is moving forward in this direction, already COVID-19 vaccination indicated in the National SanPIN (Sanitary rules and norms) “Immunoprofilaxis”. But still some gaps: vaccine coverage among people other 60 years is about 66%. It is necessary to pay more efforts on increase vaccination coverage in that group, because people older 60 years is under the highest risk of development severe case and death.
The pandemic has revealed many problems in the healthcare system, but it has also revealed strengths. Human potential has become the main factor in the success of the implementation of anti-epidemic measures and crisis response. Continuation of capacity building process a key element in ensuring the safety of the population and the sustainability of medical programs, including vaccines.
Capacity building makes it possible to significantly strengthen human resources, redistribute them and use them more efficiently.
The project is based on the principle that “no one is safe until everyone is safe”, as outlined in the Communication of 19 January 2021 on a united front to beat COVID-19. This Action will support deployment of vaccines received by CAR through COVAX, the EU sharing mechanisms, and direct procurement from producers of COVID-19 vaccines. The project will be also embedded into the Team Europe approach focused on the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 “Good Health and Well-being”.

The Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration (FOLUR) Impact Programme is based on the growing recognition that food production systems and land use must improve for the health of people, planet, and economies. With financing of USD 345 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and expected additional co-financing of over USD 2.7 billion, FOLUR promotes sustainable integrated landscapes and efficient food value chains at scale.
FOLUR seeks to transform global food and land use systems, targeting large production landscapes for eight commodities: cocoa, corn, coffee, livestock, palm oil, rice, soy, and wheat. Structured with a Global Platform and 27 country projects – FOLUR aims to transform the global food and land use systems through projects that restore degraded landscapes and intensify sustainable land management practices.
Since 2022 FAO Uzbekistan Country Office in cooperation with the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture implements FOLUR in Uzbekistan” funded by GEF. Project objective is to scale up the best practices and innovations for sustainable and inclusive wheat-based production landscapes and value chains.
On 17-20 April 2023 the first FOLUR Annual Meeting took place in Sao Paulo, Brazil, which boasts a thriving agriculture sector and critical biomes like the Amazon forest and Cerrado savanna. The Annual Meeting was attended by the Uzbek delegation consisted of Alisher Shukurov, Advisor to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Jakhongir Talipov, Head of Department/GEF OFP, International Cooperation and Projects of the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Aziz Nurbekov, National Coordinator and Oydin Nurullaeva, Administrative Assistant of FOLUR project in Uzbekistan.
During the meeting Aziz Nurbekov has shared overview of progress, challenges and opportunities of the project implementation in Uzbekistan.
The FOLUR Annual Meeting was the first in-person meeting for members of the Impact Program and brought together FOLUR members for relationship-building, knowledge exchange and training, showcasing lessons and accelerating impact. The meeting enabled participants to learn more about the country projects' goals and challenges and share how the Global Platform and partners can accelerate country-level implementation.

Title: Uzbekistan will align its national biodiversity policy to Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
Content: 12 April 2023
Global Biodiversity Framework Early Action Support (GBF-EAS) initiative was launched on 12 April 2023 in Central Ecopark of Tashkent. This initiative is a new joint endeavour of the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) funded by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF).
On 19 December 2022, an Agreement was reached by 190 countries on the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). This historic framework sets out an ambitious pathway to reach the global vision of a world living in harmony with nature by 2050. Among the Framework’s key elements are 4 goals for 2050 and 23 targets for 2030. It provides a good foundation for global action on biodiversity, complementing the Paris Agreement for Climate, paving the way towards a climate-neutral, nature-positive, and resilient world by 2050.
In adopting the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, Uzbekistan as many other countries worldwide committed to setting its national targets to implement it. The launched project will support the government of Uzbekistan in revising its National Strategy and Action Plan for the conservation of biodiversity as well as relevant policies, monitoring, and financing of nature conservation in such a way that they correspond to the agenda of the global biodiversity conservation programme.
Mr. Aziz Abdukhakimov, Minister of Natural resources of Uzbekistan, noted in his address at the event that
Ms. Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan in her welcoming speech highlighted that
Some of the key global targets include restoring 30% of degraded ecosystems globally by 2030, stop the extinction of known species, and by 2050 reduce tenfold the extinction risk and rate of all species, reducing risk from pesticides by at least 50% by 2030, sustainably manage areas under agriculture, fisheries, and forestry and substantially increase agroecology and other biodiversity-friendly practices. The full list of targets can be found at the link.
For the next two years, the project will collaborate with a diverse group of national and international stakeholders, including line ministries, agencies, academia and science community, NGOs to fast-track readiness and early actions to implement the post-2020 biodiversity conservation priorities and to align national targets, monitoring, policy, and finance frameworks with the Global Biodiversity Framework.

Content: 28 March 2023
On 28 March UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, in cooperation with local partners distributed humanitarian aid sent to Mazar-i-Sharif through Termez, Uzbekistan, among internally displaced persons in Balkh province of Afghanistan. 241 persons benefitted from this aid, including blankets delivered in February 2023 from UNHCR Regional Humanitarian Logistics Hub in Termez with support of the Government of Uzbekistan.
This humanitarian assistance, which consisted of blankets and hygiene kits, will help to address current needs of families displaced from seven provinces of Afghanistan. “These blankets are huge assistance for me and my family. Now we live in a tent, we have no mattresses, no pillows, no blankets,” said Tair, 30 year-old Afghan currently residing in Khairabad.
“UNHCR is committed to continuing to do everything we can to assist displaced Afghans, both within Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. We appreciate the support of the Government of Uzbekistan in delivering humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan through Termez," said Frank Remus, UNHCR Senior Liaison Officer.
In February 2023 UNHCR sent 12 trucks with over 48,000 blankets through its hub in Termez to provide life-saving assistance to forcibly displaced persons and other vulnerable people in Afghanistan. The Regional Humanitarian Logistics Hub of the UN Refugee Agency in Termez, established in 2021 with support of the Government of Uzbekistan, serves as a main consolidation and transfer point to deliver core relief items to UNHCR operations in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Central Asia and beyond.

Title: National Human Rights Center and UNHCR presented recommendations for development of asylum legislation in Uzbekistan
Content: 17 March 2023
On 17 March the National Human Rights Centre of the Republic of Uzbekistan (NHRC) jointly with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, held a presentation of the Analytical Report on the legislation and practice of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the context of the prospect of joining the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, for representatives the Senate and the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the office of the Ombudsman, the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State Security Service, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Law Enforcement Academy, the University of Public Security, the Tashkent State Law University, the University of World Economy and Diplomacy and representatives of UN agencies and diplomatic missions.
The event was opened by Consuelo Vidal-Bruce, United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i. in Uzbekistan, Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia, Dilnoza Muratova, Deputy Director of the National Human Rights Centre of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
“Today, due to global geopolitical crises, unfortunately, the number of people who are forced to leave their country, forcibly displaced or seeking political asylum is constantly increasing. In such a difficult and dangerous situation, the world community, international organisations and countries in the world, in connection with the presence of a serious threat to the life and freedom of their citizens, began to especially sharply coordinate their actions related to the protection and support of people who left their country and are in need of asylum and socio-economic help,” said Dilnoza Muratova, Deputy Director of the Center, in her speech.
“The United Nations in Uzbekistan is very pleased that close cooperation between the Government and UNHCR brought to our attention today a comprehensive legal analysis of the national legislation related to refugee issues. I trust that it will serve as a valuable resource and reliable guide for Members of Parliament and government officials to establish a national asylum system in line with international standards and good practices,” said Consuelo Vidal-Bruce, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Uzbekistan.
The analysis was conducted by UNHCR upon request of the NHRC to support Uzbekistan’s intention expressed at the 30th session of the Universal Periodic Review for Human Rights of the United Nations Human Rights Council to consider accession to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
“UNHCR trusts that this analysis and its recommendations will support the development of national legislation, practices, and institutions in the areas of asylum and refugee protection which would eventually implement all provisions of international law and human rights standards to the benefit of the Republic of Uzbekistan. UNHCR stands ready to offer further expertise and support to the Government and Parliament of Uzbekistan in this important area of human rights,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia.
The NHRC and UNHCR have been cooperating since 2020 to support Uzbekistan’s capacity to implement UPR recommendations related to the reduction and prevention of statelessness and the protection of refugees. Having jointly published a number of important studies, which are all available also in Uzbek language on the websites of the NCHR and UNHCR in Central Asia, in 2023 they will continue organizing a series of joint events, sharing expertise and best practices, to strengthen know-how and capacities in the protection of refugees and stateless persons.

Title: The Secretary -General Oped for International Women’s Day
Content: 07 March 2023
Around the world, progress on women’s rights is vanishing before our eyes. The latest forecasts estimate that on our current track, it will take another 300 years to reach full gender equality.
Today’s cascading crises, from the war in Ukraine to the climate emergency, affect women and girls first and worst. And as part of the global pushback against democracy, women’s rights over their bodies and autonomy over their lives are being questioned and denied.
Two statistics make our failure very clear:
Every ten minutes, one woman or girl is murdered by a family member or intimate partner.
And one woman dies every two minutes during pregnancy or childbirth. Most of those deaths are entirely preventable.
On International Women’s Day, we must commit to doing better. We need to reverse these horrific trends and stand up for the lives and rights of women and girls, everywhere.
This is one of my core priorities and a central plank of the work of the United Nations around the world.
From South Sudan to Myanmar, we are supporting women and girls in crisis and making sure their voices are heard in peace processes.
The Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, recently visited Afghanistan with a message for the authorities: women and girls have fundamental human rights, and we will never give up fighting for them.
This year, International Women’s Day focuses on closing gender gaps in science, technology, and innovation. Globally, men are 21 percent more likely to be online than women — and over 50 percent more likely in low-income countries.
But even the richest countries lose out because of gender-based stereotypes and historic bias. In the tech industry, men outnumber women two to one.  In Artificial Intelligence, it’s five to one.
Big data is the new gold, and the foundation of today’s political and business decisions. But it often ignores gender differences – or turns a blind eye to women altogether.
We should all be alarmed by products and services that bake in gender inequality right from the start, and digitize patriarchy and misogyny.
The Silicon Valleys of this world must not become Death Valleys for women’s rights.
Medical decisions based on data from men’s bodies can not only harm women; it can be deadly.
Discrimination against women in science and technology is the result of centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and damaging stereotypes. Women account for just three percent of Nobel Prize winners in scientific categories since 1901. And women online – including scientists and journalists – are often targeted for sexist hate speech and abuse designed to silence and shame them.
But they will not be silenced. Women and girls everywhere are demanding their rights, and their words reverberate around the world.
We need action on several fronts to make sure women and girls can make their full contribution to the world’s knowledge through science and technology.
We must break down barriers — from discriminatory data to stereotypes that push girls away from studying scientific subjects at an early age.
Decisionmakers of all kinds must broaden women’s participation and leadership in science and technology, through quotas if necessary.
They should be creative, widening the recruitment pipeline and hiring for skills. And they must be persistent. Gender equality will not happen by itself; it has to be prioritized and pursued. This approach is getting results at the United Nations, where we have our own strategy for gender parity among our personnel.
We also need action to create a safe digital environment for women and to hold accountable both the perpetrators of online abuse, and the digital platforms that enable them.
The United Nations is working with governments, civil society, the private sector and others on a Code of Conduct aimed at reducing harm and increasing accountability on digital platforms, while defending freedom of expression.
Women’s rights are not a luxury that can wait until we solve the climate crisis, end poverty and create a better world.
Investing in women and girls is the surest way to uplift all people, communities and countries, and to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Together, let’s work for a more inclusive, just, and prosperous world for women and girls, men and boys, everywhere.

“Our cooperation with Uzbekistan is now embracing the full of ILO mandate. Uzbekistan has become one of our flagship countries that might inspire other countries to engage with ILO. The Decent Work Country Programme for Uzbekistan 2021-2025 is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Heinz Koller, ILO Assistant Director-General, Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia. “The Government of Uzbekistan is now rightly concentrating on poverty reduction which is an ambitious and not easy task.

Title: FAO facilitates dialogue on financing agricultural transformation
Content: 15 February 2023
Today, for the sixth time, ministers from Central Asian countries gathered virtually to share experiences on current agricultural issues. The meeting, facilitated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, provided a platform for representatives of the five countries to discuss how agricultural finances serve a sustainable increase in production.
The vast landscapes of Central Asia with their various climatic and soil conditions offer great potential for agricultural production. Yet, the abundance of resources is not sufficient, and the expansion of agricultural productivity remained relatively slow since the 1990s. To increase efficiency and sustainability and modernize the sector, further investments are required from farmers themselves, as well as from the state.
“If done in a sustainable manner, faster growth in agricultural productivity can lead to improved food and nutrition security in Central Asia,” said Vladimir Rakhmanin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia.
The agriculture sector not only produces food but provides employment for a significant portion of the population in almost all five Central Asian countries, hence, the development of the sector is key in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
“The sustainable functioning and development of agriculture requires significant financial investments both from internal and external sources of the country,” said the Minister of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Aziz Voitov. - Without them, it is impossible to introduce expensive modern technologies and innovative methods that increase productivity and save resources. In addition, it is important to simultaneously develop social and economic infrastructure in rural areas and invest significant resources in increasing the human potential and competencies of farmers.”
Achieving faster agricultural growth sustainably requires farmers to invest in new technologies, including improved inputs (seeds, plants, and fertilizers), small-scale on-farm works and equipment, as well as breeding stock. To this end, ministers discussed innovative financing schemes to facilitate such development that, at the same time, are environmentally sustainable enhancing biodiversity, soil fertility and efficiency of water use.
Meeting participants also shared proven approaches and promising ideas on how to allocate public funds in a targeted way to ensure maximum impact in spurring agricultural growth. These include infrastructural investments (roads, irrigation system), promoting agricultural research and education, and better natural resource management. Beyond these, changes in the tax schemes, direct and indirect subsidies, tariffs, and import quotas can also influence the development of the agriculture sector. As a starting point, the current system of governmental expenditures on agricultural growth promotion should be screened and better understood.
Organized jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the meeting welcomed recommendations from other relevant UN agencies and international financial institutions, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Eurasian Development Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and World Bank.

Title: UNHCR and Uzbekistan provide winter assistance for Afghanistan
Content: 08 February 2023
The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, with the support of the Government of Uzbekistan, today sent 12 trucks with over 48,000 blankets through the International Multifunctional Transport and Logistics Hub in Termez, Uzbekistan, to Afghanistan to provide life-saving assistance to forcibly displaced persons and other vulnerable people in Afghanistan during harsh winter.
The consignments were dispatched from UNHCR’s Regional Humanitarian Logistics Hub established with support of the Government of Uzbekistan in October 2021. Located in the Termez Cargo Centre – 2km from the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan border – the hub enables UNHCR to rapidly replenish national stockpiles, in the region and be more agile in its humanitarian response.
“UNHCR jointly with the Government of Uzbekistan are making all efforts to continue most critical life-saving humanitarian aid to the Afghan population. This is vital, especially during this cold winter. Thanks to support by the Uzbek Government and local partners, UNHCR can quickly assist to meet urgent needs of women, children, and men in Afghanistan,” said Mr. Frank Remus, UNHCR Senior Liaison Officer.
The Termez hub serves as the main consolidation and transfer point to deliver assistance to UNHCR’s operations in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Central Asia and beyond. In 2021-2022, the hub sent 217 trucks of essential relief items needed by households forcibly displaced as well as when caught up in natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. Critical relief items dispatched from UNHCR’s Termez Regional Humanitarian Logistics Hub include sleeping mats, tarpaulins, heavy duty buckets, blankets, stainless steel kitchen sets, jerry cans, and portable solar LED lamps.
Natural disasters like earthquakes in northwestern Afghanistan (January 2022), southeastern Afghanistan (June 2022) and eastern Afghanistan (September 2022) as well as record summertime flooding in Afghanistan and in neighbouring Pakistan saw significant distribution efforts of emergency relief supplies.  In 2022 UNHCR aided 5.9 million persons throughout all 34 provinces of Afghanistan with core relief items and cash assistance as well as protection and reintegration activities.

Title: FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programmes: Uzbekistan’s experience
Content: 25 January 2023
On 24 January, the Uzbek delegation formed from the representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Natural Resources of Uzbekistan, the Tashkent State Agrarian University and the FAO Country Office in Uzbekistan took part in a regional workshop in Baku (Republic of Azerbaijan). The workshop was focused on the results and successes of recently implemented projects of the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programmes (FTPP) and included high-level representatives of relevant institutions in the countries of the subregion.
Currently, Uzbekistan is involved in 8 regional projects of FAO-Türkiye Partnership Programmes. Speaking at the regional Workshop Ramin Gasanov, Director of Department of Monitoring of IFI’s and Grant Projects of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, noted:  “We very much appreciate the on-going FTPP projects that enhance food security and decrease rural poverty and vulnerability. Uzbekistan has excellent political and economic bilateral relations with all the beneficiaries of the FTPP. We recognize FTPP as an efficient platform to share experience with each other, facilitating  capacity building opportunities, data and technology exchange.”
The workshop included various panel discussions on good practices highlighting project successes with a focus on gender and rural development as well as on the future of the FTPP. During the panel session Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan shared experience of successful implementation of the FTPP projects in Uzbekistan and took part in discussions on the relationship between FAO’s “four betters” concept and innovations in production, nutrition, environment, and life.
“All the FTPP projects are align with the FAO-Uzbekistan Country Programming Framework 2021-2025 and the country’s national priorities addressed in the respective sub-sectors to achieve sustainable agriculture development and food security. In this regard, the FAO Country Office in Uzbekistan is doing its best to contribute to this dynamic collaborative process by assisting in setting national priorities and ensuring well-aligned implementation of the FTPP strategies together with national partners and other stakeholders,” said Sherzod Umarov.
The last panel was dedicated to the communication and visibility activities of the FTPP, during which a presentation was made on the activities carried out in Uzbekistan to raise public awareness about the achievements of the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programmes.
All participants of the Regional Workshop agreed that the resulting regional collaboration and synergies enable the FTPP to function as a powerful support mechanism for achieving the SDGs, in particular Goal 1 “No Poverty” and Goal 2 “Zero Hunger”.
For reference: Building on Türkiye’s long-lasting partnership with FAO, the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programmes have had a transformative impact on agriculture, food and natural resources management, notably in beneficiary countries – in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Currently, the FTPP consists of two modules: the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture (FTPP II) and the FAO–Türkiye Forestry Partnership Programme (FTFP). FTPP II and FTFP together comprise 20 projects covering a wide array of topics including but not limited to fisheries, forestry, food security, food safety, food loss and waste, and rural women.

Title: UNICEF supports improvement of water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities in Karakalpakstan
Content: 22 December 2022
Today, UNICEF and the Ministry of Health of Karakalpakstan are conducting Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Project Sites Handover Ceremony in Kungrad district of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. 130,000 population, including 25,000 school children, will benefit from the improved WASH services in 10 healthcare facilities and 8 schools in the district. Also, WASH facilities were improved in Muynak and Bozataw districts.
Along with the WASH facilities, UNICEF piloted the first environment-friendly frictional heat machine with an integrated shredder to treat infectious medical waste and consumables in Karakalpakstan. These machines are innovative since they do not create hazardous carcinogenic toxins associated with burning medical waste. Additionally, the sterilized medical waste produced can be used as a base material for construction or added to domestic waste collection wastes for landfill disposal.
“To reduce the environmental impact of medical waste, UNICEF designed a comprehensive initiative on healthcare waste management system in the country by helping to align relevant policies and standard operating procedures with international standards and best practices," said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan.” Investments in effective and climate-friendly waste management will eliminate indirect and direct risk factors to human health and the environment,” he added.
It is expected that improved WASH services will contribute to providing better health services in healthcare facilities and create enabling education environment in schools. UNICEF applied innovative solutions for WASH facilities by installing solar panels, solar water heaters, reverse osmosis systems for clean drinking water and three-step septic tanks for safe management of sewage water, as well as steam wave health care waste management equipment.
UNICEF also trained over 400 healthcare workers on WASH and Infection Prevention and Control in healthcare facilities. Over 750 schoolteachers and 16,000 school children have undergone health sessions on WASH and nutrition topics.
“Our continued partnership with UNICEF is pivotal in improving the health of the population and children in Karakalpakstan. We significantly improved the mothers' and newborns' health in the region, and now we are investing in improving WASH infrastructure and Health Care Waste Management systems in healthcare facilities and schools,” said Mr. Murad Kurbanov, Minister of Health of the Republic of Karakalpakstan.
WASH infrastructure improvement intervention is a part of the UNICEF-led UN Joint Programme “Investing in a resilient future of Karakalpakstan by improving health, nutrition, water, sanitation, hygiene and wellbeing of adolescents and by harnessing the talents of youth during and after COVID- 19”. The joint programme is funded by UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea region in Uzbekistan with a budget of USD 3,550,273 for the period of January 2021- December 2022.

Title: FAO and Westminster International University in Tashkent launch Uzbekistan Food Price Monitoring and Analysis Tool
Content: 19 December 2022
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and Westminster International University in Tashkent (WIUT) launched Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) – a web-based tool to facilitate dissemination and analysis of food price data. The FPMA was launched according to the agreement between the FAO and WIUT on the “Technical implementation of the Price and market information system and related policy analysis for selected agricultural value chains in Uzbekistan” in a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan.


The FPMA Tool provides an easy way to access the large amounts of price data. It allows users to quickly browse single price series, create comparisons among countries/markets/commodities, download charts, data and basic statistics such as averages, standard deviations and percentage changes.
The global version of the tool was developed in 2010. Building on the success and experience gained through developing the Food Price Monitoring and Analysis Tool at global level, the tool has been adapted for use in Uzbekistan. The country level version of the price tool contains a broader selection of commodities and markets than what is available in the global level tool. WIUT is the first partner of FAO where the country level tool was successfully installed "on-premises".
The tool in Uzbekistan is available in three languages – Uzbek, English and Russian. As of today, the tool includes data on 77 food commodities from the dekhkan markets starting from January 2019. The tool is hosted and maintained by the Center of Policy Research and Outreach (CPRO) at WIUT. The Center collaborates with the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics and other national ministries and agencies on having access to data. The Center also started collecting data from a local retail market.
The tool will also support the Government of Uzbekistan in the implementation of the Agriculture Development Strategy for 2020-2030. Price and market information systems are important in agricultural development, especially for smallholders and food producers. Reliable price information will increase market transparency, competitiveness and ensure a more equitable distribution of income among the key players. A timely and reliable price information can promote the sustainable food value chain development and support agri-food systems transformation.

Title: Germany continues to address climate change’s impacts in Uzbekistan by supporting the Aral Sea Fund
Content: 16 December 2022
In the framework of its International Climate Initiative, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, a key contributor to climate-related United Nations Multi-Partner Trust Funds, has made a €700,000 contribution to the Aral Sea Fund (currently known as the Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region in Uzbekistan). As an earmarked allocation, the German contribution will serve to specifically support reducing stress on local communities caused by the deteriorating environmental situation, being the first outcome of the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region in Uzbekistan (MPHSTF) programmatic framework.
German Ambassador to Uzbekistan Dr. Tilo Klinner states that: “The people and government of the Federal Republic of Germany are pleased to offer financial support needed to address the most pressing concerns of communities tied to the Aral Sea. Advancements in this priority area will benefit not just Uzbekistan’s citizens, especially women and children, but also those of other Central Asian nations and will indeed have positive impacts on a global scale. The contribution to the Aral Sea Fund is furthermore an example of Germany´s new foreign climate policy, which puts climate-induced threats to human security at its center.”
The ecologically-sustainable economic development of the Aral Sea Region, through infrastructure development, innovation promotion and regional cooperation, is an outcome the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany supports as a means of addressing climate change impacts in Central Asia. Germany recognizes that the Aral Sea crisis has been an acute challenge in western Uzbekistan, with environmental and human ramifications beyond national and regional borders. The sea’s progressive shrinking has profoundly influenced its surrounding region’s environment, economy and ecology. A direct consequence of its drying out has been dramatic climate change felt not only in Central Asia but also far beyond.
By virtue of its contribution to the Aral Sea Fund, Germany has multiplied efforts of national and local development partners, participating UN Organizations, NGOs, CSOs and academia, in continuing to make positive changes in the lives of people of Aral Sea communities. Through joint programmes and with funding support from Germany alongside existing partners, development stakeholders in the Aral Sea Region can address food, economic, social, health and environmental challenges through the approach of ‘leaving no one behind’ - reaching vulnerable groups including children, youth, women, and the elderly.
The United Nations in Uzbekistan acknowledges the key support of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for achieving the Aral Sea Region’s sustainable development. Ms. Consuelo Vidal, the new United Nations Resident Coordinator, ad interim, for Uzbekistan welcomes the generous gesture of Germany and states that: “The UN Country Team in Uzbekistan is grateful for its continued partnership with the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. As I begin my tenure in Uzbekistan, I will seek to ensure this contribution benefits the people of Karakalpakstan through climate-related interventions. The UN family in Uzbekistan recognizes that as an earmarked contribution to a pooled fund, Germany’s support will be co-mingled with contributions from the governments of Uzbekistan, Norway, Finland, the Republic of Korea and the European Union, the Alwaleed Philanthropies, and future contributing partners, to achieve a greater impact for people affected by the Aral Sea crisis.”

Title: Partnerships Towards Achieving Universal Early Childhood Education in Uzbekistan
Content: 15 November 2022
On the sidelines of the World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education (WCECCE) in Tashkent, the Ministry of Preschool Education of Uzbekistan (MoPSE), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and World Bank (WB) are discussing lessons learned and further steps on how working in partnership can support Uzbekistan’s reform for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE).
“We expect that the conference will help increase investment in children under eight years of age, as well as set new benchmarks in their upbringing and education in a number of priority areas. Its main outcome should be the adoption of the Tashkent Declaration, which will outline the strategy for the development of preschool education in the world for the next decade,” said Agrippina Shin, Minister of Preschool Education.
The discussion follows significant progress recorded on Uzbekistan’s Early Childhood Education Agenda, which has seen a staggering increase in enrolment with the number of children (3-6 years) accessing ECE services increasing from 634,000 in 2015 to almost 2 million by 2022 – equivalent to over 39% increase of the national coverage in 5 years since the establishment of MoPSE.
The side-event, which is titled Partnerships Towards Achieving Universal Early Childhood Education in Uzbekistan, recognized the critical levers for Early Childhood Education Reform in Uzbekistan as decisive action at political level to drive reform backed by the allocation of additional resources and partnerships. Further, active involvement of private sector through public private partnership, innovative approaches and partnerships between government, UNICEF and World Bank have been highly influential enablers of a sustainable reform agenda.
The side event acknowledges that despite tremendous progress made, many children still need support in order to access early childhood learning before five years. According to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (2022) data, there are still equity issues related to disparities in attendance in ECE (3-4 years old) by gender (51% male and 41% female), urban 51% and rural 42%, and wealth quintile of households with 55% richest and 29% poorest.
UNICEF is advocating for a focus on transformative interventions to reach the last mile, which is often the biggest challenge for national education systems through the following:
“Uzbekistan tops global ranking of enrollment dynamics in preschool education which was possible due to the political will and smart investments backed by the science and economics, which are clearly on the side of entrusting resources into early childhood,” said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan. “Nonetheless, the agenda is incomplete, and we now know what works and the gaps, including on quality and inclusion, so let us galvanize the partners required to reach the last mile.”
“The World Bank welcomes the progress Uzbekistan has achieved since 2017 in expanding access to preschool education. With a young and rapidly growing population, the government should continue and accelerate its efforts to invest in early childhood education to help develop the emotional, social, and cognitive skills that children need to become lifelong to become lifelong learners,” noted Marco Mantovanelli, World Bank Country Manager for Uzbekistan. “A Bank-funded project (around US$ 74 million) is supporting the MoPSE in expanding access and improving the learning environment in urban and rural preschools. In partnership with the government and other international donors, these efforts will further increase children’s chances of a good start in their early years as a critical foundation for improved learning and productive lives in the future. The World Bank will continue to support Uzbekistan in implementing further educational reforms and investments under a new Country Partnership Framework for FY2022-2026.”

Title: FAO’s Global Action on One Country One Priority Product (OCOP) project launched in Uzbekistan
Content: 04 November 2022
This was officially confirmed at the Launch Event on the Country Projects for the Implementation of the FAO Global Action on Green Development of Special Agricultural Products: “One Country One Priority Product” (OCOP), held on 3 November 2022 at the Sheikh Zayed Center at FAO Headquarters in Rome, Italy.
The participation of Mr. Nuriddin Kushnazarov, Deputy Permanent Representative of Uzbekistan to FAO, IFAD and WFP at the event, where he made a presentation on “Green Development of Sweet Cherry in Uzbekistan”, symbolizes the attention and efforts of Uzbekistan towards the development of the agricultural sector and the achievement of food security.
In his presentation, Mr. Kushnazarov emphasized the importance of the agricultural sector for Uzbekistan and presented an evidence-based case for the selection of sweet cherries as one of the priority crops that needs technical assistance and capacity building support from FAO under the OCOP Initiative.
The Global Action on One Country One Priority Product (OCOP) aims to build more sustainable food value chains, support family and smallholder farmers to be profitable and improve their livelihoods, minimize the use of chemical inputs and natural resources, reduce food loss and waste, and limit the negative impacts on the environment.
Altogether 78 nations from five FAO regions have been designated as potential project countries, planning to promote 50 Special Agricultural Products (SAPs), under OCOP, which was launched by FAO last year.
The SAPs, covering all kinds of agricultural products, are locally known, available, or underutilized and have the potential to be promoted in national, regional and international markets.  “They include field and horticulture crops as well as forest and livestock products, they are locally known and unique to the specific agroecological regions, play a significant role in achieving food security and nutrition and have the potential to be promoted in local, regional and international markets,” - FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said in his remarks at the launch event.
Unique business model will help smallholders
The OCOP’s unique business model aims to help smallholder farmers increase their food production in a sustainable way, generates higher incomes and improves livelihoods, placing farmers and their communities at the center.
The first phase, expected to start in January 2023, will aim to include a large part of the applications received from the 78 countries. These will include mainly SAPs based on field and horticulture crops, reflecting the type of submissions made, but not fully restricted to these.
The second phase will cover the remaining countries (and potential new ones), draw on experience gained with the OCOP, and would start in July 2023.
The first-round demonstration project countries identified for implementation of OCOP are: Bangladesh, representing the Asia and the Pacific Region, which will promote jackfruit; Egypt, representing the Near East and North Africa Region, which will promote date palm; Malawi, representing the African Region, which will promote banana; Trinidad and Tobago, representing the Latin American and the Caribbean Region, which will promote cocoa; and Uzbekistan, representing the Europe and Central Asia Region, which will promote sweet cherry.
These five demonstration project countries for implementation of OCOP will share and disseminate their experiences, innovations and technologies during the development of their SAPs. A dedicated FAO global OCOP website was also launched and will be a useful platform to share information and lessons learned during implementation.
Coordination to address challenges
The OCOP country projects will coordinate financial, technical and human resources to address the main challenges identified for SAPs, and support farmers and other stakeholders to further develop the value chain.
The OCOP will focus its efforts on products from drylands, which represent over 43 percent of the world's total land area, and are home to an estimated 2 billion people, of whom around 90 percent are in developing countries; the tropics, which constitute 40 percent of the Earth's surface and are home to over 40 percent of the world's population, and mountains, which cover 25 percent of the world's land surface, and directly support 12 percent of the world's population.

Title: Uzbekistan and IFAD renew strategic partnership to address global challenges including food supply
Content: 26 October 2022
Amid global threats including climate change, increasing food and input costs and rising poverty, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Government of Uzbekistan have extended their successful cooperation to continue to support the country in meeting its rural development goals. In this regard, a new Country Strategic Opportunities Programme (COSOP) for 2023 - 2027 was endorsed today during a high-level event in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in the presence of government officials, IFAD managers and farmers’ representatives.
Over the next five years, IFAD and the Government of Uzbekistan commit to investing in the resilience and productivity of 205,000 rural households, representing 1.2 million rural people, small-scale producers, women and youth. In a regional context of compounding crises, IFAD’s support will focus on improving access to competitive agricultural markets for farmers, scaling up innovation and strengthening resilience to climate change.
“IFAD will deploy the full breadth of the Fund’s enhanced business model to help advance Uzbekistan’s inclusive and sustainable food systems transformation for the benefit of the country’s rural population,” said Fidy Rajaonson, IFAD’s Country Director. With a programme of work exceeding USD 600 million, including IFAD resources and co-financing, the 2023 – 2027 COSOP will leverage partnership and development coordination to deliver transformative investment programmes, evidence-based policy support and private sector engagement for job creation.
The compounding effect of COVID-19, neighbouring conflict and climate change is affecting the livelihood of smallholder farmers and producers in Uzbekistan. This makes this 5-year strategy very timely for the most vulnerable communities in need of support.
“This new partnership framework with IFAD will make a significant contribution to helping Uzbekistan realize its vision of increasing the population’s prosperity, doubling farmers’ income by 2026 and becoming an upper-middle income country,” said Aziz Voitov, Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
The COSOP will invest in climate-smart agriculture and sustainable land management approaches that improve productivity. To address inequality, the country programme will take action to ensure that female representation is enhanced. Youth will represent 30 per cent of direct beneficiaries, with a focus on rural entrepreneurship and equal access to digital technology. The COSOP also addresses food insecurity and malnutrition through increased production of fresh produce, adoption of improved health standards and application of internationally recognized standards for production systems.
Agriculture represents nearly 30 per cent of Uzbekistan’s GDP, the highest in the Europe and Central Asia region. Half of all Uzbeks, and 75 per cent of the country’s low-income population, live in rural areas. As of 2021, small-scale producers and dehkan farmers (small household plots) numbered 5.5 million rural people – of these, IFAD has empowered some 99,000 households to create value in the horticulture and dairy sub-sectors.
Since Uzbekistan became a member of IFAD in 2011, IFAD has supported three investment projects for a total cost of US$435 million, of which US$129 million was IFAD financing.

Title: UNESCO World Conference to urge for higher investment in decisive years of early childhood care and education
Content: 24 October 2022
Despite strong evidence showing the benefits of early childhood care and education, new UNESCO data shows that 1 out of 4 children aged 5 have never had any form of pre-primary education. This represents 35 million out of 137 million 5-year-old children worldwide. Globally, only half of all countries guarantee free pre-primary education.
On 14-16 November, UNESCO’s World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education taking place in Tashkent, Uzbekistan will reaffirm every young child’s right to quality care and education, and push for increased investment in children during the period from birth to eight years.
“Investing in early education is the most transformative investment a country can make to give all children a fair start in life and combat inequalities early on,” says UNESCO Director- General Audrey Azoulay. "It is critical to lay the foundation preparing children for primary education and enabling them to thrive through lifelong learning.”
Hosted by the Government of Uzbekistan, the conference will bring together over 1000 people, including Heads of State and Government and ministers, as well as participants from civil society, intergovernmental organizations, the private sector, teacher and parent associations, and academia. A declaration of commitment to expand inclusive access to quality early childhood care and education by 2030 and beyond is expected to be adopted.
The Conference aims to galvanize political commitments for radical change and to new benchmarks to care for and educate society's youngest, on four thematic priorities: (1) inclusion, quality, and well-being, (2) educators, teachers, and caregivers, (3) innovations, (4) policy, governance, and finance.
Educational inequalities start in early childhood
During this period, the brain develops at its fastest rate. The conditions a young child experiences will influence his or her long-term cognitive, social, and emotional development. Educational inequalities start in the early years and persist throughout life.
The most recent data indicates that globally, six out of every ten children are unable to read and understand a simple text by the age of ten. Providing equal opportunities early and for all young children, through access to quality early childhood care and education, is the critical first step to eliminating entrenched disparities in education outcomes and livelihoods. In addition, early sensitization and awareness of climate change, global citizenship, gender equality, and living together are critical to achieving sustainable development, peace, and prosperity.
The World Conference follows the recent UN Transforming Education Summit, which called for prioritizing foundational learning to enable all children to reach their full potential and participate in society.

Title: Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction, Islamic Development Bank, OPEC Fund and UNDP joined their efforts to promote Sustainable Rural Development in Uzbekistan
Content: 19 October 2022
Yesterday marked the 30th anniversary of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, a day set aside each year since 1992 to acknowledge the effort and struggle of people living in poverty, a chance for them to make their concerns heard, and to recognize that poor people are the first ones to fight against poverty. Every year on this day, the United Nations invites all countries to devote the Day to presenting and promoting concrete activities to eradicate poverty and destitution.
In Uzbekistan, the United Nations Development Programme, the Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), and the OPEC Fund for International Development took the chance to start a new project called "Sustainable Rural Development in the Republic of Uzbekistan."
Speaking at the launch, Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan, said the new initiative is in line with and supports the Government’s Development Strategy 2022-2026. "The broader perspective at the core of this project is to address human development deficits in rural areas of Uzbekistan and to propose new solutions to build shared prosperity," she said. "UNDP is pleased to be part of this great initiative and to take responsibility to ensure the resources are used in the best way possible to help people."
Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, innovation, and sound infrastructure are the cornerstones of the country's development process. An important factor in improving people's well-being is their active participation in shaping priority areas to meet the needs and demands in their communities. According to the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics for 2021, 17 percent of the population lives below the poverty level. The Government has set a goal to reduce poverty in the country by half by the end of 2026 as part of its Development Strategy.
The primary goal of the "Sustainable Rural Development" project is to create favourable living conditions for rural residents and ensure their access to basic infrastructure, health and education services. It aims to improve the quality of life for people living in rural areas by improving road and transportation infrastructure, engineering and communication networks, power supply systems, and the use of resource-saving and environmentally friendly technologies in the building and rebuilding of social facilities like kindergartens, public education schools, and rural clinics. This will be done by strengthening local government processes based on broad public participation in target regions.
In particular, the project envisages the construction and overhaul of social and infrastructure facilities in 170 makhalla communities in 20 districts of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, Navoi, Khorezm, Bukhara, and Navoi oblasts. Also, 66 community Development plans for communities will be developed by the end of the year.
The total amount for the project allocated by donors is USD 338 million for the period of 2022-2025.
UNDP will support the Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction to implement one component of the IsDB project: "Engineering Services and Strengthening Capacity Infrastructure in Management," whose objectives are: 1) Strengthening the capacity of local communities to identify and represent their interests and needs; 2) Training representatives of local architectural and design institutes and regional construction departments; 3) Capacity building of the construction sector and architectural design to implement innovative IT solutions and digital transformation from a gender perspective; and 4) Involving local communities in decision-making processes.
UNDP remains committed to achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals in Uzbekistan. This initiative contributes directly to Goal 9: "Building resilient infrastructure and promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation" by providing comprehensive poverty eradication assistance in parallel with efforts to increase economic growth and address a range of issues in education, health, social protection, and employment, as well as climate change and environmental protection.
The Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Minister of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Jamshid Kuchkarov, Head of the Regional Hub in Almaty of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) Ibrahim Ali Shukri, Regional Manager of MENA, Eastern Europe and Central Asia Region of OPEC Fund for International Development Olga Mikhailova, and UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan Matilda Dimovska all made welcome remarks at the event. Furthermore, IsDB PIU and UNDP made presentations on the project’s realization and further plans for its implementation.
This project is a good opportunity for the rural population to get access to basic social services and improve the living conditions of rural people.

Title: On International Day of the Girl UNICEF and Partners Call for Investments and Empowerment of Girls
Content: 11 October 2022
On the 10th Anniversary of the International Day of the Girl (IDG), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and partners have called for heightened investment in girls’ leadership and empowerment through building the skills in Science Technology Engineering & Mathematic (STEM).
In Uzbekistan and across Central Asia, girls continue to be underrepresented or entirely left out on essential learning opportunities in STEM and ICT fields due to harmful norms and gendered expectations of girls as caregivers – and gender stereotypes are perpetuated through generations.
“Investing in reducing the gender gap in STEM and promoting girls’ leadership and empowerment is imperative,” said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan. “Closing the gender gap in digital fluency expands possibilities for girls in a technology driven world. Girls learn the skills needed to participate in the digital economy, improve financial agency and self-sufficiency and will ultimately enhance human capital and contribute to the growth and development of Uzbekistan.”
In Uzbekistan, girls and young women are prevailing among Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET), which makes them more vulnerable to becoming socially excluded. After completion of the compulsory secondary education 56% of young people of 19-24 years of age are NEET (69% female and 33.4% male). The NEET-rate for young women increases rapidly once they are above 18 years of age and complete compulsory secondary education (from 1.7% to 69%).
Further, a substantial divide persists among girls and boys in computer literacy and Internet access and use. The share of females without any computer literacy is 43.5% in comparison with the one among males of 30,0%. The share of girls and young women aged 14-30 years old who never use the Internet is 68%. The key reasons of not using the Internet among youth are poor connectivity, lack of own devices and high cost of the Internet. For girls and young women, the access is also hindered by social stigmatization. Underrepresentation of young women in STEM fields reduces their skilled employment prospects.
Girls with disabilities are especially at risk of not getting an education and training and do not have minimum digital literacy to navigate safely on digital platforms, limiting future educational and employment opportunities. The NEET rate among young people with severe disabilities is 77%, rising to 91% among those with profound disabilities.
In Uzbekistan, UNICEF jointly with IT PARK is implementing a free comprehensive digital literacy and graphic design training program at IT centers in Karshi, Termez, Nukus and Tashkent to enhance girls’ leadership and empowerment in STEM fields.
Participants also include girls with visual, hearing and physical disabilities. In addition to giving girls and young women critical technology skills, the programme is equipping girls on concepts of gender equality and disability inclusion and how harmful gender stereotypes impact girls’ choices in life.
Research has shown that visible, relatable women role models in STEM can have profound influence on girls’ decisions to engage and pursue education and careers in these fields, so the programme is  also linking girls to role models in the field of high technologies.
UNICEF has identified the following as critical pillars for the empowerment of girls in Uzbekistan and beyond:

Title: Government of Uzbekistan and UNHCR airlift aid for thousands affected by catastrophic floods in Pakistan
Content: 29 September 2022
The Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, have sent their first-ever joint airlift of humanitarian assistance from Termez, destined for Karachi, Pakistan to help thousands affected by the recent catastrophic flooding.
With an aircraft provided by the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the airlift contains over 15,000kgs of UNHCR ‘Refugee Housing Units’ to provide temporary shelter to those whose homes have been destroyed by the floods.
UNHCR and Uzbekistan continue to support the relief efforts in flood-hit parts of Pakistan, where the situation remains dire. Some 7.6 million people have been displaced by the floods, according to the latest estimates, with nearly 600,000 living in relief sites. Officials warn that it could take up to six months for flood waters to recede in the hardest-hit areas.
The relief items had been prepositioned in the UNHCR Regional Humanitarian Logistics Hub, established within the Termez Cargo Centre in 2021 with the support of the Government of Uzbekistan. The UNHCR office in Pakistan will receive and distribute the supplies arriving from Uzbekistan.
“We greatly appreciate the support of the Government of Uzbekistan to enable UNHCR to provide quick humanitarian assistance when it is needed most,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia.
Over 100 trucks of core relief items have already been dispatched from the regional hub in Termez to assist the Pakistan flood response, complemented by today’s airlift, courtesy of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
The UNHCR Regional Humanitarian Logistics Hub is part of UNHCR’s overall emergency preparedness and response strategy for the region. In addition to storing a contingency stockpile of core relief items, the Termez hub also serves as the main consolidation and transfer point to deliver material humanitarian assistance to UNHCR’s operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Central Asia and beyond.
In June 2022, the President of Uzbekistan granted the Termez Cargo Centre the status of ‘International Multifunctional Transport and Logistics Hub for humanitarian assistance’.
UNHCR continues to coordinate logistics as part of a plan to transport over 1.2 million relief items to local authorities in the most flood-affected areas. So far, UNHCR has delivered over 1 million life-saving items to authorities for distribution. In addition to this flight from Uzbekistan, UNHCR has carried out 22 humanitarian airlifts from Dubai.

Title: Forum on Championing Business Sustainability in Uzbekistan
Content: 27 September 2022
The United Nations in Uzbekistan in close cooperation with the United Nations Global Compact and the founding members of the UN's Coalition on Business Champions for Sustainable Development, namely “Korzinka” supermarkets chain, Silverleafe, and Artel Electronics held a Forum on Championing Business Sustainability in Uzbekistan. The American Chamber of Commerce in Uzbekistan was an information partner of the event.
The Forum played an instrumental role in introducing the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices, sustainability principles, and UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) integration to the private sector in Uzbekistan.
The Resident Coordinator of United Nations, Ms. Roli Asthana in her address highlighted the vital role of the private sector in achieving the SDGs through transitioning to and promoting sustainable business practices. The ensuing discussions brough together the government, private sector, international organizations, as well as experts from the UN Global Compact Local Networks of Türkiye, Georgia, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
Attendees also heard from representatives of Uzbekistan’s first participants of the UN Global Compact: Mr. Zafar Khashimov, Founder of “Korzinka” supermarket chain; Bektemir Murodov, CFO of Artel Electronics, and Dan Patterson, General Director of Silverleafe. These three companies are also the founding members of UN's Coalition on Business Champions for Sustainable Development. In joining the UN Global Compact, they have committed to promote the UN Global Compact’s ten principles, on labor, human rights and environmental protection.
The Forum was designed to engage the Uzbek private sector further in introducing ESG practices. Panels addressed sustainable practices in human rights and labor conditions, environment, and business modernization as well as highlighted case studies and best practice that can be of practical use to companies as they start on their sustainability journey.
The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact
Corporate sustainability starts with a company’s value system and a principles-based approach to doing business. This means operating in ways that, at a minimum, meet fundamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. Responsible businesses enact the same values and principles wherever they have a presence and know that good practices in one area do not offset harm in another. By incorporating the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact into strategies, policies, and procedures, and establishing a culture of integrity, companies are not only upholding their basic responsibilities to people and planet, but also setting the stage for long-term success.
The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact are derived from: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.
The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have a different but deeply related purpose for business. As the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Global Goals demonstrate the scale and ambition of the boldest vision for humanity ever adopted. They represent aspirational, long-term targets for governments, business and other stakeholders to work towards creating the world we want. Together, the Ten Principles and the SDGs equip business with both the values and vision to help companies make a meaningful contribution to people and the planet.
The United Nations in Uzbekistan
Uzbekistan joined the United Nations on 2 March 1992 as a new sovereign and independent state. The United Nations Office opened in Tashkent the following year. The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Uzbekistan currently comprises 25 UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes working together to advance national development priorities in line with Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.
In September 2020, the UN Country Team finalized the next generation UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (2021-2025), which was endorsed and signed by the Government of Uzbekistan. The Cooperation Framework articulates the UN’s collective response to supporting Uzbekistan to achieve the national SDGs with an emphasis on leaving no one behind. The Cooperation Framework is the primary instrument for planning and implementation of all UN development activities in the country, in support of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. It was developed in close consultation with the Government, the Parliament and civil society in Uzbekistan and has three strategic objectives:
About the UN Global Compact
The UN Global Compact is a call to companies everywhere to align their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, and to act in support of UN goals and issues embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Launched in 2000, the United Nations Global Compact is both a policy platform and a practical framework for companies that are committed to sustainability and responsible business practices. It is the largest corporate sustainability initiative globally, with over 16,000 companies and 3,000 non-business participants based in over 160 countries and more than 70 Local Networks.

Title: IAEA, WHO and IARC Conduct Assessment to Inform Further Investments in Cancer Care in Uzbekistan
Content: 26 September 2022
Uzbekistan has made substantive progress in the expansion of access to, and quality of, cancer care services, an IAEA-WHO-IARC-led team concluded this month, following an imPACT Review.
In the years since the conclusion of a 2014 review mission, the number of functioning external beam radiotherapy machines in Uzbekistan has grown from five machines in four cancer care institutions to 19 in 15 institutions in 2022.
In 2020, more than 20 000 new cancer cases were registered in Uzbekistan, an annual figure which is expected to nearly double by 2040, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). In its efforts to address the growing cancer burden, the Government of Uzbekistan invited experts from the IAEA, WHO and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to assess its national capacities in cancer control and to provide corresponding recommendations to strengthen their national cancer infrastructure and workforce.
Comprising international and national cancer specialists, the team provided actionable guidance to expand and enhance cancer care in Uzbekistan—particularly in the areas of breast, cervical and childhood cancers—by scaling up prevention and early diagnosis services, improving quality and access to treatment, and by guiding the development of  a new national cancer control programme (NCCP) and further investments in cancer control.
Following in-country visits to key facilities and discussions with the main stakeholders and service providers, the imPACT Review equips national decision-makers with baseline data and analysis on cancer control capacities in their country.
“This imPACT review also included an in-depth analysis of infrastructure, equipment and workforce needs in the main cancer care hospitals in the country,” said Christoph Henrich, the Programme Management Officer of the IAEA’s technical cooperation programme in Uzbekistan. “This information is now being used to define corresponding equipment and human resource capacity building activities for upcoming oncology projects for the country.”
National Cancer Control Planning
One of the main priorities of Uzbekistan is to formulate a comprehensive cancer control strategy in the context of available resources. Responding to this need, the IAEA, WHO and IARC can support national, evidence-based planning for the introduction of the most effective cancer control interventions, across the entire cancer control spectrum, from cancer prevention and early diagnosis to treatment and palliation.
“Without careful planning and evidence-based strategies, there is a risk that resources available for cancer control will be used inefficiently or inequitably,” said Lisa Stevens, Director of the IAEA Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT). “By supporting the development of comprehensive, data-driven NCCPs, we can help countries achieve a substantial degree of cancer control even where resources are severely limited.”
As part of the imPACT Review, Uzbekistan received technical advice from the IAEA, WHO and IARC to align the development of their new NCCP with key national health policies and country-specific cancer burden, existing health infrastructure, available resources as well as the socioeconomic context of Uzbekistan.
“The Ministry of Health appreciates the long-term partnership with the IAEA, WHO and IARC, working together to improve the capacity of the health system in responding to cancer burden. We very much value the recommendations from the imPACT Review as they will guide us in ensuring health care in Uzbekistan is provided according to internationally recognized standards,” said Uzbekistan’s Deputy Minister of Health, Elmira Basithanova. “Our objective is to strengthen early detection and treatment services for the most prevalent cancers in the country, such as cervical, breast, colorectal and childhood cancers. Using the expertise from the three agencies, we will continue our collaboration in the future and work together towards formulating the new national cancer plan of Uzbekistan based on the recent mission findings.”
The road ahead
For Uzbekistan, and other countries working on strengthening comprehensive cancer care capabilities, there are options for international support, funding and partnerships. The IAEA is committed to being part of this support. On World Cancer Day 2022, the IAEA launched the Rays of Hope initiative to assist low- and middle-income countries to increase access to radiotherapy.
To address the growing need for funds and to maximize the impact of the Rays of Hope initiative, the IAEA is working closely with the Islamic Development Bank to coordinate funding for equipment, training and education through a partnership agreement signed in 2019.
Within the framework of this partnership, a project with Uzbekistan was launched. Through this, the IAEA provides technical advice to the Government of Uzbekistan in the implementation of the initiative to increase access to cancer care. The latest imPACT Review will further guide the planning and implementation of this Uzbekistan-IsDB project.

Title: FAO and UNECE work together to restore forests in Uzbekistan
Content: 21 September 2022
On 20-21 September the State Committee on Forestry of Uzbekistan with support of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has organized the national forest policy dialogue “Forestry Sector Feasibility Study Towards Resilient Landscapes Restoration in Uzbekistan.”
The dialogue brought together experts from state ministries and agencies, civil society, academia, research institutions and international organisations to review the enabling environment (policy, legal and institutional frameworks) for the forestry sector, the finance mechanisms and financial sustainability of the forest landscape restoration works in the country.
As mentioned during the dialogue, in 2018, the Government of Uzbekistan pledged to restore over 500,000 ha of degraded landscapes under the Bonn Challenge. The Bonn Challenge is a global goal to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. To date, 61 countries, 8 states and 5 associations have accepted the Bonn Challenge.
The participants of the dialogue emphasized Uzbekistan’s efforts within the framework of the nationwide project "Yashil Makon" (Green Space), initiated by the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev in 2021. This nation-wide afforestation programme was added to the Strategy for Developing the New Uzbekistan during 2022-2026 and envisages expansion of forest cover area in the country by planting 200 million trees annually. The "Yashil Makon" project foresees a comprehensive scheme of greening efforts with engagement of various public agencies and research communities.
The National Forest Policy Dialogue in Tashkent was organized as part of UNECE/FAO Integrated Programme of Work 2022-2025.

Title: FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry partner to transform the lives of rural women in Türkiye and Central Asia
Content: 22 August 2022
The three-year project, “Leaving No One Behind: Greater Involvement and Empowerment of Rural Women in Türkiye and Central Asia”, aims to improve the socio-economic status of rural women by supporting inclusive agricultural and forestry policies and programmes in Türkiye, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
The first regional workshop for the project “Leaving No One Behind: Greater Involvement and Empowerment of Rural Women in Türkiye and Central Asia”, was held on 3 August in Ankara, within the framework of the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture. The project will work towards eliminating gender-based discrimination and exclusion in rural areas of Türkiye, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by providing learning and income-generation opportunities and promoting inclusion. In Türkiye, the project will support the establishment of pilots in at least three provinces, while in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the focus will be on building knowledge and strengthening the capacities of decision-makers to formulate and implement policies and projects based on evidence and sound gender analysis. The project will bring together beneficiaries from all three countries to share best practices and lessons learned about socially inclusive agri-food systems and women’s empowerment in rural areas.
The inception workshop was the first step in this process. Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Türkiye and ministries of agriculture of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, FAO, experts, development practitioners, civil society members and other stakeholders met to discuss the project’s concept, approach and planned activities, reach a consensus and commence implementation.
Evidence generated by FAO across the globe points to a strong correlation between gender inequalities, poverty and poor performance in agricultural sectors. Improving gender equality by expanding economic opportunities for women has multiple positive impacts for women, men, and their families and communities. Emphasizing the systemic barriers that women, and especially rural women, face in access to resources, education and employment opportunities, Viorel Gutu, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Central Asia and FAO Representative in Türkiye, affirmed that FAO is “committed to supporting rural women’s access to knowledge and skills”, and notied that “we also provide policy advice to institutions involved in formulating and implementing agriculture and rural development policies to help them be more responsive to the needs of the disadvantaged groups.”
Nimet Kaleli, Head of the Extension and Publication Department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and National Project Coordinator, explained that women in Türkiye and worldwide lead agricultural production while providing for their families and communities, and that women’s empowerment will therefore play a crucial role in poverty reduction. Kaleli also added that “Women across the globe have proven that, whenever the right opportunity, necessary means and support are given, they are capable of taking the lead in socio-economic development processes for their communities.” Nimet Kaleli emphasized that the project aims to develop an important model for eliminating gender-based discrimination and exclusion. She explained: “In three pilot districts in Türkiye, we aim to empower rural women who produce, process, join forces through local organizations such as women’s cooperatives, and market their branded production through local value chains. In this sense, our partnership with FAO represents a unique opportunity for countries worldwide who intend to create an inclusive agricultural eco-system where women drive and lead the change in sustainable development.”
Participants from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan joined the workshop online. Jabbor Nosirzoda, Deputy Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Tajikistan, underlined the importance of the project for Tajikistan where around 60 percent of workers in the food and agriculture sector are women. “However, the important role that women play remains to be recognized and women face systemic barriers, discrimination and exclusion, when compared to men”, he added. The Deputy Minister for Agriculture also expressed his confidence that overcoming rural women’s exclusion in rural areas, while providing them with equal opportunities to improve their livelihoods, will contribute to overall food security.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan was represented by Nabira Djumaeva, Deputy Head of the Department of the National Centre for Knowledge and Innovation in Agriculture. Djumaeva expressed her appreciation for FAO’s leading role and expertise in promoting gender equality in rural communities and was confident that providing equal economic opportunities to rural women will also help the world achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Inception Workshop also provided an opportunity for the FAO project team to meet with the representatives of provincial directorates to discuss first steps for practical implementation of the initiative.
About the “Leaving No One Behind: Greater Involvement and Empowerment of Rural Women in Türkiye and Central Asia” project
The project is funded by the Government of Türkiye. The overall objective is to provide policy support, capacity development and knowledge generation in order to accelerate gender equality and rural women’s economic empowerment, reduce rural poverty, and empower rural communities and organizations to access productive resources, services and markets.
The project will focus on the capacity development of key stakeholders to help them better understand the concepts of gender mainstreaming. It will address rural women directly by selecting value chains in the pilot areas of Türkiye, and bring together ministries of agriculture by providing a regional space to share policy solutions, best practices and challenges related to implementing agriculture and rural development policies and programmes that are gender responsive and meet the needs of disadvantaged groups among the rural population.
Furthermore, the project aims to improve rural women’s access to economic opportunities, and thus, improve their livelihoods as well as the livelihoods of their families.
About the FAO-Türkiye Partnership Programmes
The objectives of the FAO-Türkiye Partnership Programmes are to provide support to ensure food security, rural poverty reduction and sustainable forest management; combat desertification; and to preserve ecosystems in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and other countries of mutual interest.

Title: Migrant chef, migrant hero dies in Ukraine
Content: 04 August 2022
There are big heroes, who wish to stay invisible.
There are dedicated professionals, who deliver professionally.
There are brave humans, who burn themselves like a candle trying to bring some light into the midst of a night, to share some love and care.
And there are migrants, who are invisible heroes and brave humans, whose story needs to be told.
Sardor Hakimov (36), a professional cook, is one of them. He and his team of volunteers were preparing yet another pot of free Uzbek pilaf for displaced Ukrainians in the city of Chuhuiv in Eastern Ukraine, when rocket-shelling killed him last week.
Sardor, originally from the Farghona Valley of Uzbekistan, came to Ukraine as a migrant in 2000 when he was just 15. He dedicated himself to cooking and his traditional Uzbek pilaf became wildly popular. He opened his first restaurant  in Sievierodonetsk and another in Chuhuiv.
After the Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, Sardor sent his spouse and children to his native town in Uzbekistan, but stayed himself to continue cooking and serving the people, whom he knew for over 20 years. He brought together 15 volunteers and cooked pilaf to feed the displaced. His body was found under the rubble of the Palace of Culture, when he had set up the feeding station.
“Everyone in Chuhuiv knew him. Till the very last moment, the people in Chuhuiv had hoped that Sardor Hakimov would survive. He used to smile always, he was a very positive person”, said an official in Kharkiv, paying tribute.
His friends tell heart-touching stories of Sardor who enjoyed being able to help his community.
Sardor fell as a victim of the brutal war, but his pilaf, and the meaning behind it, remains, warming hearts and bringing hope for a brighter future.
His spouse and small kids must be proud of their hero husband, hero father.
Rest in peace, Sardor.

Title: FAO and partners discuss food loss and waste reduction in Uzbekistan
Content: 01 July 2022
About a third of all the food produced for human consumption each year is lost or wasted. In developing countries, 40 percent of food is wasted at the harvest or processing stage (food loss). In developed countries, the same percentage is lost at the stage of consumption or retail sale (food waste). At the same time, more than three billion people are malnourished or cannot afford healthy food. Everyone can contribute to change this situation.
These issues were discussed at the national validation workshop on “Formulation of a Strategic roadmap for Food Loss and Waste Reduction in Uzbekistan”, organized on June 30 in Tashkent by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
The agenda of the workshop included analysis of legislation and policies related to food loss and waste management in Uzbekistan and presentation of the results of the inception and field missions.
“Adoption of the strategy will contribute to improvement of national food system sustainability in Uzbekistan as well as in ensuring better food security and will open up new business opportunities. Moreover, reducing food loss and waste is an important target of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the 2030 Agenda”, - said Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan.
The workshop was held within the framework of the FAO project “Reduction of Food Loss and Waste in Central Asia, Azerbaijan and Turkey”, implemented as part of the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture (FTPP II). The project aims to assist Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in developing measures to reduce food loss and waste, covering all sub-sectors of the food system from farmers to consumers.
The main project beneficiaries are trainers, extension specialists and other staff of national institutions, government, non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations, as well as farmer/fisher organizations and other food value chain actors.

Title: UNDP and UNECE step forward to support Yashil Makon/Green Nation Initiative
Content: 22 June 2022
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Uzbekistan, the State Committee for Ecology and Environmental Protection (SCEEP) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) are initiating a new joint project entitled “Master Planning and Innovative Financial Solutions to Support the Yashil Makon Initiative of the Republic of Uzbekistan”.
The main purpose of the project is to support the Government of Uzbekistan in ensuring the sustainability and climate resilience of the initiative through innovative long-term financing, coordination and capacity building. The project will be co-funded by all three parties and implemented in close partnership with relevant national partners including the Ministry of Finance, the State Forestry Committee, Uzhydromet, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Mahalla and Family support and civil society organizations.
In this regard, the signing ceremony of the Statement of Intent was held on 22 June at the premises of the State Committee for Ecology and Environmental Protection. Marina Walter, UNDP Deputy Regional Director for Europe and the CIS, took part in the ceremony. “The Yashil Makon Initiative will help fulfill the country’s commitments under the Paris Agreement to mitigate climate change and adapt to climate impacts. In some parts of the country, the trees will improve soil quality and may help avoid or even reverse desertification. Dust storms are a significant hazard and addressing them will require strong partnerships and cooperation at national and international levels”, she noted in her remarks. “This initiative is already progressing and we at UNDP are committed to further support it by helping mobilize long-term financial investments to achieve the desired outcomes”, she added.
The joint project will be structured around the achievement of two interrelated and integrated key activity results, which reinforce each other:
Financing instruments proposed by UNDP will pave the country’s way to voluntary carbon trading markets and to the carbon offset generated through afforestation while also reducing the financial burden associated with afforestation work.
The project will contribute to creating green and sustainable jobs, especially for the rural women of Uzbekistan.
Background: Uzbekistan faces major challenges caused by climate change including desertification, water scarcity, frequent draughts, and shrinkage of the Aral Sea. Climate risks are exacerbated in the country by both the average temperatures rising and mountain glaciers, a vital source of drinking water, melting at a faster pace than the global averages. While forests account for only 7.7 percent (much lower than the global average) of the country’s territory, according to FAO they are vital for reversing desertification, protecting biodiversity and landscapes.
To combat the negative impact posed by climate change, the Government of Uzbekistan has put forward an afforestation initiative, called Yashil Makon/Green Nation in November 2021. This nation-wide afforestation program was added to the Strategy for Developing the New Uzbekistan during 2022-2026 and envisages expansion of forest coverage area in the country by planting 200 million trees annually.

Title: UNICEF calls for an end to violence against Women and Children in Uzbekistan
Content: 21 June 2022
UNICEF today cautioned against tolerating violence against children and women and called for a change in the societies’ attitudes towards these kinds of cases and emphasized the need for improved family support services and effective systems to protect victims of violence.
Following circulating multiple social media videos showing violence against women and children in Uzbekistan, UNICEF has expressed concerns about such incidences which seem commonplace: some incidents, including cases involving infants, occur in public and in the presence of onlookers.
“Women and children, especially girls, suffer violence every day, unfortunately, this is viewed as acceptable, normal, permissible and a ‘family matter’. Cases of violence can be prevented,” said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF representative in Uzbekistan. "Everyone has a role to play in ending violence; It is necessary to change people's attitudes towards violence, to stop impunity, to promote norms and positive practices and to provide qualified assistance to victims."
Globally, one in four children faces violence, while every five minutes a child dies because of its different forms. Early detection of cases, setting up hotlines to referral services and school activities are proven effective interventions that help fight violence. A referral system is an important entry point for the child protection system strengthening and should set out clearly defined roles and responsibilities of specialists in education, health, social protection, and justice sectors to prevent, identify and respond to violence against children.
Currently, in Uzbekistan, UNICEF is supporting government efforts to prevent and respond to violence. For instance, as a result of the joint work of UNICEF and the Ministry of Health 50 000 patronage nurses across the country have been equipped with skills and materials for home visits, which among other activities support parenting and identifying victims of neglect and physical violence.
UNICEF is also cooperating with the new Child Protection Sector of the Secretariat on Education and Health Issues under the Cabinet of Ministers, National Commission on Children’s issues, and Child Ombudsperson on establishing standard operating procedures to identify and respond to violence against children Further, UNICEF is supporting the country to roll-out a case management system, that enables a holistic picture of family needs, identifying the risks and linking families with other services to provide comprehensive support to the family.
In addition to all the measures taken, it is necessary to create an institution of social workers and mobilize the entire society for a systematic solution to this problem.

Title: NHRC and UNHCR facilitate discussion on interim arrangements for persons in need of international protection in Uzbekistan
Content: 06 June 2022
Today, the National Human Rights Centre of the Republic of Uzbekistan (NHRC) jointly with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency conducted a roundtable on interim arrangements and referral mechanisms for persons in need of international protection in Uzbekistan.
The goal of the roundtable was to discuss solutions for forcibly displaced persons that will allow them to get access to rights guaranteed by international and national law and humanitarian considerations. The event brought together representatives of Ministries, the General Prosecutor’s Office, the National Security Service, other state agencies and international organizations.
Uzbekistan has a long history of protecting people forced to flee their countries, escaping wars or persecution. With developments in Afghanistan, many Afghans had to leave their home seeking safety in neighboring countries, including Uzbekistan.

“I commend the people and Government of Uzbekistan for their generous support to Afghans, both humanitarian support across the border and to those who are in Uzbekistan unable to return home. This work embodies the Humanitarian-Peace-Development Nexus that is the core of the work of the UN. The UN stands ready to support the Government in all support efforts in line with international law," said Roli Asthana, UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan.
At the roundtable key aspects to be covered by interim arrangements in accordance with international and national law were presented. Participants considered and discussed relevant international and national standards and experiences, including in registration and documentation and access to basic rights and services.
“Nowadays international solidarity and cooperation to protect people forced to flee is needed more than ever. We trust that this roundtable will support the development of effective national legislation and practices in the fields of asylum and refugee protection. UNHCR remains committed to strongly supporting Uzbekistan joining other United Nations member states by acceding to and implementing the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, key universal treaties,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia.
During the 30th Session of the Universal Period Review (UPR) in 2018 the Republic of Uzbekistan supported the recommendations to ratify the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol and to develop an according national asylum system. NHRC and UNHCR have been working together since 2020 to support Uzbekistan’s capacity to implement UPR recommendations related to the reduction and prevention of statelessness and the protection of refugees.

“These two international treaties are emphasising key priorities for CwD. In Uzbekistan we are encouraged by the recent measures for Deinstitutionalisation and the revised Law on Education that introduced inclusive education,” said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan. “But much remains to be done for the progressive realization of all rights for all children with various types of disabilities by collectively joining efforts of parents, communities, civil society and state structures, to urgently combat stereotypes, prejudices and end discrimination against children with disabilities.”
Official figures from the Government of Uzbekistan show that 26,532 children lived in various types of residential institutions in 2018, most of whom were CwD. In 2010, 69% of all children placed in residential institutions were children with disabilities, while in 2016 - 84%.
A (2019) Situation Analysis on Persons with Disabilities in Uzbekistan demonstrated that a small part of the Uzbek society had regular contact with persons with disabilities, and those that did mostly acted from the place of pity. Further, girls and women with disabilities face multiple forms of discrimination, due to their gender and disability. Only 50% of youth with disabilities have access to vocational education.
The commemorations provided CwDs with a platform to speak to high-level decision-makers. Boys and girls shared their experiences on communication with CwD, asked questions on the state of CwD in Uzbekistan.

Title: Strengthening relations through cooperation between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan
Content: 12 May 2022
The cooperation of people around concrete joint interests, like trade, farming, employment and economic ties brings more durable and sustainable peacebuilding results. In this regard a new project “Shared prosperity through cooperation in border regions of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan” funded by United Nations Peacebuilding Fund which is jointly implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) aimed at enhancing cross-border environmental and socio-economic cooperation between two countries.
One of the important steps in integrating conflict sensitivity into the design and implementation of the project was the workshop on Conflict Sensitivity Proigramme Clinic held in Ferghana on 10-13 May, 2022.
The workshop brought together representatives of local administration of the border areas (Marhamat district of Andijan region, Yangikurgan and Kasansay districts of Namangan region), civil society and UN Agencies. The workshop was led by international experts – Phillip Priestley, Emergency and Rehabilitation Officer and Maria Norton, Conflict-sensitive Programming Consultant of the Office of Emergencies and Resilience from the FAO headquarter. The workshop provided platform to foster dialogue and cooperation among all parties involved to identify, analyze and integrate conflict sensitive strategies into the implementation of the project to lay the foundations for sustainable peace and development.
“Empowerment of rural people, mainly women and youth, introducing climate-smart agricultural practices in sustaining common resources as well as the establishment of common platforms and networks will enhance positive dialogue between communities on both sides of the border resulting in better confidence and trust between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan”, - Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan stressed.
Kamolkhon Inomkhodjaev, UNFPA Assistant Representative in Uzbekistan, noted that “Women and youth are key drivers and stakeholders of the peacebuilding processes. Empowering and engaging them will be an important part of the project to promote good neighbourhood relations and effective socio-economic collaboration across the border.”
During the workshop participants discussed the main sustaining peace drivers in the areas of governance, economic and social life, environment, natural resource management and human security and discussed potential project impacts taking into account the opinion of the local communities. As a result, they worked out the concrete conflict-sensitive recommendations to be integrated into the project implementation.
“The conflict sensitivity workshop brought together local authorities, civil societies and UN staff to ensure that our project maximises peaceful outcomes in the targeted villages in the border regions. As this is a peacebuilding project, we want to engage communities and involve them in the project to improve ownership and develop shared prosperity and understanding across borders”, - Phillip Priestley, Emergency and Rehabilitation Officer of the Office of Emergencies and Resilience from the FAO HQ noted.
The inception workshop of the project is planned for early June 2022, which will be the starting point of joint efforts aimed at fostering social, cultural and economic cross-border cooperation for better future.

Title: The UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust for the Aral Sea Region in Uzbekistan showcases results to and appreciates the support of the EU
Content: 30 April 2022
The Delegation of the European Union in Uzbekistan (EU Delegation) held a three-day mission to Karakalpakstan on 28-30 April, 2022. The visit underscores the EU’s support for development initiatives in the Aral Sea region.
On 30 April, the EU Delegation visited one of the many project sites of the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust for the Aral Sea Region in Uzbekistan (MPHSTF). The UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan. Ms. Roli Asthana, and Government representatives accompanied the Ambassadors in their visit to the MPHSTF-funded UNDP/UNESCO Joint Programme Forestry Department of the Takhtakupir district. The project in these sites sought to address the urgent human insecurities in the Aral Sea region through promoting sustainable rural development.
The Head of the Takhtakupir State Forestry Department briefly underscored that the benefits of the forestry activities funded by the MPHSTF included enhancement of the technical capacity of Takhtakupir Forestry Department as well as increasing the volume of afforestation work in the dried bed of the Aral Sea. Enhanced technical capacity helped to lant saxaul and other species on 3000 hectares of land which is six times more than it was before project interventions. The afforestation resulted in more income for the workers of the Forestry Department. The professional skills of over 100 employees from 16 departments of the State Forestry were enhanced through the trainings on “innovative methods of afforestation.”
Ms. Roli Asthana, UN Resident Coordinator, said: “The Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund’s activities in Takhtakupir’s five communities are not only testaments of UN’s commitment to the people of the Aral Sea, but also a clear messaging to the world on the readiness of UN’s partners such as the European Union and the Government of Finland, together with the Governments of Uzbekistan, Norway, and the Republic of Korea, as well as the Alwaleed Philanthropies, to ensure that no one is left behind in Karakalpakstan amidst the ongoing crises brought by the Aral Sea catastrophe.”
The UN in Uzbekistan and the Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade co-hosted an “Appreciation Dinner” for the EU Delegation. Mr. Badriddin Abidov, Deputy Minister of Investments and Foreign Trade, expressed hope for a much stronger and closer partnership with the European Union within the Trust Fund. Mr. Abidov further stated that “undoubtedly, the impacts made in the communities of Karakalpakstan - building the resilience of the local communities and the sustainable development of the Aral Sea region at large - would not have been possible without the support of partners such as the European Union.
For reference:
The MPHSTF, established under the auspices of the United Nations in late 2018, provides an integrated platform for national and international cooperation to address the ecological and socio-economic needs of communities living in the Aral Sea region, as well as to accelerate joint efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.
On May 29, 2020, the Government of Finland and the UN MPTF Office in New York (Administrator of the Trust Fund) signed the Standard Administrative Arrangement on the contribution of EURO 1 million to the UN Multi-partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea region (MPHSTF). On June 19, 2020, the Government of Finland has transferred EURO 1 million to the MPHSTF.
On February 2020, the Contribution Agreement was signed between the European Union and the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office on the contribution of EURO 5.2 million to the MPHSTF. On March 2020, the European Union has transferred USD 5.5 million to the MPHSTF.

Title: World immunization week: Long Life for All
Content: 25 April 2022
This World Immunization Week (WIW), UNICEF in Uzbekistan has joined the global community to call for ‘Long Life for All’ and congratulated the government of Uzbekistan for building a robust immunization system that has served both children and adults with life-saving vaccinations.
Uzbekistan has managed to sustain the routine immunization level at 95 – 98 percent, despite massive COVID-19 interruptions. Beyond that the country’s national deployment plan was commended as a global model in delivering COVID19 vaccinations to its people.
“The last two years have shown the merits of investing in a resilient immunization supply and logistics chain in Uzbekistan,” said Munir Mammadzade UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan. “As we go through COVID 19, years of investing in warehouses and decentralized cold chain at district and primary health levels has paid off and combined to deliver life-saving vaccines for children and adults.”
UNICEF has partnered with the Government of Uzbekistan over the last 5 years to build a robust infrastructure to support national vaccination and immunization. Over the past few years, UNICEF commissioned 21 modern cold chain facilities, equipped them with cold rooms, freezers and refrigerators. Further, it procured vehicles for the transportation of vaccines and developed a vaccine logistic management information system. In total this was nearly USD$ 20 million.
This year WIW comes against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. The year’s theme Long Life for All; Vaccines: In pursuit of a long life well lived”, recognizes the importance of vaccination for all more than ever. UNICEF has supported the government of Uzbekistan in fighting COVID-19 as the procurement, delivery and lead programme implementation agency. Since March 20221, UNICEF delivered about 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Uzbekistan through the COVAX Facility, the global mechanism for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. As of 21 April 2022, 76% of the illegible population was fully immunized.
However, UNICEF has warned that current successes can be fragile and implored on partners to reach the last mile and ensure those requiring vaccines would access and to ensure that communities remain galvanized to vaccinate.
“Public and political will is imperative to guard the gains made so far on immunization in Uzbekistan,” added Mr. Mammadzade. ”Communities need to maintain vigilance and uptake of services, while government and partners need to finance vaccination and ensure under-served communities are reached.”
World Immunization Week – celebrated every year in the last week of April – aims to highlight the collective action needed and to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against disease.  The goal of World Immunization Week is for more people – and their communities – to be protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.

Title: The UN Foundation and the UN in Uzbekistan Conclude the Learning Trip of U.S. Congressional Staffers in Uzbekistan
Content: 16 April 2022
The United Nations in Uzbekistan and the UN Foundation concluded a learning trip to Uzbekistan that included staff members from nine U.S. Congressional offices. The trip, facilitated by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, provided an overview of the 25 UN agencies, funds, and programmes operating in Uzbekistan, as well as successful initiatives led by USAID.
The delegation toured the largest vaccine facility in Central Asia, established in the capital city Tashkent with the support of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). They also interacted with young adults (age 18-30) through the UN Development Programme (UNDP)-supported entrepreneurship initiative at a monocenter (local employment center).
The group also learned about the humanitarian logistics hub in Termez, one mile from the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan border. Here the UN Refugee Agency, (UNHCR) the World Food Programme (WFP), and UNICEF facilitate the direct delivery of humanitarian supplies to neighboring Afghanistan. Through the Termez Centre for Education that the UNDP and the Uzbek government established, the group learned that there’s a unique cross-border initiative that provides scholarships and educational opportunities for Afghan women, who face barriers to education and employment in their home country.
Peter Yeo, Vice President of the UN Foundation, said: “This trip was a perfect example of how the UN, working with local governments and supported by strategic U.S. investments, can lift up a local economy and its people, including those in neighboring countries. These programs promote regional stability and prosperity, which benefits everyone.”
To further understand the work of the UN in Uzbekistan, the delegation participated in an interactive dialogue with private companies involved in the joint UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and Westminster International University in Tashkent ongoing project on “Gender Equality in the Workplace in Uzbekistan” aimed at exploring the extent to which corporate policies and mechanisms promote gender equality as well as prevent unfair treatment and gender-based violence, and support women with combining work and family responsibilities. At the Institute of Virology, the delegation interacted with HIV-positive children/adolescents and learned about the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS’ (UNAIDS) work on providing psychosocial support and non-medical care services.
The members of the U.S. Congressional offices also visited the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Samarkand, which is at the crossroads of ancient cultures and home to the Bibi-Khanum Mosque, considered a masterpiece of Islamic cultural creativity. UNESCO has played a key role in helping spur economic development and job growth in Samarkand connected to the site, while also advising the government on how to best protect and preserve cultural heritage sites for the long-term. The delegation also learned how USAID has helped train 200 entrepreneurs and tour operators to benefit from the burgeoning tourism industry.
The delegation concluded their trip learning about the Aral Sea Region and the support that the UN provides through the Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region in Uzbekistan. On their last day, the delegation also visited Artel, the first-ever Central Asian company in the household appliance and electronics sector to join the UN Global Compact.
Mr. Munir Mammadzade, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, ad interim, for Uzbekistan during the time of the visit noted that “the UN agencies in Uzbekistan including the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the International Labor Organization (ILO) were delighted to host the delegation and share the scope of work they do in Uzbekistan. The UN in Uzbekistan found the learning trip as an opportunity to show the work of the UN beyond humanitarian and peacekeeping activities.”

Title: Improving health and learning through better water, sanitation and hygiene in Karakalpakstan
Content: 12 April 2022
510 schoolchildren received access to drinking water and 500 residents of the Bozatau, Karauzyak and Kungrad districts were trained on water supply, sanitation and hygiene.
The needs assessment held by UNDP in 2021 among the residents of pilot communities in Bozatau district, revealed the lack of water supply in two local schools where 510 people study and work.
Thus with the financial support of the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea region in Uzbekistan, UNDP, UNFPA and FAO Joint Programme on "Unleashing young people’s and vulnerable citizens’ creativity and innovation by strengthening their adaptive capacity to address the economic and food insecurities in the exposed communities of the Aral Sea region", has constructed the water supply networks improving the sanitary and hygienic conditions of pilot schools in the district. Sewerage has been carried out in both buildings, washbasins, taps, and water heaters operating from solar energy have been installed and now both cold and hot water is supplied here, which is important in the harsh winters of the region.
The target population of the district was also trained on water supply, sanitation, and hygiene to raise awareness of community residents about health-related issues and promote a healthy lifestyle as hand washing is considered one of most effective ways to stay protected from various infections, including COVID-19.
In general, 500 residents of the Bozatau, Karauzyak and Kungrad districts of Karakalpakstan were trained on water, sanitation and hygiene through 7 workshops, both for school children and adults. In working with adults, organizational support was provided by another UNDP and UNFPA Joint Programme on "Building the resilience of local communities against health, environmental and economic insecurities caused by environmental destruction in the Aral Sea region" funded by the Government of Japan.
It is expected that the new knowledge and opportunities provided to the communities of the pilot districts will help to avoid the spread of various infections and prevent outbreaks of new epidemics associated with unfavorable sanitation and hygiene conditions in rural areas.

Title: FAO marks the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture in Uzbekistan
Content: 30 March 2022
FAO Uzbekistan held a workshop in the Research Institute of Fisheries of Uzbekistan focusing on the prospects for the development of artisanal fish farming and aquaculture in Uzbekistan within the framework of the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture (IYAFA 2022).
The workshop was organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in part within the scope of the FISHCap project (Capacity Building for Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture Management in Central Asia, Azerbaijan and Turkey). The FISHCap project is part of the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture (FTPP II), funded by the Government of the Republic of Turkey and aims to encourage collaboration between the private and public sectors.
“Celebrating International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture gives important recognition to the millions of small-scale fishers, fish farmers and fish workers who provide healthy and nutritious food to billions of people and contribute to achieving food security. This initiative is also an opportunity to enhance dialogue between small-scale producers of fish production. It is important to make their voices heard at all levels, so they can influence the decisions and policies that shape their everyday lives”, Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative noted.
The workshop provided a platform for FAO experts, experts  from the State Committee of Veterinary and Livestock Development and Association “Uzbekbaliqsanoat”, professors, scientific researchers and fish farmers to discuss prospects for the development of domestic fish farming and aquaculture as well as activities planned to promote artisanal fisheries and aquaculture in the country.
“Small-scale fisheries and aquaculture sector collectively produce a great bulk of global fish production while providing 90 percent of sectoral employment. There are some views that the sector has been largely ignored in policy, governance and development. However, there has been increasing focus and importance given to the sector over the last decade. FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication, enforced in 2014 by FAO, is a landmark success in due recognition of the sector. The sector needs to position itself to overcome the increasing challenges while considering new development opportunities”, said Haydar Fersoy, FAO Senior Fishery and Aquaculture Officer.
Following the workshop, participants were invited to visit the exhibition of scientific developments and achievements in intensive aquaculture in Uzbekistan. They also became familiar with the structural subdivisions of the Research Institute of Fisheries, including the laboratory complex established with FAO support, aquariums, hatchery, sturgeon and other facilities.

The Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan (GoU) continues to support communities of the Aral Sea region by making another significant contribution of $ 1.5 million to the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund (the Fund/MPHSTF) for the Aral region in Uzbekistan (MPHSTF), which is the fourth time that Uzbekistan is making such financial support.
The Government along with the United Nations in Uzbekistan being the Co-chairs of the Fund, became the first donor of the MPHSTF back in 2018. Due to the unprecedented Government support, over 20,000 people in Karakalpakstan have benefited from the programmes and projects of the Fund including 3,500 people who gained access to clean drinking water in five rural communities of Tazakonis, Beltau, Mulk, Marjankol and Janadarya.
Further, more than 12,000 mothers and newborns have received  improved medical services in the three perinatal centers in Nukus city, Kungrad, and Beruniy districts in 2021. Thirteen small business projects have been supported through capacity building and equipment procurement, as a result of which more than 60 jobs were created.
In strong cooperation with the Participating UN Organizations, national and local development partners, NGOs, CSOs, the MPHSTF adheres to its commitment to making a change in the lives of the Aral Sea communities through its development programmes. Its prospects are in enhancing the social infrastructure, improving health services and facilities, and strengthening human capital, focusing on the “leave no one behind” concept as an overarching principle.
As stated by Mr. Sardor Umurzakov, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Investments and Foreign Trade of the Republic of Uzbekistan, “to achieve the sustainability of the Aral Sea region it is imperative to join our efforts to utilize an inclusive, transparent, and effective mechanism that will enable better coordination.”
The United Nations acknowledges the continuous support of the Government of Uzbekistan towards sustainable development in the Aral Sea Region. The GoU’s commitments multiply the joint efforts and contributions from the Governments of Norway, Finland, the Republic of Korea, the European Union, and the Alwaleed Philanthropies. Through the generous support of these development partners, the MPHSTF through its programmes and projects is able to respond more to the needs of the people of the Aral Sea region reaching the vulnerable groups including children, youth, women, and the elderly.
For reference:
The MPHSTF, established under the auspices of the United Nations in late 2018, provides an integrated platform for national and international cooperation to address the ecological and socio-economic needs of communities living in the Aral Sea region, as well as to accelerate joint efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.
On 27 November 2018, the Government of Uzbekistan and the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) Office in New York signed a Standard Administrative Agreement (SAA) on a contribution of USD 6.5 million to the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral region in Uzbekistan (MPHSTF) to be transferred in four tranches from 2019 to 2022.

Title: Green Sukuk to Help Uzbekistan Achieve Sustainable Development Goals and Address Climate Change Issues
Content: 26 March 2022
On March 25, a webinar titled: “Sukuk as a promising alternative source of financing for companies and banks of Uzbekistan” was jointly organized by UNDP, the Ministry of Finance, Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), and Ansher Capital LLC. The event served as a convenient platform for discussing ongoing activities related to the introduction of Islamic finance instruments and determining the vector of further work.
In the opening part of the webinar the Deputy Minister of Finance Mr. Ahadbek Khaydarov, UNDP Resident Representative Ms. Matilda Dimovska, General Director of the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD) Mr. Ayman Sejiniy, as well as representatives of Ansher Capital LLC and House of Lords of the British Parliament delivered their welcoming remarks.
The speakers noted that the Government of Uzbekistan has been implementing large-scale reforms aimed at increasing the country's GDP per capita by 1.6 times during the next 5 years and becoming an upper middle-income country by 2030. These ambitious goals require significant financial resources, both public and private.
As of today, Islamic finance instruments, including sukuk, have emerged as a promising new source of finance. Sukuk instruments are gaining recognition not only in Muslim countries, but also worldwide. According to Fitch Rating, total amount of sukuks issued globally in 2021 alone reached USD 252 billion, while total outstanding sukuks in the market exceeded USD 711 billion.
n her welcoming remarks, Ms. Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan stressed on Green sukuk’s two-fold benefit of both as an alternative instrument to finance SDGs, and as a support to the climate change agenda. Green sukuk is a new type of sukuk that is used to finance environmentally sustainable projects, for example, in renewable energy, energy efficient and resource-saving technologies, solid waste management, and others.
“Considering this in mind, UNDP and the Islamic Development Bank have launched a Technical Assistance project aimed at assisting the Government of Uzbekistan in establishing a proper enabling environment for green sukuk in the country. The goal of this initiative is to develop relevant legislative and regulatory framework as well as to elaborate the National Green Sukuk Framework for Uzbekistan,” added Ms. Matilda Dimovska.
The webinar sessions and discussions covered practical issues of introducing sukuk and Green sukuk in Uzbekistan. The representative of the international law firm “White & Case” Mr. Debashis Day presented the work stream of creating an enabling environment on the issuance of Plain Vanilla Sukuk and Green Sukuk in the capital markets of Uzbekistan. Managing Director of Ansher Capital Toshtemir Khaydarov spoke about the practical aspects of issuing sukuk bonds for companies of Uzbekistan.
At the end of the webinar, participants and experts exchanged views, provided proposals for the diversification of financial products and the introduction of Islamic financial instruments in Uzbekistan.

Title: Climate change explained: young people are piloting a new online course
Content: 09 March 2022
UN Development Programme (UNDP) jointly with the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has conducted an initial discussion on “Involvement of Youth in Combatting Climate Change” for those who signed up for a new online course on "Climate Change Negotiations and COP 26 outcomes" developed within this project.
The initial cohort piloting the online course are mostly students from the International Digital University (IDU) and TEAM University. During the event they learned about the issues related to climate change and opportunities for youth involvement at the national and regional (Central Asian) level to contribute to climate action.
Rano Baykhanova, UNDP Programme Analyst on Climate Change, has briefed the participants on the nationally determined contributions (NDC2) to greenhouse gases emission reductions commitments of the Republic of Uzbekistan under the ratified Paris Agreement on climate and announced at the recent 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Glasgow in November 2021. She emphasized that Uzbekistan has increased its commitments aiming at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030 (vs 10% committed earlier). Involvement of youth and raising their awareness about climate change impacts are of paramount importance for the national commitments’ implementation. It is well known that due to its geographical position, Uzbekistan is very vulnerable to climate change impacts and is exposed to increasing climate aridity, more frequent drought, changing patterns of precipitations and water stress as well as faces more frequent extreme weather events (dust and salt storms, strong winds, heavy rains, landslides, etc.) This all affect sustainable economic and social development of the country.
The project experts provided detailed information on learning and engagement opportunities available to students within the framework of the project. A tailored online learning programme has been developed for the young women and men to get better understanding of the matters related to climate change in Uzbekistan. The course is available to all interested ones based on registration during the pilot period. Those interested can sign up for the course at the link: https://forms.gle/Sc8Xrid6tyrVpXTP6 .
The participants shared their feedback on the event, and Alisher Jumanazarov, an IDU Faculty Officer, noted that “Climate change related problems are of great interest, and many students would like to be engaged in the provided learning opportunity. Events like this and programmes offered are some of the most appreciated undertakings that allow students to start building their networks and engaging with the climate change matters and finding solutions”.
The initial cohort of more than 25 students increased their knowledge about UNDP’s activities focused on climate education and raising awareness about the COP26 outcomes and Paris Agreement. Moreover, during the event the youth focused actions planned within the framework of the UNDP/FCDO project “Policy action for climate security in Central Asia Phase II”/under the Joint Programme UNDP/UNFPA “Unleashing young people’s and vulnerable citizens’ creativity and innovation by strengthening their adaptive capacity to address the economic and food insecurities in the exposed communities of the Aral Sea region” have been advertised and discussed. It is anticipated that after the piloting online course it will be refined and made publicly accessible for all to increase climate change related knowledge and to being actively involved in climate action in Uzbekistan.

Title: Businesses ready to provide women and girls with safe spaces from street harassment
Content: 04 March 2022
Street harassment is a form of harassment that consists of unwanted sexualized comments, provocative gestures, whistling, stalking, persistent sexual advances, and touching by strangers, in public areas such as streets, shopping malls and public transportation. It is a global phenomenon, and women worldwide suffer from it.
In some countries such as France, the Netherlands, Philippines and Tajikistan, such behavior is outlawed. In many other countries there are public initiatives creating informal protection mechanisms, mostly within social responsibility. Often in street harassment cases, a temporary shelter allowing to wait out or calling a companion for the further journey can resolve the issue.
United Nations Development Programme in Uzbekistan contacted a range of private sector representatives with invitation to shape a voluntary alliance based on corporate social responsibility to launch a pilot initiative that bears the name “Call Umida” that would provide informal mechanism allowing women and young girls to find a temporary space safe from harassment, chasing, and stalking on our streets.  The location of safe spaces and more detailed information on the initiative can be found on the website callumida.uz, which was developed with the support of IT Park.
“The initiative we are launching today is unique for the country and especially important, because it is a voluntary commitment by series of corporate sector representatives, who are expressing readiness to share their resources to contribute to creating the network of safe spaces for women and girls escaping street harassment as part of their good citizenship, social responsibility, and empathy”, shared in her in her speech Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan. She added, “As we are launching this initiative a few days before the International Women’s Day and the theme of this year is “Gender Equality today for the sustainable tomorrow”. Sustainable and fair development is only possible when everybody counts, and no one is left behind. Only in safety can one reach its full potential in education, employment, access to healthcare or any other basic human needs. We need streets safe for girls and women, too”.
The managers of “Korzinka”, the largest retail network in the country, “Testo by Zamira & Co.”, “YaponaMama”, “Caravan Group” restaurant chains, Steam Bar, Turka Saray, “GroundZero” coworking spaces, “CyberArena” computer club, “Asklepiy Group” pharmacy network, TEAM University, IT Park came forward ready to invest their time and effort to support the pilot initiative. NeMolchi.uz is informational partner of the project. The initiative is considered launched today and will be rolled out throughout the nearest month.
“As a socially responsible company, we stand against street harassment and join “CallUmida” initiative. We are engaging our team at all of our markets across Uzbekistan to provide safe places for women and girls when needed. In partnership with UNDP, we believe that cities can be safer for women and look forward to raise awareness to stop street harassment. Having more safe places will definitely strengthen the peace of mind for all of our children and loved ones”, — commented Zafar Khashimov, CEO of “Korzinka” supermarket chain.
Other businesses who would like to join “Call Umida” pilot initiative and expand this network of safe spaces are welcome to express their interest by sending the message via the contact button on the website.
This initiative is being piloted within UNDP Accelerator Lab in Uzbekistan, a part of the world's largest and fastest learning network on sustainable development challenges. UNDP Accelerator Lab works together with national and global partners to find new approaches and solutions to current development challenges based on accelerated learning process, which relies on sense-making, collective intelligence, solutions mapping and experimentation.
Disclaimer: The "Call Umida" pilot initiative does not replace or provide law enforcement, legal, psychological, moral, material assistance as might be necessary in individual cases. Authorized and specialized bodies should be contacted for further protection or support. The timing and mode of temporary protection is determined by the operational and other arrangements of each partner and is subject to change.

This landmark international event, proposed by the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev in his address to the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, and coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the Joint Plan of Action (JPoA)  will make a significant contribution to consolidating the efforts of the countries of the region and the international community in the implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (UN GCTS) in Central Asia.
The conference is co-organized by the Institute for Strategic and Regional Studies under the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan (ISRS), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT), the UN Regional Center for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia (UNRCCA) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The Tashkent Conference will be held in a hybrid format with more than 600 senior Member State officials from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, including the five permanent members of the Security Council, together with representatives of international and regional organizations, think tanks, and civil society institutions.
Among the invitees are the members of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Compact for the implementation of counter-terrorism measures, representatives of Member States as well as donor states of counter-terrorism activities.

Within the framework of the conference, in the form of panel discussions, four breakout sessions will be held on each of the four pillars of the GCTS.  These include: (i) addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism; (ii) Preventing and countering terrorism; (iii) building states’ capacity to prevent and combat terrorism and to strengthen the role of the United Nations system in that regard; and (iv) ensuring respect for human rights for all and the rule of law as the fundamental basis for the fight against terrorism.
Three side events will be held on the margins of the Conference: (1) the role of the SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) in strengthening cooperation between the states of Central Asia within the framework of the JPoA; (2) the implementation of the UN GCTS, gender aspects in the work with women and children returning from war zones; and (3) financial support for programs to counter terrorism. These side events will be organized by SCO RATS, OSCE, UNOCT and their partners.
The key documents following the outcome of the international meeting should be the Tashkent Declaration and updated Joint Plan of Action, in which the countries of Central Asia will define specific tasks for and reaffirm their commitment to the joint fight against terrorism, which poses a serious threat to international peace and security.

Title: Uzbekistan: Government and the UN Conclude the First Joint Programme of the Joint SDG Fund
Content: 26 February 2022
The Government of Uzbekistan in partnership with the UN agencies concluded its first UN Joint Programme sponsored by the Joint SDG Fund. Three sister-agencies - the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) together with the Ministry of Finance reported on the achievements in the social protection system accomplished by the Programme in 2020-2022.
The UN Joint Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Fund allocated US$ 2 million for twofold purpose of the programme: improving social protection systems to accelerate progress towards achievement of SDGs and to enhance multilateral collaboration. From the UN side, UNICEF was the leading agency of the Joint Programme.
“The three UN agencies, namely UNICEF, ILO and UNDP, have brought together the expertise and good practices to support the Government in establishing the basis for a strong social protection system. During these two years, great results were achieved, with more than 2 million people benefiting directly from the joint work. At the same time, a lot still needs to be done to ensure a comprehensive social protection system reaches all in need, leaving no one behind. We stand ready to continue supporting the Government of Uzbekistan in achieving its plans and successful implementation of its 2022-2026 Development Strategy, the upcoming National Strategy for Social Protection and the 2030 Agenda in the country.” - said Mr. Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan.
At the onset of the UN Joint Programme, the social protection system of Uzbekistan covered only 55% of the population. It was primarily through social insurance that was reaching 44% of the population. Only one out of three persons living in poverty would receive social benefits.
Thanks to the Government and UN joint efforts more people got access to the social benefits and social services. It has been achieved through the following:
Furthermore, the UN Joint Programme introduced advanced approaches in provision of social services like makhalla-level social work based on case management.
These achievements determine the outset of a long journey to ensure the human right for social protection for all. The participating UN agencies called for further support to Uzbekistan in reforming its social protection system and implementing the National Strategy for Social Protection, in enhancing the capacity to coordinate and deliver social protection schemes and ensuring inclusiveness of different groups, including persons with disability and informal workers.

Content: 18 February 2022
UNHCR sent 20 tons of humanitarian assistance with core relief items from the Termez Cargo Centre, Uzbekistan, to Tajikistan. The delivery is part of UNHCR’s efforts to assist the Government of Tajikistan in preparation to the possible refugee influx from Afghanistan.
The first shipment of humanitarian supplies includes approximately 20 tons of Refugee Housing Units, that is a part of overall consignment prepared for delivery to Tajikistan, such as family tents, sleeping mats, kitchen sets, plastic sheets and other core relief items. Delivered to Termez by air and land in November-December 2021, these goods have now been trucked to Tajikistan to stockpile life-saving assistance that enables UNHCR and its state counterparts to rapidly respond and provide humanitarian assistance when it is needed the most.
“In Tajikistan, the humanitarian community, under the coordination of UNHCR, is supporting the government to enhance emergency preparedness and response. This first humanitarian cargo sent to Tajikistan from UNHCR hub in Termez is one example. UNHCR is committed to providing further assistance to the government through the Refugee Coordination Model which brings together more than 30 national and international humanitarian and development agencies in Tajikistan. UNHCR also appreciates the continued support of donors, particularly the Government of Japan and European Union.”, said UNHCR Representative in Tajikistan, Mulugeta Zewdie.
This humanitarian assistance was made possible thanks to the generous contribution of the Government of Japan in the amount of 700,000 USD and the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid which allocated 500,000 Euros.
The consignments were sent from UNHCR’s humanitarian hub established in October 2021 in the Termez Cargo Centre with the support of the Government of Uzbekistan. The Termez Cargo Centre is a logistics and emergency response hub to enhance pre-positioning and rapid delivery of Core Relief Items to Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asian region affected by the Afghanistan situation. The hub increases UNHCR’s agility to respond, enabling rapid replenishment of local supplies, while reducing costs and risks associated with carrying large inventory in each operation.

Title: The EU Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Risk Mitigation Centres of Excellence Initiative: Workshop on the National Action Plan Review for Uzbekistan
Content: 11 February 2022
Within the framework the European Union (EU) Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Centres of Excellence (CoE) Initiative (EU CBRN CoE), the State Committee on Industrial Safety of the Republic of Uzbekistan, together with the EU Joint Research Center (JRC) and the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI), held a workshop to review and update the CBRN National Action Plan (NAP) of Uzbekistan.
The online event was attended by representatives of the State Committee on Industrial Safety of the Republic of Uzbekistan, experts from the JRC, UNICRI and the CBRN National Team for Uzbekistan, represented by various ministries and agencies and closely involved in the implementation of the NAP.
The meeting was opened by Mr. Bakhtiyor Gulyamov, Head of the EU CBRN CoE Regional Secretariat for Central Asia, who welcomed the participants and briefly highlighted the results achieved in the implementation of the National Action Plan in Uzbekistan during 2018-2021. He also highlighted the importance of the NAP to ensure the fulfillment of the international commitments in the sphere of chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear safety and security.
The first day of the meeting was devoted to aspects pertaining the implementation of the NAP for 2018-2021, where the National CBRN Team of Uzbekistan had the opportunity to outline the main achievements and challenges. The second and third days made it possible for the experts to elaborate on the process of drafting the CBRN NAP based on the lessons learned from the implementation of the previous document and from the COVID pandemic. The sessions covered sections related to chemical and biological materials, as well as radiological and nuclear (RN) risk mitigation aspects. Throughout the workshop, the JRC experts provided an elaborate hands-on training on the methodology related to the identification and prioritization of needs, with a focus on all four areas of work – chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security. Overall, the workshop was of high interest and put forward many interesting proposals, stimulating participants to further investigate pertinent aspects on their own.
Upon workshop completion, the National CBRN Team of Uzbekistan has embarked on the development of the new NAP for the period of 2022-2024. It is expected that the new NAP will target a number of priorities, such as preventing the illicit movement and proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery; improvement of the regulatory framework in the field of chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear safety; strengthening the material and technical base of authorized state bodies; organization of training, retraining and mentoring of personnel; and strengthening international and regional cooperation and active exchange of experience in the field of chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear safety.

Title: UNICEF and Cybercrime Center of the Ministry of Interior launch partnership to protect children from online violence
Content: 08 February 2022
According to the global evidence, one-third of all internet users are children under 18 years and a child goes online for the first time every half second.
Globally, every day more and more children and adolescents get access to information and communication technologies, and Uzbekistan is no exception. The pandemic of COVID-19 contributed to accelerating this process and pushed both children and adults to spend even more time online than before.
When used in the right way – and accessible to all – the internet has the potential to broaden horizons and ignite creativity the world over. However, with these opportunities come serious risks and dangers for children which take many various forms such as cyberbullying, cyber harassment, online grooming, and others.
On the Day of Safer Internet, globally marked on 8 February, UNICEF and Cybercrime Center of the Ministry of Interior have launched cooperation with the aim to reduce harm and protect children from online violence. Parliamentarians, Authorized Person of Oliy Majlis for Child Rights, representatives of state agencies, and non-governmental organizations took part in the event.
“Expanding internet access and reducing the digital divide is vital for ensuring that all children and young people are learning and acquiring the knowledge and skills they need to be successful. Unfortunately, with all the benefits, the Internet is also associated with online abuse, exploitation and misinformation. Therefore, the best way to tackle both online and offline violence is to apply a systems-based approach in dealing with these issues”, said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan. “Addressing the issues of violence against children requires improved parenting, increased awareness of children themselves, strengthened social service and child protection workforces as well as strong legislative and institutional frameworks, including data collection and management system”, he added.
“In today's world of globalization, the views of young people change every day. One of the main reasons for this is their active use of modern information communications, the ability to keep abreast of world events and news. In this regard, in our country, where the majority of the population is young people, it is important to prevent and combat cyber threats against them,” said Behzod Mamadjanov, head of the Cybercrime Center of the Ministry of Interior.
As the way forward in fighting both online and offline violence against children, participants recommended improving inter-agency cooperation, active participation of civil society organizations, awareness-raising, and educating parents and frontline specialists on how to support children and protect them from online threats.

Content: 31 January 2022
UNESCO Office in Tashkent has conducted the Second Project Steering Committee meeting in the framework of “Skills Development for Employability in Rural Areas of Uzbekistan” Project funded by the European Union. High-level officials from the Ministries of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, Agriculture, Water resources, Employment and Labor Relations, and the State Inspection for Supervision of Quality in Education, as well as the Ambassador of the European Union to the Republic of Uzbekistan, UNESCO Representative in Uzbekistan a.i. and the project stakeholders participated at the event. The meeting reviewed the project achievements in 2021 and discussed the 2022 work plan and the budget allocations.
In his welcoming speech Mr. Komiljon Karimov, First Deputy Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education and the Chairperson of the Project Steering Committee stated  “Education is a key priority as it was expressed by our distinguished President Mr. Shavkat Mirziyoyev and it is highlighted in recently issued Decree “On the Development Strategy of New Uzbekistan for 2022-2026”. We are aiming to introduce the reforms in education sector based on the best international experience.  UNESCO, as the UN agency with mandate in education, has accumulated substantial experience during 75 years and it was a right choice to appoint it as a project implementing agency. I believe that this project may positively influence not only the education sector development, but it would also be beneficial for development of the country.”
UNESCO Representative in Uzbekistan a.i. Mr. Alexandros Makarigakis informed participants that in the first year of implementation, the project contributed towards achievement of the following results: i)  Operationalization of the recently established Sector Skills Councils; ii) A TVET strategy in place for the Agriculture and Irrigation sectors; iii) Draft occupational maps were completed based on a thorough skills needs assessment in agriculture and irrigation sectors; iv) First stage of the assessment of teaching material, teaching methodologies, project facilities and available equipment was completed in agriculture and irrigation colleges in the four regions of the country; leading to their modernization.
The Ambassador of the European Union to Uzbekistan, Ms. Charlotte Adriaen highlighted:  “The European Union supports technical vocational education and training (TVET) development reforms, which eventually should bring a positive impact on development of skilled human capital and lead to economic growth as well as employability of young women and men in rural areas of Uzbekistan. New Multi-Annual Indicative Programme for Uzbekistan for 2021-2027 which was recently adopted and a new EU Strategy for Central Asia for 2021-2027 confirm that the education sector and TVET in particular are one of the main areas for further development cooperation.  It is important to highlight that EU-UNESCO joint project is designed to support an ongoing reforms in skills development system of Uzbekistan with a particular focus on agriculture and irrigation sectors.”
Background information about the Project:
UNESCO and the European Union jointly with the Government of Uzbekistan launched the project in 2020. The European Union provided 9.6 million euros with the purpose to implement the project in 2020-2024 in four regions of Uzbekistan: Republic of Karakalpakstan, Khorezm, Bukhara, and Surkhandarya. Upon its completion, the project will contribute to enhancement of living standards in rural areas through better employability by equipping women and men with relevant skills for the sustainable, diversified and modernized agriculture with higher productivity.

Title: Joint UN-Uzbekistan Achievements in Strengthening the Social Protection System Discussed
Content: 17 December 2021
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) organized a meeting for national and international development partners to discuss the achievements of the UN Joint Programme on Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan and to foster actions for social protection strengthening in the context of the ongoing reforms and COVID-19 pandemic.
The event, co-chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance and UNICEF Representative for Uzbekistan, hosted more than 40 participants from the line ministries, national stakeholders, as well as international development organizations, foreign embassies and UN agencies.
“The Joint Programme in Uzbekistan reflects Global Partnership for Universal Social Protection to achieve Sustainable Development Goals through the integration of main principles in the local context: social protection throughout the lifecycle; universal coverage; sustainable and equitable financing; civil society participation and social dialogue, especially with persons with disabilities by leaving no one behind.  We appreciate all national and development partners who provide their continuous support to the successful implementation of social protection reforms in the country and look forward to their renewed commitment in 2022 and beyond.” - Mr. Munir Mamedzade, UNICEF Representative for Uzbekistan.
In 2020, UNICEF, ILO and UNDP combined their efforts within the UN Joint Programme on Social Protection in Uzbekistan with the aim of building a comprehensive architecture of social protection system that will consider the needs of vulnerable groups and ensure that no-one is left behind. The Programme was financially supported by the UN Joint Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Fund with a twofold purpose: improving social protection systems to accelerate progress towards achievement of SDGs and to enhance multilateral collaboration.
The social protection system in Uzbekistan was fragmented at institutional, policy and programme levels, which resulted in ineffective leadership over the significant component of the government’s portfolio of programmes aimed at the population’s welfare and reduced impact of financial investments. As the social protection system is based on a non-universal principle, welfare programmes could not reach all vulnerable groups contributing to social exclusion, marginalisation, deepening poverty, inequality and hindering economic growth. As a result, the social protection system covered 55% of the population, primarily through social insurance that reached 44% of the population. Only one out of three persons living in poverty received some social benefits.
Within the UN Joint Programme, UNICEF facilitated institutional reforms to ensure that leadership of the social protection system is consolidated and strengthened while programme delivery is enhanced. This includes a unified institution providing social protection. Jointly with the Ministry of Finance and other relevant ministries a draft decree on establishing the Agency of Social Protection was developed. The document outlined the agency’s main functions, structure and a plan on introduction of advanced approaches in provision of social services like makhalla-level social work based on case management.
During the Programme, the Single Registry of Social Protection was piloted and spread out nationwide.  It removed administrative barriers, provided with clear eligibility criteria, and simplified the payment process. It resulted in a 5-fold rise in the monthly number of submitted applications from 80,000 to 400,000 and the overall coverage of vulnerable population from around 600 000 to 1.2 mln people.
The ILO within the Programme focused on supporting the Government of Uzbekistan in developing the first national strategy for social protection. On February 17, 2021, the President of the Republic signed a decree No. 5634 “On measures to improve the system of social protection of the population of the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2021-2030” that also approved the Concept of the National Strategy for Social Protection for 2021-2030 and Roadmap for the development of the NSSP for 2021-2030. Subsequently, fully fledged National Strategy for Social Protection 2022-2030 with measures to improve social assistance schemes, social insurance, access of persons  who face multiple barriers when seeking employment to labour market  policies and social care services was developed under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with social partners and representatives of persons with disabilities. It is accompanied by a three-year costed Action Plan and options for fiscal space for social protection.  Review of national legislation to ensure compliance with international social security standards is underway.
UNDP has supported the rights of vulnerable groups of the population, particularly of persons with disabilities. It advocated for the ratification and implementation of UN CRPD, helped fostering knowledge and expertise to support the planned transition to the International Classification of Functioning in the assessment of disability, disability statistics collection, accessible infrastructure and public services.
These achievements determine the outset of a long journey to ensure the human right for social protection for all. The participating UN agencies called for further support to Uzbekistan in reforming its social protection system, implementing tasks outlined in the National Strategy for Social Protection, integration of planning and provision of social services and social benefits, building the capacity of agencies on coordination and delivery of social protection schemes, ensuring inclusiveness of different groups, including persons with disability and informal workers.

Title: UNHCR sends humanitarian aid to Afghanistan through Termez in Uzbekistan
Content: 15 December 2021
Today the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, trucked humanitarian goods from Termez, Uzbekistan, to Afghanistan. The delivery is part of UNHCR’s aid effort to Afghanistan and a massive operation to provide life-saving aid to the people of Afghanistan.
The consignments were sent from UNHCR’s humanitarian hub established in the Termez Cargo Centre with support of the Government of Uzbekistan. Located less than two kilometers from the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan border, the Termez Cargo Centre in southern Uzbekistan is a key part of UNHCR’s efforts to secure humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people.
Humanitarian supplies include approximately 40 tons of core relief items, such as kitchen sets and plastic sheets. Delivered to Termez by air and land in October-November 2021, these good have now been trucked to Afghanistan to replenish stocks held locally and to respond to emerging needs.
“We appreciate the ongoing support of the Uzbek Government and local partners in Termez enabling UNHCR to provide quick humanitarian assistance when it is needed the most. Now when millions of Afghans face food insecurity and are extremely vulnerable surviving the harsh winter, urgent help is required to save lives and prevent humanitarian crisis,” said Mr Frank Remus, UNHCR Senior Liaison Officer.
UNHCR pre-positioned humanitarian supplies at Termez as part of its overall emergency response and preparedness strategy for the region. In addition to holding a contingency stockpile of UNHCR core relief items, the Termez hub also serves as the main consolidation and transfer point to deliver material assistance to UNHCR’s operations in Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia. Accordingly, regular consignments of humanitarian supplies will be sent through Termez for the duration of UNHCR’s response to the Afghanistan emergency.

Title: Uzbekistan: UN expert applauds return of women and children from conflict zones, recommends further reforms
Content: 07 December 2021
A UN human rights expert today commended the Uzbekistan Government for the return and repatriation of women and children from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan but recommended authorities substantially reform the country’s extremism and counter-terrorism laws.
At the end of 10-day visit to the country, addressing a range of counter-terrorism issues the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, called for increased measures to protect fundamental human rights including expression, assembly, fair trial, deprivation of liberty, freedom from torture, and the right to religious freedom and belief.
​
The expert praised the Government for its Operation Mehr, or Mercy operational since May 2019 involving the repatriation and reintegration of hundreds of women and children mostly from conflict zones in Syria but also from Iraq and Afghanistan.
“The Uzbek model premised on family unity and community support is an example of best practice on repatriation, placing the best interest of the child, and the meaningful reintegration of women returning from conflict zones at the centre of political, legal and social action,” Ní Aoláin said.
Thousands of women and children have been arbitrarily detained in camps in North-East Syria. UN experts say they are exposed to violence, exploitation, abuse and deprivation in conditions and treatment that may well amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international law, with no effective remedy at their disposal. They have called on dozens of States to facilitate their repatriation.
Ní Aoláin commended the Government’s practical focus on avoiding stigmatization, ensuring access to fundamental rights including economic and social rights, and underscored the value of the Government’s partnership with UNICEF, and other UN human rights entities, including her mandate and OHCHR.
“The Uzbek model of repatriation and reintegration provides a road-map for other governments to return their nationals from conflict zones,” she said, adding the country had shown how this can be done effectively, humanely and in a human rights compliant manner.
She encouraged ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the repatriation process to ensure ongoing human rights protection and sharing of knowledge among key stakeholders including the international community and civil society.
The Special Rapporteur also closely examined Uzbekistan’s counter-terrorism and extremism laws and identified concerns about the broad and vague content of numerous criminal code provisions. She said significant revisions were necessary to ensure their compliance with international law as well as standards on countering terrorism and human rights. She highlighted the need to address the negative impact on civil society and non-profit organizations from the current regulations addressing countering terrorism finance in line with FATF recommendations and human rights standards.
In respect of past human rights violations, she said accountability and transparency would increase and deepen current reform efforts. Ní Aoláin recommended the establishment of a formal and independent review mechanism with the capacity to investigate and provide meaningful remedies and reparations to address serious violations of human rights of those persons previously detained in national security cases particularly those who experienced torture, inhuman or degrading treatment.

Title: Artel joins the United Nations Global Compact and the Coalition of Business Champions for the Sustainable Development of Uzbekistan, underscoring its commitment to global and national sustainability
Content: 04 December 2021
As Central Asia’s leading producer of household appliances and electronics, Artel Electronics LLC (Artel) has long been committed to advancing its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) program. This week, Artel further solidified this commitment by joining the United Nations (UN) Global Compact initiative—a voluntary leadership platform launched in 2000 for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices. Artel joins nearly 14,000 businesses globally to support the global sustainable development ambitions.
On 28 November 2021, Artel became the first-ever Central Asian company in the household appliance and electronics sector to join the UN Global Compact. Artel is a producer of a wide range of household appliances, including air conditioners, gas and electric cookers, refrigerators, electric water boilers, and televisions, and will become the third Uzbek company to join the initiative.
As one of Uzbekistan’s most recognizable brands, Artel has been a staunch supporter of initiatives that help the society, with a specific focus on women, educational initiatives, and water projects. Artel has recently supported the promotion of the UN campaign on the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence in Uzbekistan and is opening a weekly women’s legal clinic internally to raise legal literacy. This year, the company also provided the infrastructure for access to water to a village in Jizzakh region, an initiative that they intend to replicate elsewhere next year. The company is also dedicated to increasing the energy efficiency of its products and has recently reviewed its corporate governance to align with international best practice.
“Promoting a sustainable digital future has been front and center in our operations and strategy. Artel has long been contemplating how to scale its actions to support environmental protection and inclusivity, as well as sustainable production and consumption. Our membership of the UN Global Compact and the Coalition of Business Champions for the Sustainable Development demonstrates how earnestly Artel takes the responsibility of leading the way in reaching the national and global sustainability targets,” said Bektemir Murodov, Chief Financial Officer of Artel.
Mr. Yu Yu, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, ad interim, for Uzbekistan noted that “the UN in Uzbekistan is delighted that Artel has taken the step to add their voice to the growing global group of businesses that support the global ambitions on environmental and social responsibility. In particular, the UN in Uzbekistan is keen to welcome Artel as one of the founding members of the Coalition of Business Champions for the Sustainable Development in Uzbekistan, joining a giant food retailer and an agro-industrial company promoting sustainably produced cotton from Uzbekistan.” The action taken by Artel comes at a very opportune moment, positioning Uzbekistan to be a regional and even global leader in advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals through partnership and collaboration.
The UN in Uzbekistan stands ready to partner with the private sector and businesses in incorporating sustainability principles and facilitate the dialogue between interested business organizations to drive change in business behavior and help drive the country’s sustainability agenda and national development goals. Mr. Yu Yu continued that, “together, the UN and the private sector can combine and capitalize on its comparative strengths and resources to deliver the much-needed and meaningful results to the present and future generations.”

Title: International Conference on Cold Winter Deserts
Content: 03 December 2021
The first International Conference on Cold Winter Deserts was held in Tashkent within the framework of the CADI (Central Asian Desert Initiative) project. It was organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the State Forestry Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan in cooperation with the University of Greifswald (Germany) and the Michael Succow Foundation.
Bringing together the researchers, academia, scientific institutions, and stakeholders including students from local and international universities, and representatives of international organizations, the conference is set to become a platform for discussing options for the development and conservation of the temperate desert territories. It will also raise awareness about advanced technologies for sustainable land management and disseminate knowledge about biodiversity conservation in the ecosystems of temperate desert zones.
Among the regions of Central Asia, the temperate deserts of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are listed as being of global importance for the conservation of biodiversity. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the deserts can claim the status of world heritage sites. These unique landscapes support the existence of rare species of animals, including wild gazelles, kulans and urials. They also serve as important nesting and migration sites for bird species such as the burial eagle, bustard and saker falcon. However, these territories are currently threatened by the overuse of their natural resources and large-scale infrastructure construction.
Consequently, these territories are being targeted by the Central Asia Desert Initiative. The CADI project, funded by the German Government, has been runsince 2016 by the University of Greifswald, the Michael Succow Foundation and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
“Central Asia is a global biodiversity hotspot located in the heart of Earth's largest continent. It features unique habitats, breeding grounds, migration corridors and flyways for many rare and endangered animal species. The CADI project aims to conserve and ensure the sustainable use of temperate deserts, which are unique ecosystems of global importance.”, - said National Coordinator of the CADI project Nariman Nishanov.
The project supports communities involved in agriculture in the harsh conditions of the temperate deserts. In particular, project activities include provision of equipment for wool processing, sewing, milk processing, beekeeping, as well as the distribution of seeds and seedlings to farmers and smallholders.

Title: UNDP, with the support of the Government of Japan, launches social infrastructure facilities in Karakalpakstan
Content: 25 November 2021
Ms. Matilda Dimovska, Resident Representative of UNDP in Uzbekistan, H.E. Mr. Yoshinori Fujiyama, Ambassador of Japan to Uzbekistan and Mr. Yu Yu, Representative of UNFPA in Uzbekistan attended the launch ceremony of the pilot facilities in Karakalpakstan.
Today, Ms. Matilda Dimovska, Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Uzbekistan, H.E. Mr. Yoshinori Fujiyama, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to Uzbekistan and Mr. Yu Yu, Representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in Uzbekistan paid a visit to the Republic of Karakalpakstan. The purpose of the visit was to meet with national partners, discuss prospects for further cooperation, get acquainted with the implementation of joint initiatives in the Aral Sea region, launch pilot facilities to improve the infrastructure of rural districts, and participate in the celebration of International Volunteer Day. The mission was organized within the framework of the Joint UNDP-UNFPA Programme on "Building the resilience of local communities against health, environmental and economic insecurities caused by environmental destruction in the Aral Sea region", funded by the Government of Japan.
According to the visit agenda, the first meeting was held at a high level in the Jokargy Kenes of the Republic of Karakalpakstan with Mr. Murat Kamalov, Chairperson of the Jokargy Kenes. In her welcoming speech, Ms. Matilda Dimovska emphasized that UNDP looks forward to raising the ambition of joint engagement to support the implementation of the UN Resolution on the Aral Sea region – Zone of Ecological Innovation and Technology, thus ensuring the sustainable development of the region. She thanked the Government of Uzbekistan, the Government of Karakalpakstan and the Government of Japan for support and joining hands in this important endeavour.
“I hope that this visit will serve as a standing point for further enhanced collaboration to jointly explore synergies and coordinated assistance to the Aral Sea region," concluded Ms. Matilda Dimovska.
International Volunteer Day
Representatives of the delegation took part in a celebratory event dedicated to the International Volunteer Day, which is celebrated annually on December 5. Overall, 2,081 community health volunteers have been trained in Karakalpakstan within the framework of UNDP projects in 11 districts of Karakalpakstan. Today, they continue their activities with financial support from the Government of Japan to raise awareness among the population, in particular young people, on health issues and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
Many of the volunteers were active and helped in prevention of the spread of various diseases during the quarantine for COVID-19 in 2020. They continued to consult by phone, online and through a group on Telegram messenger, inquiring about the condition of their fellow villagers.
More than 100 volunteers from pilot districts throughout the region were invited to participate in the celebratory event, which took place at the Theater of a Young Spectator with the support of the Ministry of Health of Karakalpakstan. The most active of them received memorable prizes and gifts from representatives of the mission under five special nominations.
Facilities for the development of social infrastructure and support of entrepreneurial initiatives, Chimbay
After the official ceremony, the delegation members left for the Chimbay district of Karakalpakstan to visit the pilot communities of the UNDP-UNFPA Joint Programme.
At the beginning of 2021, within the framework of the Joint Programme, a call for innovative business projects and ideas was announced. An application from the head of "Ramazan Sarsenbaev" private enterprise was among the business project proposed for co-financing, with a solution for farmers for the long-term storage of large volumes of vegetables and fruits. In support of the business idea to ensure food security in the region, a cold room was constructed and equipped in the district. Now the refrigeration complex is able to accommodate up to 100 tons of fruit and vegetables. Moreover, personnel were trained on the use and operation of the equipment provided.
Today, the launch of this facility took place, thanks to which over 112 thousand residents of the Chimbaysky district have received access to fresh agricultural products at any time of the year. Similar projects were also implemented in the Bozatau and Karauzyak districts.
Five hundred and fifty people live in "Koshkar zhykkan" community, "Mayzhap" village. The village water treatment facility was not functioning due to deterioration, and only an old well remained in its place. Local residents had to pump water from the ground which did not meet standards of sanitation and hygiene. This problem was voiced during a community mobilization workshop organized to identify the needs of rural residents and discuss development plans. With the support of the Joint Programme, the district administration and the residents themselves initiated a large-scale effort to implement a water project.
As a result, the water treatment facility was completely reconstructed, water desalination equipment with a capacity of 8 m3/hour was installed, 4,990 meters of water supply network were supplied. Sixty-eight households received access to clean drinking water.
In addition, water supply networks with a length of 10,600 meters were laid in the "Zhanamakan" of the rural gathering of citizens "Bakhytli" and in the makhalla gathering of citizens "Guzhimli" of the Chimbay district, which allowed another 650 residents to receive clean drinking water that presented no harm to their health.
Taking care of women's health
According to the official data, an average 1,660 cases of cervical cancer are registered, and more than 800 women are die every year. In Uzbekistan, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women of all ages after breast cancer.
As part of the implementation of the Joint Programme, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uzbekistan received testing equipment, test systems and consumables for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV). The testing phase is in progress in 10 pilot districts of the Republic of Karakalpakstan: Kungrad, Chimbay, Bozatau, Muynak, Karauzyak, Shumanay, Khodjeyli, Kegeyli, Kanlykol, and Nukus districts. During this period, 36% of women were tested, 5% defined as HPV positive and 1% of women were referred to the oncologists. HPV positive women will be further monitored in medical facilities to prevent onset of cervical cancer.
During the meeting at the district multidisciplinary polyclinic in Chimbay, representatives of the mission got acquainted with the results of work in this area. To date, of the 50 women who were treated, two women were referred to the oncology center in Tashkent for highly qualified treatment. More than 34,000 young women and future mothers received anti-anemia pills. According to the laboratory tests, hemoglobin levels were by an average of 10% among all patients enrolled to this activity.
Concluding the visit to Karakalpakstan, representatives of the delegation visited the Medical Institute of Karakalpakstan, to discuss the results of joint activities and promising areas of cooperation.
The UNDP-UNFPA Joint Programme on "Building the resilience of local communities against health, environmental and economic insecurities caused by environmental destruction in the Aral Sea region", funded by the Government of Japan, was launched in December 2019. Among the key tasks of the programme are: 1) improving the quality of medical care in remote rural areas by strengthening their technical and institutional base, and 2) assistance in launching inclusive business initiatives to create sources of income, new jobs, as well as improving access to basic social services, including access to drinking water.

Title: ‘The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence’ Joint Campaign kicks off in Uzbekistan
Content: 22 November 2021
A 16-day joint campaign themed “Together Ending Violence Against Women” was launched, calling for various stakeholders and actors to take prompt actions to end all forms of violence in Uzbekistan.
Organized by the Gender Commission of Uzbekistan, UN system and Delegation of the European Union to Uzbekistan, the kick-off event marked the official start of a series of awareness-raising campaigns, ranging from offline regional events to digital campaigns and was attended by more than 100 participants, including national and international partners, the diplomatic corps, civil society organizations, youth and mass media.
In September 2019, Uzbekistan adopted a Law on Protecting Women from All Forms of Harassment and Violence. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan, from January-September 2021, 29,541 women and girls who had been subjected to harassment and violence received protection orders.
The event participants discussed Uzbekistan’s efforts to strengthen a multi-sectoral response to gender-based-violence (GBV), including service provision for victims and survivors, through Centres of Rehabilitation and Adaptation, and non-governmental shelters.
“It is high time to create a movement for social norm change so that all women and girls will be protected everywhere, and they become one of the key forces driving the social and economic transformation in the new Uzbekistan,” noted Yu Yu, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. UNFPA Representative in Uzbekistan.
Participants have also highlighted challenges and opportunities and emphasized how all stakeholders can effectively collaborate, to strengthen the fight against GBV, provide methods for preventing violence, continue building capacity across all relevant agencies and activist groups and advance their commitments to end violence against women and girls.
Media representatives and bloggers specifically spoke about a role of the media in changing attitudes and dispelling stereotypes around gender-based violence.
Violence against women and girls is a grave violation of human rights. The impact of violence has serious physical, sexual and mental consequences for women and girls. It has damaging affects on women’s general well-being, health, and prevents women from fully participating in society, while being detrimental to the entire family, the community, and the country at large.
The “16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence’’ is an international campaign, held annually since 1991. The campaign begins on the 25th of November with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and runs through to the 10th of December, Human Rights Day – signifying the fact that violence against women is the most pervasive breach of human rights worldwide. This year marks the campaign’s 30th anniversary.

Title: Central Asia’s largest cold chain vaccine facility opens in Uzbekistan
Content: 20 November 2021
Today, on World Children’s Day, UNICEF handed over the Republican Cold Chain Warehouse, the largest vaccine facility in Central Asia, to the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan. The opening of this new facility, which will allow storing large numbers of vaccines with different temperature requirements including ultra-cold temperatures, is a critical step towards a more robust immunization system in the country, which will support the government’s efforts to improve maternal and child health and the overall wellbeing of the country’s population.
“Children's health and disease prevention are among the top priorities of the government of Uzbekistan, so the opening of a warehouse of this scale is very timely,” said Mr. Behzod Musaev, Minister of Health of Uzbekistan. “We expect this warehouse to become a logistics hub for the entire national immunization programme, and to multiply our capacity to supply and manage vaccines. I would like to thank our international partners, and above all UNICEF, for their assistance in strengthening the cold chain system in Uzbekistan”, he added.
The Republican Cold Chain Warehouse can store all kinds of vaccines currently available. It is equipped with three walk-in cold rooms with almost 1,000 m2 (2-8° C) storage capacity, ultracold freezers (3,000 liter capacity), walk-in freezers (40 m3) to store the vaccine supply, as well as 1,000 m2 of dry storage for ancillary immunization supplies. The facility also features electric forklifts, dock shelters, leveling platforms, and lifting mechanisms for quick and efficient cargo management, and is connected to two electric grid mains and fitted with a powerful standby diesel generator, to help ensure an uninterrupted power supply.
“Having a well-functioning supply and cold chain system in place is critical for an efficient national immunization programme”, said Ms. Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia. “UNICEF is pleased to have been able to support the establishment of this facility, which will contribute to the smooth functioning of the entire national supply and cold chain system of Uzbekistan, and serve as an example to other countries in the region,” she added.
Since 2017, UNICEF has supported the construction of a total of 21 vaccine warehouses across Uzbekistan. It has also provided refrigerated trucks, vaccine carriers and cold boxes, as well as staff training and the necessary guidelines and instructions on how to run the facilities.
UNICEF will continue to support the Government of Uzbekistan in strengthening national and local capacities in the management, planning, monitoring and evaluation of supply and cold chain systems, in the framework of the Country Programme of Cooperation for 2021-2025.
Notes to editors:
Over the past four years, UNICEF, with funding support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has supported the strengthening of supply and cold chain systems at both national and local levels in Uzbekistan, including through mobile teams. This has included the provision of:

Title: People and Government of Uzbekistan take action to confront the climate crisis collectively
Content: 01 November 2021
Major strides taken towards a green economy through new ambitious national climate pledges
Although the Republic of Uzbekistan is one of those countries least responsible for the climate crisis, it is facing disproportionate consequences from it.  Projected reductions in water resources and changes in rainfall patterns are expected to lead to long droughts and less water available for irrigation, thus putting significant portions of its population at risk of food insecurity. These water shortages are causing diminishing crop yields that will be insufficient for the country’s fast-growing population. The problem is magnified by the incessant drying of the Aral Sea, which has already lost 57 percent of its area, 80 percent of its volume and 64 percent of its depth over the past four decades.
Conversely, Uzbekistan is taking significant strides towards reducing its carbon footprint through the creation of a green economy. Given its high vulnerability to climate impacts, climate change mitigation and adaptation measures are becoming a high priority for the country. In September 2021, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev reconfirmed Uzbekistan's commitment to achieving the Paris Agreement goals, taking concrete steps to move towards building a carbon neutral economy.
In its second Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Climate Agreement, which was just released this week, Uzbekistan increased its commitments more than 300 percent, with plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP by 35 percent of 2010 levels by 2030, compared to the 10 percent reduction stated in the first NDC. To achieve this ambitious target, the Government plans to, among other actions, increase the share of renewable energy sources to 25 percent of total power generation, double the energy-efficiency indicator relative to the level of 2018, halve the energy intensity of GDP, reduce energy intensity, and decrease industrial consumption of natural resources. To ensure a successful outcome, results-based measurable indicators have been tied to and included in the country’s National Development Goals, the Green Economy Strategy, the Climate Change Strategy, the National Biodiversity Strategy and the Concept for the Development of the Electric Power Industry.
Adaptation measures in the Second NDC cover a wide range of actions to protect communities from the adverse effects of climate change. Some of the main goals are to enhance the resilience of strategic infrastructure and ecosystems, to protect biodiversity, and to reduce the harmful impact of the Aral Sea basin, including through promoting a systems-thinking approach supported by UNDP and the implementation of targeted programmes. It also plans to improve the use of water resources, construct and renovate hydraulic facilities, promote greater crop diversification, introduce organic farming practices, increase the climate resilience of agriculture, reforest mountains foothills, preserve native plant species in semi-deserts and deserts and develop early warning systems for hydrometeorological hazards. To achieve these plans, Uzbekistan intends to strengthen its adaptive capacity, and establish risk management systems at all levels in synergy with mitigation actions.
Implementation strategy
The strategic tools for the implementation of the mitigation and adaptation goals set in the second NDC are already in place or are being introduced.  The transition strategy to a green economy by 2030, which is already in the process of operationalization, was recently intensified to reflect the increase in the country’s national climate pledges. Moreover, activities related to climate change mitigation and adaptation measures are reflected in almost all sectoral strategies, plans and development programmes.
At the same time, institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks are being strengthened in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency to achieve SDGs targets for the year 2030.  Adaptation priorities are reflected in policies and measures in the areas of water resources, energy generation, forest conservation, together with roadmaps for their implementation. In addition, a National Adaptation Plan focused on agriculture, water resources, health, housing, and emergency management is currently in the process of being developed with support from UNDP and with financing from the Green Climate Fund.
The Results are already becoming apparent: the gradual modernization of industries and a number of other measures implemented from 1990 to 2017 have led to a decrease in the energy intensity of GDP by almost 250 percent. Furthermore, specific emissions of CO2 per unit of GDP decreased by nearly 40 percent. This momentum is expected to continue as the country implements its strategy to establish a green economy.
However, the achievement of the long-term objectives in NDC2 is contingent upon support from international organizations and financial institutions. Their support is needed to ensure access to advanced energy-saving and environmentally friendly technologies, and climate financing. One big step in this direction occurred on 19 May when the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the Aral Sea region declaring it a zone of ecological innovations and technologies and committing to promote greater research and scientific efforts to recover the region and improve its environment.
The road ahead: developing a green economy
The Strategy of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Transition to Green Economy for the Period 2019-2030 is to achieve sustainable economic progress sustainably and inclusively, contributing to social development, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, climate and environmental conservation through the integration of the principles of the green economy in the ongoing structural reforms. The Second NDC, which was developed under the guidance and supervision of Uzhydromet and supported by UNDP, is based almost entirely on green economy principles, and integrated with and dependent upon this strategy. In fact, “green economy” is mentioned 17 times in the NDC2.
Aside from the national Green Economy Strategy, the NDC2 is also linked with Uzbekistan’s 16 National Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Even though Uzbekistan is committed to the effective and transparent implementation of all international environmental agreements, success also relies on the capacity and commitment of the world community to make every effort to control carbon emissions in accordance with each country’s capabilities and responsibilities.  While Uzbekistan is ready, willing, able and already active in doing its part, the final outcome will depend on the collective commitments and actions of the global community.
As world leaders gather in Glasgow between 31 October – 12 November 2021 for the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), enhanced global climate action and cooperation has never been more crucial. The people of Uzbekistan and indeed the world are watching.

Title: FAO introduces alternative income-generating activities for rural women
Content: 29 October 2021
Rural women in Bukhara and Navoi provinces have been discovering opportunities to generate new income through participation in workshops on business and craft skills. The workshops were organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) under the Central Asian Desert Initiative (CADI).
«Gender equality and the empowerment of women play an important role in the mandate of our organization. FAO is engaging women in alternative income-generating activities to improve their families' livelihoods, which in turn will reduce their dependence on grazing and other agricultural activities in cold winter deserts. The workshop also facilitates the revival of traditional crafts, because there is always high market demand for such national applied arts products» said Nariman Nishanov, National Coordinator of the CADI project in Uzbekistan.
The workshops were attended by a total of 57 female residents of the village of Chuya in Nurata district, Navoi province and the village Durman in Karakul district, Bukhara province. The classes were conducted by experts in embroidery and traditional crafts. One of them, Matlyuba Bazarova, is Vice–President of the Central Asian Crafts Support Association. She told the participants about the benefits available in the country to support artisans, how to start a business, and also shared her experience and knowledge about the basics of marketing and the creation of home-working jobs.
Over the three days of the workshops, rural women also learned the basics of sewing skills, national embroidery and making wool blankets. Incorporating a national flavour and modern fashion trends, the participants made pillowcases, chapans, jackets, bags and blankets during practical classes. The expert artisan Venera Kalimullina taught them he details of making woollen blankets: checking wool for quality, washing and drying wool, quilting and much more.
«The participants, mostly women, were selected on the basis of a “Temir daftar” list of citizens who need social and economic protection. Let's hope that thanks to the knowledge and skills they have gained, they will now be able to make additional income and improve the well-being of their families», remarked expert artisan Venera Kalimullina.
The areas where the trainings were organized belong to the project territories of the Central Asian Desert Initiative (CADI). This project aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of temperate deserts, which are unique ecosystems of global importance. These deserts are important migration areas for birds as well as for wild ungulates. The target countries of CADI are Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. They bear a special responsibility for the preservation of the temperate deserts, which are threatened by anthropogenic and climatic factors. The CADI project, funded by the German Government, has been being implemented since 2016 by the University of Greifswald, the Michael Succow Foundation and FAO.

Title: Launch of Prevention and Management of Mental Health Conditions in Uzbekistan
Content: 27 October 2021
Today, on 27th October, the WHO Country Office in Uzbekistan, in collaboration with UNDP, United Nations Interagency Task Force on Non communicable diseases (NCD), organized an event dedicated to launching the first "Mental Health Investment Case" in Uzbekistan and the WHO European region.
The intersectoral forum, organized in a mixed virtual format by the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan and 3-levels of WHO, including WHO country office, headquarters and Regional office for Europe and the UNDP team, was attended by a wide range of representatives from Government and non-Government sectors, and the international community.
The mental health investment case report provides an assessment of the current mental health situation in the country, including challenges and opportunities for the development of the mental health system, and also economic evidence on the attributable, preventable burden associated with a number of leading mental, neurological and substance use conditions – psychosis, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, epilepsy and alcohol use disorders.
The report quantifies the costs of mental health conditions to the health sector and the benefits of scaled-up action to the economy at large. It also includes a return on investment (ROI) analysis that compares the costs of mental health conditions in the country with the estimated health and economic returns that implementing a package of cost-effective interventions would have until 2030.
Mental health conditions take a significant toll on the economy and social and sustainable development in Uzbekistan every year. In addition to the health and social impact of these conditions, the investment case model estimates that they caused UZS 4.8 trillion (US$ 495 million) in total economic losses for Uzbekistan in 2019. The Government of Uzbekistan has set protection and enhancement of the population's mental health as one of the most important objectives of the national health policy.
In the opening remarks, Mr. Inoyatov, 1st Deputy Minister of Health, expressed gratitude to the WHO and UNDP team, the Ministry of Health of Russia and the Ambassador of Russia in Uzbekistan for their support in financing the development of such an important study for the country.
The study and development of the report were made possible with the support of the UN interagency task force (UNIATF) for NCD prevention and by the control and generous funding from the Government of the Russian Federation.
In their opening remarks, Dr. Hans Kluge, a Regional Director of WHO/Europe and Svetlana Akselrod from WHO HQ highlighted the importance of embedding Mental Health in the government agenda in Uzbekistan and the intersectionality of the issue. They also congratulated Uzbekistan on becoming a pioneer as the first country to publish this report in the WHO European region, which will encourage the use of the study's findings in future intersectoral policy development and health reform implementation. Hans Kluge also informed the participants that Mental Health is the Flagship priority programme for WHO, and future support for this will be provided from WHO/Europe.
Dr. Lianne Kuppens, WHO Representative and Head of Country Office, highlighted, "As the country continues to reform its health system towards universal health coverage, the Government of Uzbekistan embarked on the current effort to construct an investment case for the mental health system and service development. This comes on the back of the earlier NCD investment case for Uzbekistan in 2017, which provided new context-specific information on the expected benefits of scaled-up delivery of NCD prevention and control efforts."
During the panel discussion, the representatives of the Government of Uzbekistan, Ministries of health, finance, and education, reflected on the study's findings and confirmed their readiness to support the use of the report's recommendations.
The study highlights four key recommendations that Uzbekistan can translate into policy and practice to scale up mental health investment:
NGOs and the international community in Uzbekistan, led by Mr Yu Yu, a.i. UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Matilda Dimovska, also shared their perspectives on future support towards strengthening mental health in Uzbekistan.
The findings of the investment case demonstrate that investing in evidence-based, cost-effective mental health interventions would, over the period until 2030, save more than 2,600 lives and provide economic benefits. Strengthening policy and increasing interest in mental health is a primary goal for public health and sustainable development and can help Uzbekistan reduce the burden of mental health conditions.

Title: Westminster International University in Tashkent and UN system in Uzbekistan celebrate 76th anniversary of the United Nations
Content: 21 October 2021
The UN’s 76th anniversary was celebrated in Uzbekistan with an event organised by Westminster International University (WIUT) in Tashkent and the country’s UN system.
The event was held at WIUT’s campus and was attended by more than 300 participants, including national and international partners, organisations, youth, representatives of the UN agencies, funds and programmes based in Uzbekistan, as well as students and academic staff from the University.
In his UN Day address, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres commented that that the values that have powered the UN Charter for the last 76 years — peace, development, human rights, and opportunity for all — have no expiry date.
The joint event aimed to reaffirm joint commitments by the UN system and WIUT to advance the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by youth in Uzbekistan, present practical ways to attain the SDGs and build a community of SDGs’ change makers amongst students and youth networks.

“WIUT, as a member of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN), is fully committed to promoting activities and events, and discovering new prospects for the SDGs in Uzbekistan. Universities and youth play a key role in sustainable development”, noted Bakhrom Mirkasimov, Rector, Westminster International University in Tashkent, in his opening remarks.
Addressing event participants, Munir Mammadzade, UN Resident Coordinator a.i., UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan, remarked “Youth can play a critical role in advancing the sustainable development goals and it is important that youth are informed and engaged with the global vision for the future though participation in various platforms for discussions, exchange of ideas and innovation.”

Divided into 16 teams and  based on Uzbekistan’s 16 national sustainable development goals, students presented their respective goals to participants, highlighted problems and proposed actionable solutions for sustainable development, eradicating inequality and other deprivation, to leave no one behind.
The event participants and students exchanged views and discussed how to improve awareness of the national Sustainable Development Goals among students and universities across Uzbekistan.
Today, worldwide, there are 1.2 billion young people aged 15 to 24 years, accounting for 16 per cent of the global population. The active engagement of youth in sustainable development efforts is central to achieving sustainable, inclusive, and stable societies by the target date, and to averting the worst threats and challenges to sustainable development, including the impacts of climate change, unemployment, poverty, gender inequality, conflict, and migration.

Title: UNHCR opens alternative route of aid to Afghanistan via Uzbekistan
Content: 15 October 2021
Today, an emergency airlift by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, landed in Termez, Uzbekistan. The flight is part of UNHCR’s aid effort to Afghanistan and a massive operation to provide life-saving aid to the people of Afghanistan.
This and subsequent airlifts through Termez will deliver more than 100 metric tonnes of core relief items urgently needed to help Afghans prepare for the winter. Until trucked into Afghanistan, the consignments will be stored in Termez Cargo Centre.
“We would like to thank the Government of Uzbekistan for its cooperation in providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. We believe this new route of aid delivery will contribute to global efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and to help millions of people affected by it,” said Mr. Dumitru Lipcanu, UNHCR Deputy Representative for Central Asia, today in Termez.
Termez Cargo Centre is located less than two kilometres from the border of Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. Thanks to its location, size and capacity as well as services available, the Centre is seen as a critical hub for providing assistance to Afghan people.
UNHCR, part of the UN country team in Uzbekistan, stays committed to helping Afghan people together with partners. Additional support from states, the private sector and international community is critical to responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, where more than 3.5 million people are currently internally displaced, including more than half a million since the beginning of the year.

Title: FAO hands over special vehicles to forestry organizations in Uzbekistan
Content: 10 October 2021
– The FAO Representation in Uzbekistan handed over special off-road vehicles to Pop, Dehkanabad and Kitab forestry organizations, within the framework of the project “Sustainable Forest Management in Mountain and Valley Areas of Uzbekistan”. This project is implemented by FAO in cooperation with the State Committee on Forestry of the Republic of Uzbekistan, funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
"Within the framework of the project, an inventory of forest plantations and the creation of electronic maps using satellite navigation systems are planned in the mountainous territories of Pop, Kitab and Dehkanabad districts. Electronic maps with a constant, real-time update system will make it possible to instantly correct planned activities, significantly save budget funds and conduct high-quality monitoring of forest areas. Special off-road vehicles will solve the issue of transportation in hard-to-reach mountain regions when performing these tasks", said Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan.
The FAO / GEF project "Sustainable Forest Management in Mountain and Valley Areas of Uzbekistan" is being implemented in four districts which represent the different types of forest ecosystems in Uzbekistan –Syrdarya, Dekhkanabad, Kitab and Pop State Forest Organizations. In these regions, FAO is working on sustainable forest management, the creation of information systems and electronic maps of forest areas and the widespread involvement of the local population in the forest management process.
"During the implementation of the project throughout the period 2018-2021, the FAO Representation in Uzbekistan has done large-scale work",  says the technical coordinator of the project Olimjon Kakhkharov. “For example, the Data centre and the GIS laboratory were established, which are equipped with advanced technological and modern equipment, field inventory and a total budget of USD $400,000 with which to further improve the inventory process of the State Forest Fund. Four greenhouses were built, for the cultivation of ornamental and forest plants using resource-saving technologies. Four tractors worth USD $100,000 were also handed over to forest organizations for technical support.”
As part of the vehicle transfer ceremony, 20 forestry specialists were awarded with certificates to recognise their great energy, diligence and professionalism during the implementation of the project.

Title: FAO donates modern agricultural equipment to rural households in Bukhara region
Content: 28 September 2021
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is continuing to provide socio-economic support to rural people within the framework of the CACILM-2 project (Integrated Natural Resources Management in Drought-prone and Salt-affected Agricultural Production Landscapes in Central Asia and Turkey) which is funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). In Uzbekistan, the project is being implemented with cooperation and strong support from the Ministry of Agriculture.
FAO Representation in Uzbekistan has sent modern agricultural equipment to Bukhara province, including ten pit drills, ten knapsack sprayers and ten water pumps.
“One of the project’s important tasks is assisting the development of rural households for more efficient use of land, and to provide higher incomes for rural people. For this purpose, new equipment was donated to smallholders in Bukhara province. The beneficiaries were selected on the recommendation of the local khokimiyat (administration of the district)”, said national project manager Mukhammadjon Kosimov.



Pit drills are designed for drilling holes in the ground, and greatly facilitate work on personal plots. This new equipment will make it possible to mechanize the process of planting seedlings, saving time and resources.
Knapsack sprayers will be used primarily for the chemical treatment of plants. Due to their portability and lightness, they are easy to use and make it easier to control the pests and diseases that affect plants.
The use of water pumps will contribute to guaranteeing a water supply for personal plots.
Soon, within the framework of the project, more similar agricultural equipment will be delivered and donated to smallholders in the Kamashi district of Kashkadarya province.
The overall objective of CACILM-2 is to scale up integrated natural resources management (INRM) in drought-prone and salt-affected agricultural production landscapes in the Central Asian countries and Turkey. In Uzbekistan, this project is being jointly implemented with the Ministry of Agriculture. The outcomes of this project will also contribute towards the aims of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Title: ILO – Uzbekistan cooperation is on track: Decent Work Country Programme for 2021-2025 signed
Content: 22 September 2021
Today the International Labour Organization (ILO) and its constituents in Uzbekistan – Government, employers’ and workers’ organizations – signed a Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) for 2021-2025.
In opening the signing ceremony, Olga Koulaeva, Director of the ILO Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, noted that this is the second Decent Work Country Programme for Uzbekistan. The first one, signed in 2014 and extended in 2017, initially was focused on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and forced labour. Now when the progress achieved by Uzbekistan in these areas has been registered and recognized, the new DWCP covers a broader range of development issues.

The programme sets out to improve the regulatory framework governing labour relations; enhance decent work and better employment opportunities for youth, women and vulnerable groups, generated by inclusive and equitable economic growth; extend the access of the most vulnerable groups to equitable, inclusive and quality education and social protection; strengthen social dialogue and the institutional capacities of the social partners.

Tanzila Narbaeva, Chairperson of the Senate of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan who has been involved from the very inception of Uzbekistan’s cooperation with the ILO, welcomed the new Decent Work Country Programme. Today, Uzbekistan implements wide-ranging reforms aimed at enhancing a democratic State and guaranteeing the rights of people, including their right to decent work. Ms Narbaeva particularly noted the role of social dialogue. She also made reference to the Global Call to Action for a human-centred recovery from the COVID-19 crisis  adopted by the International Labour Conference in 2021.

Heinz Koller, Assistant ILO Director-General and Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia noted that DWCPs “allowed Uzbekistan to make rapid and significant progress towards Decent Work objectives”. “Our cooperation is definitely on track”, he said.

Nozim Khusanov, Minister for Employment and Labour Relations, described recent developments in the social and labour sphere, including the revised Law on the Employment of the Population, the National Employment strategy, National Social Protection strategy till 2030. A review of the employment promotion system was also initiated, including the reform of public employment centres, the establishment of the State Labour Inspectorate and a national system for the assessment of qualifications. Nozim Khusanov thanked the ILO for its technical assistance provided in these areas.

Kudratulla Rafikov, Chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Uzbekistan, expressed his active support for the new programme. It will contribute to the implementation of the fundamental reforms and to the creation of a new Uzbekistan, he said.

Ilkhom Khaidarov, Chairman of the Confederation of Employers of Uzbekistan, particularly noted the role of the Decent Work Country Programme for employers who are now following principles of decent work thus getting broader access to world markets.

Yu Yu, United Nations Resident Coordinator a.i., called the new programme “one of the milestones for the UN in Uzbekistan”. DWCP is closely aligned with the national development priorities and the national reform agenda as reflected in the new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2021-25.

The DWCP signing ceremony was held online.

Title: UNHCR for Central Asia announces the Second Regional Statelessness Competition for Students - “Impact of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness”
Content: 21 September 2021
The Representation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for Central Asia jointly with the Al-Farabi Kazakh National University and the Central Asian Network on Statelessness (CANS) announces the Second Regional Statelessness Competition for Students - “Impact of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness”
Background and context
Millions of people around the world are denied a nationality and the legal rights endowed with it. They do not exist on paper and most often live on the fringes of society. Without citizenship, stateless people often do not have access to essential services, including healthcare. At such a critical time, in the middle of a global pandemic, they are at great risk of being left behind in the response. Stateless people may be precluded from or face obstacles in accessing coronavirus testing and treatment, others may refrain from accessing services for fear that their legal status can put them at risk of detention or deportation.
Without legal rights and access to services, statelessness leaves many politically and economically marginalized, discriminated against and vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. In many countries across the world, stateless people live in sub-standard and inadequate sanitary conditions which can compound the risk of outbreaks. Limited by their legal status, many work in informal sectors, which can also hamper adherence to public health protocols such as self- isolation and physical distancing.
Although it has long been understood that statelessness should be avoided and that this goal can only be achieved through international cooperation, many States have yet to take action to ensure that everyone enjoys the right to a nationality. Due to the differing approaches taken by States with regard to the acquisition and loss of nationality, some individuals continue to “fall through the cracks” and become stateless. Common rules are therefore essential to address such gaps. The 1961 Convention is the only universal instrument that elaborates clear, detailed and concrete safeguards to ensure a fair and appropriate response to the threat of statelessness.
2021 marks 60 years since the adoption of the 1961 Convention. To mark this date, UNHCR invites secondary school and university students share their essays and research papers on the impact of the 1961 Convention and its relevance today.
Objective of the Research Paper Competition

Title: FAO helps to rebuild a well in arid district of Kashkadarya region
Content: 17 September 2021
According to experts, overuse of pastures, as well as undergrazing, have a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, it is important to place drinking wells for livestock evenly throughout the area.
However, many wells in desert and semi-desert pastures have become unusable over time, and their restoration is a rather difficult and costly process for shepherds.
The FAO/GEF regional project Integrated Natural Resources Management in Drought-prone and Salt-affected Agricultural Production Systems in Central Asia and Turkey (CACILM2) aided the renovation of a well located near the village of Takham, Guzar district, Kashkadarya region, which in turn provided a great support for local livestock breeders.
The population of the Takham village is about 1.5 thousand people. The arid climate has made livestock the only source of income for the local community.
In total, karakul breeders keep more than 3 thousand sheep. The mentioned well is the only source of water used for agricultural purposes in this settlement. The repair work took more than two months. Today, when the well is operational, shepherds can receive up to 40 cubic meters of water per day.
“First of all, it will be possible to use previously unused pastures, therefore, the load on other areas for grazing livestock will be reduced. Effective grazing management on pastures not only ensures sustainability, animal health and productivity, all of which impact cost of production, it also benefits the pasture ecosystem”, - national project manager Mukhammadjon Kosimov states.
Local residents were very happy with the launch of the new well. They gained confidence in the future.
“This is a great help for us,” says Otabek Ismatov, director of Guzor Korakulchilik LLC. “Our farm is engaged in karakul breeding, we supply precious karakul skins, as well as meat and wool. The farm has 86,000 hectares of land and more than 40,000 head of livestock. From now on, we have big plans, we will increase the number of sheep and develop the economy”.
The overall objective of the CACILM-2 is to scale up integrated natural resources management (INRM) in drought-prone and salt-affected agricultural production landscapes in the Central Asian countries and Turkey. In Uzbekistan this project is being implemented jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture. The implementation of this project also contributes to the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Title: Alwaleed Philanthropies from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the First Philanthropic Organization to Contribute to the United Nations Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund
Content: 30 August 2021
Solidifying its Commitment to the Communities of the Aral Sea Region
Alwaleed Philanthropies, a philanthropic organization chaired by HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud and based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has a mission to help alleviate suffering and transcend international borders. With the belief that it is vital to create safe environments around the world where humanity can flourish, the Alwaleed Philanthropies values the importance of addressing human development globally. In support of this value, the Alwaleed Philanthropies partners with the United Nations Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region in Uzbekistan (MPHSTF) and made a generous contribution of USD 200,000 to the Fund in May 2021.
“With the mounting problems of understanding, equity, poverty, and disasters facing the world, the challenges confronting all charitable institutions will become ever more daunting. With a proven history of creating positive change, Alwaleed Philanthropies continue[s] to face the world’s most pressing issues with unwavering dedication, commitment, and intelligence,” said HRH Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud, Chairman of Alwaleed Philanthropies. With this, the Alwaleed Philanthropies made history as the first private philanthropic organization to make financial contributions to the MPHSTF. This generous gesture is a testament to Alwaleed’s unfaltering support to overcoming the world’s gravest problems and illuminating that the greatest threats can only be achieved through a unified human involvement and responsibility. The new strategy of the Alwaleed Philanthropies focuses on environment and innovations, which is consistent with the MPHSTF’s priority areas and fully supports the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals in the Aral Sea Region.
The UN in Uzbekistan recognizes the trailblazing and benevolent initiative of Alwaleed Philanthropies towards the sustainable development in the Aral Sea Region. Mr. Yu Yu, UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan, ad interim, noted that the partnership between Alwaleed Philanthropies and the UN in Uzbekistan supports a collective and clear path towards solution and value creation to sustainable development. Further, Mr. Yu added, “Alwaleed serve as a paradigm for other development partners to reinforce joint and collective initiatives in the Aral Sea Region.”
With Alwaleed Philanthropies’ partnership with the MPHSTF, the UN is confident that broader sets of solutions will reach the vulnerable groups in the Aral Sea Region including women, youth, children, and the elderly. The support from Alwaleed combined with contributions from the Governments of Uzbekistan, Norway, Finland, Republic of Korea, and the European Union will allow the MPHSTF to support more programmes that are also responsive to the needs of the people of the Aral Sea Region. It will also enable the MPHSTF to sharpen its focus on the impacts of and solutions to the triple planetary crisis ─ climate, nature, pollution ─ in the Aral Sea Region.

Title: Uzbekistan ministries trained in leveraging private capital to support country’s development
Content: 19 August 2021
Training follows recent issuance of SDG bond on London Stock Exchange
TASHKENT, 19 August 2021: The United Nations Development Programme trained more than 60 representatives from 15 ministries this week at a two-day online seminar geared to optimize the opportunities afforded by international private capital for the public good. The instruction comes in the wake of the 2 July issuance of Uzbekistan’s Sovereign Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Bond, which is expected to facilitate investments from private funds to finance public SDG-oriented programmes.
UNDP widely supports this initiative of Uzbekistan and has been working closely with the Government of Uzbekistan to better align its issuance of sovereign bonds with the SDGs, and to better ensure the transparency and accountability of public borrowing.
Akhadbek Khaydarov, Deputy minister of finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan said that: “we will apply this approach to other projects financed by State budget and external borrowings in the future. In this sense, we firmly believe that these trainings will help us to build appropriate capacity in working with ESG and SDG-linked financial instruments and serve as a cornerstone for future development and SDG projects”.
During the workshop, ministry participants learnt about Uzbekistan’s SDG Bonds Framework, and how proceeds can be tracked, allocated, and managed in line with internationally-recognized standards. The training also included different dimensions of sustainable development within the context of a Green Economy. The International Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) principles for market compliance were covered in detail.
Chris Smith, Co-Head and Managing Director EMEA - Bankers without Boundaries said that building capacity and knowledge of the Sustainable Development Goal Bond Framework and how it will function is critical to its implementation. “The attendance from such a wide range of ministry attendees is a clear demonstration of the intent of Uzbekistan to make progress against the SDGs” – he said.
The workshop was organized under the UN’s Joint Programme on Establishing an Integrated National Financing Framework for Sustainable Development in Uzbekistan (INFF), funded by the Joint SDG Fund, which was established by the UN Secretary-General to work across all 17 global goals to transform development practices by incentivizing and enabling new and innovative development approaches.
Background
The Joint SDG Fund aims to support Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams to partner with Governments in order to stimulate uptake of integrated and transformative policies leading to the creation of smart financing strategies that put SDG progress into high gear at global, regional, and country levels. It was formed with contributions of the following donor countries: Denmark, EU, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Title: Key principles of gender-responsive budgeting were discussed in Uzbekistan
Content: 27 July 2021
The United Nations Join Programme Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan conducted the sixth on line webinar addressing gender equality.
The United Nations Join Programme Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan conducted the sixth on line webinar addressing gender equality. This time members of the Uzbek parliament, government agencies and ILO’s social partners got acquainted with the concept of gender-responsive budgeting, tools and international practices  and discussed the ways of it can be applied into the budget and policy-making process in Uzbekistan.
The webinar offered comprehensive insight of the concept of gender-responsive budgeting and international practices and tools based on collective experiences of UN Women, International Labour Organisation, UNICEF and UNDP. According to UN Women Gender-responsive budgeting (GRB) is an approach to systematically integrate gender equality objectives into government policy, planning, budgeting, monitoring, evaluation, and audit. It does not mean simply developing a separate budget for women. It is a comprehensive policy that also includes the collection and allocation of public resources to empower both women and men by considering diversity of their rights, needs,  interests, educational, geographical, ethnic, income and dis/ability backgrounds  throughout the lifecycle and minimising negative aspects of gender inequality.
Currently, Uzbekistan is developing three major strategies until 2030 on social protection, employment, and poverty reduction. It is important to mainstream gender equality  in these strategies to ensure that no one is left behind. It is gratifying to observe increased attention to existing gender problems in Uzbekistan that has translated into two laws specifically targeting gender equality. These thoughts were shared in the welcoming speech of Ms Gulnora Marufova, First Deputy Minister of Makhalla and Family Support and the member of Gender Commission under the Senate of Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan. She also expressed her confidence that capacity building activities on GRB would help to improve the quality of legal acts and promote gender equality in Uzbekistan.
Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr Jamshid Abruev shared the progress of collaboration with international development agencies in promoting gender equality. Particularly in the field of GRB, the Ministry of Finance is developing an action plan with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank. This action plan will enable the Ministry of Finance and other line ministries to integrate gender equality principles in their budgeting processes.
Gender audit, analysis of gender issues based on sex-disaggregated data are an inherent component of GRB. Academia and research centres play a vital role in providing the evidence base for tailoring policies. Ms Victoria Alexeyeva, Deputy Director of Ijtimoiy Fikr Research Center, highlighted research projects on gender issues conducted by the centre she leads and how this think tank was supporting the government in tackling genderbased inequalities.
In her presentation, Ms Margarita Ozonas Marcos, ILO International consultant, shared the main principles of GRB,  and illustrated its importance using real-life examples. She also explained key tools and methods of GRB and the role each government agency and civil society organisation play in the successful introduction of this approach in the policy-making process.
The presentation was followed by brief polls to help the participants to assess their learning. In the Q&A session, the participants discussed models of GRB in different countries and the ways of its integration in Uzbekistan.

Title: SILVERLEAFE Joins the United Nations Global Compact as the First from the Agro-Industry Sector in Uzbekistan
Content: 19 July 2021
Silverleafe, LLC (Silverleafe), an Uzbek-American joint venture providing an innovative model of mechanized agricultural clusters since 2018, has joined the United Nations (UN) Global Compact initiative— a voluntary leadership platform launched in 2000 for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices.
Silverleafe, LLC (Silverleafe), an Uzbek-American joint venture providing an innovative model of mechanized agricultural clusters since 2018, has joined the United Nations (UN) Global Compact initiative— a voluntary leadership platform launched in 2000 for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices.
On 14 July 2021, Silverleafe became the first organization in Uzbekistan from the agro-business industry to become a member of the United Nations Global Compact. Silverleafe, established in 2018, mainly operates in the areas of agriculture, irrigation, and textiles. In the last three years, Silverleafe has played an important role to modernize agricultural reforms in Uzbekistan with the introduction of new technology as well as digitalization of agricultural data. Particularly, their contribution to improving the efficiency of cotton cultivation, a major industry in Uzbekistan, has been significant. Silverleafe is also a strong advocate to promote women’s empowerment, as evidenced by the launch of the Silverleafe Women’s Fund for Innovation and Development last year. Furthermore, they have proactively engaged in various community initiatives including public safety projects and child oncology support and championing the private sector’s role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals and its national targets in Uzbekistan’s agro-industry.
Dan Patterson, General Director of Silverleafe, said that “Silverleafe’s participation in the UN Global Compact is a re-affirmation of our commitment to conduct operations with the highest standards of business ethics, respect for human rights and its resolution to improving and protecting the lives of individuals in its local, regional and national communities.” Silverleafe’s standards as set forth in its Code of Conduct apply to all facilities that produce goods for Silverleafe or any of its subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, contractors, or agents. These standards are based on internationally accepted labor standards and guidelines outlined by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Mr. Patterson continued that “our participation in the UN Global Compact is a key milestone to contribute to climate positive and resilient agricultural innovation ensuring sustainable value chain.”
The UN in Uzbekistan recognizes the laudable steps that Silverleafe has taken to take part in the reforms in the country. As the first for-profit business organization from the agro-business industry to sign up as a member of the UN Global Compact, Silverleafe is indeed an innovator. Ms. Helena Fraser, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan noted that “Silverleafe’s progressive actions paved the way for other organizations to break the old stereotypes regarding the investment climate in Uzbekistan. Through its vision-mission and code of conduct, Silverleafe has been an epitome on how to be a sustainable development catalyst at local, national, and global levels.”
The UN in Uzbekistan stands ready to partner with the private sector and businesses in incorporating sustainability principles and facilitate the dialogue between interested business organizations to drive change in business behavior and help drive the country’s sustainability agenda and national development goals. Ms. Fraser continued that, “together, the UN and the private sector can combine and capitalize on its comparative strengths and resources to deliver the much needed and meaningful results to the present and future generations.”

Title: Advisory Committee on sustainable development of the Aral Sea Region gains momentum
Content: 08 July 2021
The Third Meeting of the Advisory Committee on sustainable development of the Aral Sea Region in Uzbekistan was held on 8 July 2021 in a virtual format. The meeting was organized by the United Nations in Uzbekistan together with the Ministry of Investments and Foreign Trade (MIFT) of Uzbekistan with the participation of relevant ministries and departments, as well as representatives of international and public organizations and the private sector.
The Advisory Committee operates with the support of three Working Groups. In particular, the Visibility Working Group endorsed the Terms of Reference and adopted the Work Plan for 2021. Within its framework, participation, co-organization of international events such as participation to the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), are planned with the direct engagement of the Government, the UN, and relevant stakeholders.
Through the series of workshop sessions of the Working Group on Sustainable Investments from February to July 2021, collective thinking methodology was applied to identify six integrated issues such as land and scarce resources, demographic shifts, persistent cultural norms, changes in industry, education and workforce misalignment, and governance of infrastructure in the Aral Sea region. Thus, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Uzbekistan, in cooperation with partners, is constructing systems interventions or systemic responses to systemic challenges. As a result, the Group was able to develop high-impact proposals.
The Technical Group on Data and Assessments led by UNDP provides evidence and rationale for portfolio analysis and investments in the Aral Sea region. The team of international experts has been mapping the data available in different sources. The mapped data has been categorized in three groups: (i) available and accessible; (ii) available, but inaccessible; and (iii) unavailable and inaccessible. Data Repository is one of the key milestones of the Group so far.
The socio-economic portrait and 2030 forecast scenarios for Karakalpakstan have been presented by UNDP. Socio-economic trends for the last decades and 2030 forecast scenarios have been analyzed and shared with the participants. It was concluded that Karakalpakstan has benefitted from significant investments and resource transfers and made progress in catching up with the rest of Uzbekistan in terms of per-capita income, agricultural production, and access to basic services. Meanwhile, progress is evident relatively to a lesser extent in some other areas, such as employment growth, social protection systems, and poverty reduction.
The Government of Uzbekistan presented the draft of the Integrated Roadmap. The purpose of the Integrated Roadmap is the implementation of the UN Resolution, which will lead to the sustainable improvement of the living conditions and livelihoods of people in the Aral Sea region of Uzbekistan, as well as the restoration of an active ecosystem and enhancement of biodiversity in the surrounding areas. The integrated roadmap of program measures for the cohesive development of the Aral Sea region will:
Ms. Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative, underscored that “The Integrated Roadmap is informed by the systems approach, and its implementation shall also be guided by such approach, which necessitates the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders within the Working Groups to bring transformative changes in support of the sustainable development of the Aral Sea region. UNDP stands ready to support the implementation process, as well.”
In his turn, Mr. Atsushi Suda, Deputy Chief of Mission of the Japanese Embassy in Uzbekistan, stated that Japan appreciates the draft of the Roadmap since it is more comprehensive and reflects clear expected outputs. Mr. Suda noted that Japan has contributed to the Resolutions aimed at environmental restoration for more than 25 years. About USD 10 million was injected into 26 grant assistance grassroots projects to improve health and tackle salinization in rural areas.
To summarize, Ms. Helena Fraser, UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan, and Co-chair of the Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund Steering (MPHSTF) Committee welcomed inputs on the Integrated Roadmap to be further endorsed by the Government. She said, ”The Roadmap is a first step to realizing the UN General Assembly Resolution on declaring the Aral Sea as a zone of innovations and technologies and also as the next step in our collective efforts to accelerate joint action on addressing Aral Sea issues and ensure sustainable, data-driven, and evidence-based impact”.
For information
The Advisory Committee on sustainable development of the Aral Sea region was launched on 1 December 2020 under the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea region in Uzbekistan to serve as a single platform for accelerating sustainable development in the Aral Sea region.

Title: UNICEF and Ministry for Support of Mahalla and Family launched trainings for mahalla representatives
Content: 07 July 2021
The United Nations Children’s Fund in partnership with the Ministry for Support of Mahalla and Family of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and the Republican Center for the Social Adaptation of Children conducted training  sessions for staff from the social services department of the Hokimiyat, representatives from the Ministry for Support of Mahalla and Family of the Republic of Uzbekistan, as well as for other social service workers, whose role includes supporting families with children.
The training sessions were conducted within the framework of the UN Joint Program on Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan. The program aims to support the Uzbek government in developing a national social protection strategy, an effective mechanism for interagency interaction and social protection, as well as improving social protection for people with disabilities.
“Management and mahalla workers who have acquired knowledge and skills in the provision of social services according to case management standards, will be able to provide qualified assistance to vulnerable families, especially families with children, to overcome difficult life situations caused by poverty, unemployment, disability, the consequences of labour migration and domestic violence. During the training sessions, staff members learned the toolkit for case management, and had the opportunity to apply their learning in practice in assessing families and developing plans for their withdrawal from a difficult life situation in two pilot regions,” said Tulinoy Kadirova, Chief Specialist of the Department for Strengthening Family Values of the Ministry for Support of Family and Mahalla.
The training sessions were designed to familiarize social services sector managers and the chairmen of mahallas in the pilot districts with the goals and objectives of the project, the concept of providing social services based on case management standards, and effective methods and approaches in social services. During the training sessions, managers discussed their roles in the provision of social work, and the importance of supporting and developing social work skills among professionals working directly with families. Moreover, the training sessions familiarized the administrations of districts and mahalla with the project opportunities its approach and expected results.
In June this year, the Ministry for Support of Mahalla and Family of the Republic of Uzbekistan, together with UNICEF, launched a pilot project to provide integrated social services based on case management principles. The project began with a 9-day training course for specialists from the mahalla committees of the Almazar district of Tashkent city and Angren city of the Tashkent region, whose responsibilities include social work with families. The training sessions aimed at educating and supporting social work professionals working with the most vulnerable groups of the population, such as people with low incomes, people with disabilities, families with children and women. Participants acquired skills in preventative work and direct services to support families and children, reduce poverty and discrimination, facilitate access to essential services, promote social justice, and prevent violence, abuse, exploitation and family separation.
The training sessions were conducted in an interactive format, which allowed 50 participants to discuss the current situation in the field of family support including themes such as: the workload of specialists, working conditions, training prospects, and the knowledge and skills necessary for effective and high quality work with families in difficult life situations. Feedback showed that the training participants had successfully mastered the content of the program, and were now in a position to provide services to the population with a new approach.
The UN Joint Programme, sponsored by the Joint SDG Fund and implemented by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) jointly with the Government of Uzbekistan, aims to support the Government in building and delivering a high-quality social protection system that offers all citizens of Uzbekistan – in particular, those at risk of being left behind – income security and social support throughout their lives.

Title: Next 18 months seen as pivotal in global efforts to reverse punishing pandemic impacts and boost actions to achieve key goals
Content: 06 July 2021
More countries and communities are recognizing the need to bolster efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in light of the toll the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on people around the world according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2021, released by the United Nations today.
The decisions and actions taken during the next 18 months will determine whether pandemic recovery plans will put the world on a course to reach the globally agreed-upon goals that aim to boost economic growth and social well-being while protecting the environment.
According to the report, which tracks global efforts to achieve the SDGs, COVID-19 has caused a major disruption to people’s lives and livelihoods. While progress to achieve the SDGs had been slow even before the pandemic struck, an additional 119-124 million people were pushed back into poverty in 2020. An equivalent of 255 million full-time jobs were lost, and the number of people suffering from hunger, which was already climbing before the pandemic, may have increased by 83-132 million.
The pandemic has exposed and intensified inequalities within and among countries. As of 17 June 2021, around 68 vaccines were administered for every 100 people in Europe and Northern America compared with fewer than 2 in sub-Saharan Africa. Up to 10 million more girls will be at risk of child marriage as a result of the pandemic over the next decade. The collapse of international tourism disproportionally affects Small Island Developing States.
The economic slowdown in 2020 had done little to slow the climate crisis. Concentrations of major greenhouse gases continued to increase, while the global average temperature was about 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to the 1.5°C limit established in the Paris Agreement.
Global flows of foreign direct investment fell by 40% in 2020 compared to 2019. The pandemic has brought immense financial challenges, especially for developing countries – with a significant rise in debt distress.
The 2030 Agenda, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Goals, to improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.
According to the Report, to get the SDGs back on track, governments, cities, business and industries have to use the recovery to adopt low-carbon, resilient and inclusive development pathways that will reduce carbon emissions, conserve natural resources, create better jobs, advance gender equality and tackle growing inequities.
“We are at a critical juncture in human history. The decisions and actions we take today will have momentous consequences for future generations,” said Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General of the | United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “Lessons learned from the pandemic will help us rise to current and future challenges. Let us seize the moment together to make this a decade of action, transformation and restoration to achieve the SDGs and make good on the Paris Climate Agreement.”
Efforts to confront the pandemic have also shown immense community resilience, decisive action from governments, a rapid expansion of social protection, an acceleration of digital transformation; and a unique collaboration to develop life-saving vaccines and treatments in record time. According to the Report, these are solid foundations to build on to accelerate progress on the SDGs.
Some additional key facts and figures:
· The global extreme poverty rate rose for the first time since 1998, from 8.4% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020.
· Between 1 February and 31 December 2020, Governments around the world announced more than 1,600 social protection measures, mostly short-term, in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
· Pandemic-related shocks are likely to trigger a rise in stunting, which already affects more than one in five children.
· The pandemic has halted or reversed progress in health and poses major threats beyond the disease itself. About 90% of countries are still reporting one or more disruptions to essential health services.
· The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on schooling is a ‘generational catastrophe.’ An additional 101 million children and youth fell below the minimum reading proficiency level, wiping out the education gains achieved over the last two decades.
· The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected progress towards gender equality: violence against women and girls has intensified; child marriage is expected to increase; and women have suffered a disproportionate share of job losses and increased care work at home.
· 759 million people remained without electricity and one third of the global population lacked clean cooking fuels and technologies in 2019.
· An economic recovery is under way, led by China and the United States, but for many other countries, economic growth is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2022 or 2023.
· The world fell short on 2020 targets to halt biodiversity loss and 10 million hectares of forest being lost each year between 2015-2020.
· While net official development assistance increased in 2020 to a total of $161 billion, this still falls well short of what is needed to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and to meet the long-established target of 0.7% of GNI.
· In 2020, 132 countries and territories reported that they were implementing a national statistical plan, with 84 having plans that were fully funded. Only 4 out of the 46 LDCs reported having fully funded national statistical plans.
According to the Report, the recovery effort will also depend on the availability of data to inform policy making. Ensuring sufficient funding is available for data collection, both through the mobilization of international and domestic resources, will be critical to these efforts.

Title: The United Nations in Uzbekistan and the Ministry of Agriculture Convened the National and Sub-National Food Systems Sustainability Dialogues ''Coming Together for Sustainable Food Systems in Uzbekistan''
Content: 29 June 2021
With support from the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office (RCO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Ministry of Agriculture served as the national convenor in four key dialogues. The first dialogue on 26 May was in Tashkent. The two subsequent sub-national dialogues were in Nukus on 9 June and in Namangan on 17 June. The dialogues culminated in Tashkent on 29 June 2021.
While focusing on the five key global thematic areas of ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all; shifting to sustainable consumption patterns; boosting nature-positive production; advancing equitable livelihoods; and building resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks, and stress, the national and sub-national dialogues in Uzbekistan framed the discussions around the challenges and also the opportunities that the triple planetary crisis bring to the food systems.
At the concluding dialogue on 29 June, Ms. Helena Fraser, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan said, “the transformation of the food systems at the national and local levels paves the way to change course and make progress towards the national and global sustainable development targets and goals, respectively. The food systems sustainability dialogues afforded a platform for the active involvement of all key stakeholders and their articulation of how to better integrate health, nutrition, climate change action, biodiversity conservation, and pollution reduction in the way we shape food production and consumption.”
Ms. Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan, noted that “the dialogues offered one of the most dynamic ways to engage stakeholders in considering their role in food systems, how their roles link with others, and how they can unite around transformative actions in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”
A wide array of participants from the agricultural sector, including those involved in the production and marketing of crops, fish, and livestock contributed to the dialogue. In addition to government participation, there were also representations from the academic sector, financial services, and the food industry. These participants together with small, medium, and large-scale artisans and business stakeholders as well as from the donor community committed to discussing food systems challenges and exploring a new narrative about a systemic way of looking at food from various sectoral perspectives.
“The dialogues provide an inclusive and supportive venue for debate, consensus-building, and shared commitment making,” some farmer participants in the series of dialogues mentioned. Other sectoral stakeholders said, “[the dialogues] promote trust and increase motivation to hold ourselves accountable for commitments made with mechanisms in place to uphold this accountability.”
In the final dialogue, international donor organizations in Uzbekistan including the European Union (EU), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) reconfirmed their commitment to support agriculture and food industries in Uzbekistan. USAID will introduce innovative business management practices and co-finance investments in new technologies to support farmers and agribusinesses to produce and add value to safe, quality, and environmentally-sound agricultural products. JICA, on the other hand, intends to launch the development of innovative climate resilient technologies for monitoring controlling of water use efficiency on crop productivity in the Aral Sea Region. Mr. Francois Begeot, Head of Cooperation Unit of the European Union Delegation in Uzbekistan, said “the EU remains keen to support government reforms for greener and more sustainable agricultural sector that is climate responsive.”
The concluding dialogue consolidated country-level commitments and actions to shape the pathway to sustainable national food systems for the coming decade. Uzbekistan’s Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Kakhramon Yuldashev,highlighted that “it is expected that the process of multi-stakeholder dialogue will continue in the country even after the culmination of the global Food Systems Summit in September.” The outcomes of the dialogues will move forward with the national food systems transformation pathway in the coming months and years.
About United Nations 2021 Food Systems Summit

Title: FAO enhances Uzbekistan's capacity in achieving Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 29 June 2021
Uzbekistan like other countries has confirmed its commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and has accepted the requirements for achieving the SDGs at the national level. National Goals and Objectives on sustainable development for the period up to 2030 and a road map of actions for their achievement were approved via a resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers dated October 20, 2018. Implementation of the SDGs in Uzbekistan is fully consistent with large-scale reforms within the framework of the "National Action Strategy for Five Priority Development Areas in 2017-2021". The SDGs are introduced in national and regional development strategies and programs, including the Concept of Social and Economic Development of Uzbekistan until 2030.
The FAO project on strengthening national capacities in SDG implementation and monitoring was aimed at strengthening the capacities of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics and other relevant stakeholders to implement SDGs efficiently, covering accessible, quality and timely data collection at the country level.
«Implementation of this project contributed to the accelerated SDG achievement building on the key role of the food and agricultural sector in the 2030 Agenda. FAO contributed to capacity development at national partner institutions being Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, the State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics and other relevant institutions in integrating SDGs into sectoral development policy frameworks, programmes and budget and in SDG reporting. National capacities in SDG indicators monitoring and reporting were strengthened as well», - said Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan.
Participants of the round table discussed issues related to the government’s role in ensuring food security and achieving the SDGs, gender aspects as well as issues of involving farmers and dehkans in the implementation of the Agriculture Development Strategy and Food Security Program in Uzbekistan along with the contribution of private companies.

Title: On World Refugee Day, UNHCR acknowledges inclusion of refugees in health, education and sport in Uzbekistan
Content: 20 June 2021
As of the end of 2020 Central Asia hosts 7,386 refugees and asylum seekers, including 13 refugees in Uzbekistan. Most of them have access to medical care, including COVID-19 vaccination, and education. UNHCR will continue supporting authorities and other partners to ensure full inclusion of all refugees in healthcare, education, employment and social protection to enable them to fully contribute to the development of their host communities.
“In 2021, we mark World Refugee Day amid a continuing pandemic, which has put a strain on health care, schools and our communities. But the pandemic has also taught us that we are stronger when we stand together. Given the chance to study and work, refugees will continue to contribute to a stronger, safer and more vibrant world,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia.
Despite the pandemic, the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people, according to UNHCR’s latest annual Global Trends report released on 18 June. This is a further four per cent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019.
World Refugee Day is an opportunity to acknowledge the experiences of the millions of people forced to flee violence and persecution. But it is also a day to celebrate the fact that, with help from welcoming communities and kind neighbours, people can find the strength to heal, rebuild and even thrive.
This year, World Refugee Day is focused on the power of inclusion in health systems, education and sports. Health care because of importance of working together to recover from the pandemic. Education because of the millions of children whose education was interrupted by the pandemic. And sports because it transcends language and nationality to bring people together. In 2021, a team of 29 refugee athletes will join the Tokyo Games with the support of UNHCR and the International Olympic and Paralympic Committees.

Title: The second subnational dialogue as part of Uzbekistan's preparation for the UN Food Systems Summit
Content: 17 June 2021
The safety of food systems has an immense impact on human health, the environment, and economic and cultural development. Wide range of stakeholders have been invited to participate in the Food Systems Summit dialogues, from youth activists and farm workers to academics and business leaders. Their task is to identify the most effective ways to create sustainable solutions to improve the food supply system in the country.
Within the framework of the dialogue, the participants exchanged views on joint actions to transform the food systems in the country, taking into account the specific characteristics of the region also emphasizing the need for more integrated cooperation between stakeholders.
The first subnational dialogue was held on June 9 in the city of Nukus of Karakalpakstan, where  food systems matters were discussed on a  regional level as well. Participants identified main obstacles hindering a proper access of the population to food products made by local producers of Karakalpakstan.
The Government of Uzbekistan has adopted and is in the process of implementing a major sector development strategy for 2020-2030 along with other legal documents aiding the transformation of food systems in the country. They contribute to the efficient use of land and water resources, the introduction of resource-saving technologies, attracting investments, the development of modern formats of agricultural activities, in particular, clusters and cooperative structures. The expected outcome of the UN Food Systems Summit Dialogues is the development of a national programme for ensuring sustainable national food systems for the next decade in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The dialogues also provide an opportunity to implement the development plan employing internationally accredited methods, principles, rules, actions along with existing partnerships and commitments.
"Food systems affect all aspects of human being. Achieving food and nutrition security for all is at the heart of FAO’s efforts – to make sure people have constant and sufficient access to good-quality food to lead active and healthy lives. Our mandate is to increase agricultural productivity, improve nutrition, raise the standard of living in rural populations and contribute to global economic growth", - spoke Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan.
«Uzbekistan was among the first countries that confirmed its interest and support to the organization of the Summit as well as of the National Dialogues. Encouraging everyone to comprehend the fact that we must all work together to change the way the world produces, consumes and perceive food will be one of the most significant accomplishments of the Summit. This Summit is for everyone and is aimed at finding solutions that will require everyone to act to transform food systems» - noted Bakhadur Paluaniyazov, Environment and Climate Action Cluster Leader, UNDP in Uzbekistan.
The upcoming global summit in fall will strive to kickstart enhanced action on the Sustainable Development Goals, each of which contributes to healthier, more sustainable, inclusive and equitable food systems which in turn has set five significant objectives such as:

Title: United Nations Development Programme affirms its commitment to further support Uzbekistan
Content: 16 June 2021
During her two-day visit to Uzbekistan over 15-16 June 2021, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, Director of the UNDP Regional Bureau for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to support the country’s people-centred, green and resilient development, particularly in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic. Ms. Spoljaric Egger has said UNDP will continue working with the government and people of Uzbekistan to develop and deliver sustainable solutions to human development challenges, without incurring environmental costs.
"I commend Uzbekistan’s swift and comprehensive COVID19 response, the urge to look beyond recovery, and how response efforts have been linked to medium and longer-term sustainable development needs,” she said. “Right now, there is great momentum as Uzbekistan forms its next development strategy for 2022-2026 and determines future directions of growth.”
During her visit Ms. Spoljaric Egger renewed UNDP’s collaboration with national partners in strengthening good governance, creating green economic growth which benefits all citizens and promoting clean energy and better means of environmental protection. She also reiterated UNDP’s continued dedication to helping find innovative solutions to perennial challenges, including those faced in the Aral Sea region.
“UNDP advocates for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) integration and will support a combination of policy and investments in governance, social protection, green economy, and digitalization – the four areas where we call for an ‘SDG Push’.” - Ms. Spoljaric Egger highlighted.
On 15 June Ms Spoljaric Egger attended an International Business Forum on enhancing women’s economic empowerment in Uzbekistan and throughout Central Asia. There she reiterated UNDP’s goal to mainstream gender within Uzbekistan’s critical entrepreneurship sector and address legal and regulatory barriers that prevent women’s participation in the economy.
In addition, on 16 June Ms. Spoljaric Egger handed over special equipment to Tashkent’s ‘Ishga Marhamat’ jobs center, whose job training programmes will increase youth employment as Uzbekistan enters the ‘Year of Supporting Youth and Improving Public Health’.
While in Uzbekistan Ms. Spoljaric Egger reasserted UNDP’s commitment to some of the most important national directions of continued growth. These include improving parliamentary oversight of SDGs, driving forward Uzbekistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy with a focus on vulnerable population groups, advancing Uzbekistan’s green recovery and transition from COVID-19, and supporting the National Gender Strategy.
As Regional Director of UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Europe and the CIS since October 2018, Ms. Spoljaric Egger has led projects and teams in 17 countries and one territory. This has become Ms. Spoljaric Egger’s first foreign trip since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.

Title: Entrepreneurial trainings for people with disabilities
Content: 08 June 2021
Within the UN Joint Programme on Social Protection in Uzbekistan, the UNDP has held a micro-grant competition for small social initiatives which seek to protect the rights of people with disabilities in Uzbekistan. The Public Association of Disabled People named “Inclusive Society” in the city of Tashkent is one of the 11 winners. The chairperson of Association, Ms. Nodira Tillaeva, shares her experience, project ideas and implementation path.
“In fact, many organizations do not hire people in the 1st and 2nd categories of disability” says Nodira Tillayeva. The reason is behind this is the belief that people with disabilities in these categories may easily become tired and might not be able to fully (or dully) deliver their duties. Yet, potential employers incorrectly understand their responsibilities. Every organization is obliged to create jobs for people with disabilities, and to provide requisite working conditions. In practice, an employer should give a chance to a person with a disability, and actually check their skills during a probation period before saying “we cannot hire you.”
Thus, the Association got awarded a small grant for a project which aims to provide equal rights and opportunities to people with disabilities, on par with other people in society, through training young people with disabilities in computer literacy and accounting. The project team has developed a special training course in this direction. The future objectives are to improve the computer literacy of young people with disabilities, to teach them how to use the Internet, and to teach them the basics of accounting, thereby increasing their chances of getting a job. We will make every effort to develop this social programme. We hope that we will be able to create a better future for young women and men with disabilities, as well as provide them with opportunities to find happiness, including building their own families.
Nodira says “When people have no jobs, they can easily get depressed and lose their self-confidence.” That is why, shebelieves the implementation of this project is vital. Nodira understands perfectly well the feelings and situations of persons with disabilities. Chairperson, herself is an accountant. And she sees the promise and advantages that this career holds for persons with disabilities. One benefit is that you can work from home, online, without a need to go outside. Computer abilities and accounting skills are interrelated. It can be difficult to do accounting work without having good computer skills.
After running these two courses on accounting, Nodira wishes to teach the participants the entrepreneurial skills, which would allow them to open their own businesses. Entrepreneurs can do business only if they know how to manage their income and expenses well. If one wants to be a successful entrepreneur, it is important to have a better understanding of cost and benefit analysis. So, knowing the basics of accounting will definitely help. And what is more, these entrepreneurs could themselves create new jobs for other people with disabilities.

Title: Gender Audit of Labour Laws was discussed in Uzbekistan
Content: 28 May 2021
The webinar covered theoretical and practical approaches to gender audit of the legislation. Participants were representatives of the Uzbek parliament, ministries, and social partners of the ILO like the Federation of Trade Unions. Mr Bakhodir Umurzakov, Deputy Minister for Employment and Labour Relations of the Republic of Uzbekistan, highlighted reforms being undertaken in Uzbekistan to ensure gender equality, particularly the recent law on population’s employment dated October 20, 2020. He emphasised a new approach that had been taken in this law to tackle the issues of gender inequality at work. However, despite progress in this field, problems are still enduring. Mr Umurzakov pointed out the need to enable access to women and girls to education, decent working conditions, quality child care, equal pay for work of equal value, fairness in unpaid care, domestic and agricultural work. He believes that the new labour code that has been drafted will reflect these problems, and this webinar series will help improve its quality.
In the main part of the webinar Valerie Van Goethem, Labour Law Specialist (ILO – LABOURLAW), presented the theoretical background of gender audit, its objectives and methodology. Also, a particular focus in her presentation was given to UN Equality in Law for Women and Girls Strategy 2019-2023. Valentina Beghini, Technical Specialist on Gender Equality and Non-discrimination (ILO – GEDI), provided an overview of the ILO framework and approach to gender equality in the context of labour laws. The participants expressed particular interest in possible gender audit parameters that can serve as a guideline for policy-makers. After the presentations, the participants discussed important aspects of gender audit in the context of low-income and developing countries.
A practical part of the webinar followed a brief poll designed to strengthen the acquired knowledge. The participants conducted an audit of selected sections of the draft Labour Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan from a gender perspective.
Closing the webinar Ms Jasmina Papa, Social Protection Specialist (ILO), assured the ILO’s continued commitment to support Uzbekistan in promoting gender equality and welcomed the proposal expressed by the participants to collaborate on conducting a gender audit of the national legislation. She also wished the webinar participants to take an active engagement in the policy-making process and use gender equality lenses in developing and reviewing legal acts and policies.

Title: FAO celebrates World Bee Day
Content: 19 May 2021
The Programme on Support to Sustainable Apiculture Development is being implemented in Uzbekistan
20 may 2021, Tashkent – In 2018 the UN General Assembly declared 20 May as World Bee Day. Every year this day enables us to raise awareness on the essential role bees and other pollinators play in keeping people and the planet healthy, and on the many challenges they face today. This year, World Bee Day falls during an exceptional moment in history, when many countries continue to deal with the widespread effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The day calls for global cooperation and solidarity to counter the threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to food security and agricultural livelihoods alongside prioritizing environmental regeneration and pollinator protection.
FAO Representation in Uzbekistan in cooperation with Association of Uzbekistan Beekeepers implements Technical Cooperation Programme on Support to Sustainable Apiculture Development. The Programme aims to improve living conditions of rural population while contributing to implementation of the Decree of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan "On measures for the further development of the beekeeping industry in the Republic".
«By implementing this Programme we bring high-level attention to introduction of innovative technologies in the beekeeping industry, equipment supply, improvement of teaching capacities of  educational institutions for preparing apiculture specialists as well as to promotion of international exchange of experience through translating and adapting textbooks and enhancing cooperation with foreign apiculture experts», - Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan noted, adding that «As part of the Programme, the Innovative Information Exchange System was developed for beekeepers».
It is a mobile app, through which beekeepers can get all the necessary educational and statistical information including data on the location of colonies and early pesticide warning in order to prevent honey bee loses. The implementation of the Programme also includes a gender-sensitive analysis of the value chains of key apicultural commodities.
World Bee Day provides an opportunity for governments, organizations, civil society and for all concerned citizens to promote actions that will protect and enhance pollinators and their habitats, improve their abundance and diversity, and support the sustainable development of beekeeping. Now is a time to re-think how we relate to nature and pollinators and what actions we can take to support these tiny hard workers and the millions of livelihoods they, in turn, support.

Title: KOICA and UNOPS hand over life-saving medical equipment and supplies  to Uzbekistan to assist the Ministry of Health combat the COVID-19 pandemic
Content: 12 May 2021
These deliveries are being made as a part of KOICA’s 5 million USD 2020 Emergency Response Program, under which a 3.2 million USD project is managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). The project aims to help the Government of Uzbekistan combat the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. It will be focusing on providing COVID-19 screening, advanced laboratory and diagnostic equipment, and other life-saving laboratory and medical supplies to Tashkent, Nukus, and Samarkand.
These items will be deployed to seven institutions in Uzbekistan, namely the Ministry of Health; Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare and Public Health Service; Research Institute of Virology; National Children’s Medical Center; Clinic under the Medical Institute of Karakalpakstan; L. Isaev Branch of the Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Center of Epidemiology, Microbiology, Infectious and Parasitic Diseases in Samarkand; and Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Center for Phthisiology and Pulmonology. An additional 600 thousand USD was allocated for procurement of a CT Scanner for the Research Institute of Virology separately by KOICA.
An official event to commence the handover of equipment to Uzbekistan was held on May 12 at the KOICA Simulating-Innovation Learning Center of the National Children’s Medical Center (NCMC) in Tashkent with the participation of Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare and Public Health Service, KOICA, NCMC and UNOPS.
Over the next months, the remaining essential medical equipment and supplies will be arriving in Uzbekistan. UNOPS and its partners will also conduct capacity development sessions to the relevant medical personnel on operating and maintaining the equipment.
These interventions will aim to strengthen the country’s capability to identify and surveil COVID-19 and other infectious disease cases among its population and people entering Uzbekistan in a timely manner. The project will also aspire to advance the long-term laboratory and medical diagnostic and epidemiological response capacities of the mentioned laboratories and medical facilities.

Title: Applying GIS tools is imperative of today. FAO is hosting Workshop on GIS-technologies in TSAU
Content: 06 May 2021
Geographic Information System (GIS) is a framework for gathering, processing, and analyzing data. Rooted in the science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data as well as analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes. Through data visualization, one can get maps, graphs, tables and even images of the area of interest.
«This data is of great importance for scientific research, as well as for the work of individual organizations and companies. Therefore, through participation in this workshop undergraduates, graduate students and professors of the university will develop their capacity to improve their work. The new GIS laboratory is equipped with the state-of-art computers, data center, server, plotter, and GPS equipment. All this creates new opportunities for the introduction of innovative technologies in agriculture», - Sherzod Umarov, Assistant FAO Representative in Uzbekistan stressed.
During the workshop, national and foreign experts are sharing general concepts about the tools of various geographic information systems. In practice, the workshop participants are learning how to work with such innovative platforms and apps as Trends Earth for monitoring land degradation, Collect Earth for assessing deforestation and various forms of land use, Earth Map to visualize, process and analyze satellite imagery and global datasets on climate, vegetation, fires, biodiversity, geo-social and other topics.
Thus, GIS technology is not just a collection of systematized information - it is a special view of the world around us. Nowadays, they are used everywhere - in woodworking, construction, cartography, ecology, seismology, etc.
«GIS technologies present a whole industry that today has an impact on almost all spheres of life plating an important role in agriculture. For example, using GIS technologies makes it possible to analyze how soil type, climate and yield of certain crops relate to each other, thereby developing more efficient methods of operating, saving significant financial resources», - Muhammadjon Kosimov, National Project Manager noted.

Title: FAO Beekeeping Contest winners awarded
Content: 15 April 2021
The awarding ceremony for the winners of the best beekeeping industry coverage contest was organized by the FAO Representation in Uzbekistan together with the Association of Beekeepers of Uzbekistan.
The creative competition included the following categories: "The Best Children's Drawing" and "The Best Photo". The participants reflected their visions of ancient beekeeping traditions, useful properties of honey, and the beauty of the surrounding nature through illustrative media – photos and pictures. When evaluating artwork, both talent and skill, as well as the semantic content were taken into account. Gulzor Sultanova, one of the well-known Uzbek artists and sculptors, has contributed as a jury in the competition. As the winners of the "Best Children’s Drawing" category were declared the following people: Roza Asylgareeva, Abdumannop Abduvaliyev, Fayzulloh Rustamov and Zakiya Kosimzhonova. At the same time Ibrohimbek Habibullayev, Umida Alikulova and Khislatbek Abduvositov were recognized as the authors of the best photos. All the winners were awarded with valuable prizes from the FAO Representation in Uzbekistan.
The aim of the contest was to draw people’s attention to the development of beekeeping as an important branch of agriculture of Uzbekistan. The bee is one of the most industrious creatures in nature, and has long benefited humans, plants and the environment. By carrying pollen from one flower to another, bees and other pollinators enable not only the production of an abundance of fruits, nuts and seeds, but also more variety and better quality, contributing to food security and nutrition.
The introduction of modern technologies and best practices in beekeeping as well as improving marketing strategies are important for the development of the industry. The recent competition was organized within the framework of the FAO Technical Cooperation Programme "Support to Sustainable Apiculture Development", which opens up new opportunities for training and increasing the potential of beekeeping specialists. Within the framework of the program, series of trainings, exchange visits of technical personnel to other countries, and transfer of relevant technologies to the Uzbek beekeepers is provided.
On the same day, an online meeting was held with the participation of representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Association of Beekeepers of Uzbekistan and FAO experts, where the Information Exchange System for Beekeepers was presented, which is currently being developed as part of the FAO Technical Cooperation Program " Support to Sustainable Apiculture Development". The new system will provide beekeepers with all the necessary educational and statistical information. It also includes data on the location of colonies owned by each beekeeper, which will be reflected on a special map so that beekeepers avoid placing the bee farms close to each other. In addition, the new system will provide early pesticide warning in order to prevent honey bee loses, so the beekeepers can take immediate action.

Title: Science, technology and innovation are key to transform agri-food systems in Central Asia
Content: 15 March 2021
With focus on science, technology and innovation, Central Asian countries can contribute to agri-food systems transformation and serve as a model for other regions facing similar challenges amid the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said today at the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Agriculture of Central Asia. The virtual event, hosted by the Government of Kyrgyz Republic, focused on innovations in agri-food systems.
"The pandemic is giving us a rare opportunity to reset, rethink and redouble our efforts to build forward better and greener, using coordinated approaches that are inclusive, holistic, and coherent," the Director-General said alluding to the region's major potential for establishing innovative models for cooperation fostering game-changing solutions to common challenges.
He stressed the importance of making agri-food systems capable of providing access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for all, while ensuring environmental sustainability. To this end, he encouraged Ministers to revisit their development strategies with a focus on innovation, policy, investment and infrastructure, including roads, food storage and research facilities. The FAO chief also underscored the need to carry out holistic feasibility studies in order to attract more investment.
The Director-General reiterated FAO's support to the region with innovative and transformative approaches, including FAO's evidence-based, country-led and country-owned Hand-in-Hand Initiative.
He also encouraged the Central Asian countries to strengthen ties with the Joint FAO/WHO Centre which integrates workstreams on food safety, animal diseases and antimicrobial resistance, the Joint FAO/IAEA Centre on Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, as well as the FAO Investment Centre.
Furthermore, the FAO Director-General pointed out that FAO stands ready to support the countries in the UN Food Systems Summit 2021 preparatory process and in the implementation of the Summit's follow-up actions and recommendations, highlighting the vital role of national, regional and international partnerships in agri-food systems transformation.
For his part, the Minister of Agriculture, Water Resources and Regional Development of the Kyrgyz Republic, Askarbek Janybekov, noted that the pandemic unveiled the vulnerability of food systems and the immediate need for introducing new technologies in the sector. Given how interconnected food systems in the region are, these issues cannot be addressed in isolation, the Minister stressed. Today's meeting proves that the countries in Central Asia share the common vision, and are ready to tackle the challenges together in line with the global and regional agendas, the Minister added.
The Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Tajikistan, Suleymon Ziyozoda, noted that the agricultural sector is one of the key priorities of the national policy underscoring the importance of strengthening innovative agricultural development, diversifying agricultural production, and improving food production infrastructure. He also pointed to the need for establishing regional centres for exchanging and distributing technical solutions with FAO playing a key role in coordinating these developments and platforms.
The Minister of Agriculture and Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan, Allanur Altyyev, noted that strengthening cooperation with international organizations plays an important role in the development of the multi-vector foreign policy course in the country and expressed satisfaction with the intensified exchange and cooperation between his country and FAO. He also highlighted the need to develop a close cooperation among the agriculture ministers of Central Asia as well as the importance of having such exchange of views on issues related to international and regional cooperation on a regular basis.
The Minister of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Jamshid Khodjaev, said that the food and agriculture sector should serve as a major platform to demonstrate innovations - from the creation of new fertilisers, animal and plant species to the production of safe and nutritious food. He pointed out that companies that would be able to offer solutions at affordable prices would become leaders in the digitalization of agriculture, adding that state authorities should support any such development.
The First Vice-Minister of Agriculture of Kazakhstan, Aidarbek Saparov, stated that the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the weaknesses, gaps and inequalities in food systems and demonstrated the urgent need to ensure their sustainability, inclusiveness, and flexibility. He noted that this, however, required agri-food systems transformation which could not happen without innovation in policy, technology, and business models.
Representatives from the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) intervened as well.

Title: UN launches ‘Only Together’ campaign to support global vaccine equity call
Content: 11 March 2021
The initiative underscores the need for global solidarity to ensure vaccines are accessible in all countries, initially targeting healthcare workers and the most vulnerable.
“The virus has killed more than 2.5 million people, and left millions more with debilitating long-term health effects”, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video message to launch the campaign.
"Over the past year, we’ve all missed out on doing the things we love to do with others—eating, hugging, and going to school and work”, said UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed, adding that “millions of us have lost someone we love or had our livelihoods taken away.”
With the biggest vaccine roll out in history now underway, millions of doses are being delivered across the globe, including to some of the world’s poorest countries, through the efforts of COVAX, the UN-led global vaccine equity mechanism.
The COVID-19 vaccines will stop people from dying, prevent new variants from emerging, reignite economies and offer the best hope to end the pandemic.
Also highlighting that “an unprecedented global scientific effort for vaccines has given us hope to defeat the virus,” Ms. Mohammed stressed that new momentum and hope will emerge “only if we work together to ensure everyone, everywhere has access to COVID-19 vaccines. Only together can we end the pandemic and transform a new era of hope.”
Expressing concern over “a small number of rich countries are rolling out a majority of the doses,” Mr. Guterres emphasized that “COVID-19 vaccines must be considered a global public good.”
By the end of 2021, COVAX aims to offer vaccines to about a third of each participating country’s population. But that progress pales in comparison to the 10 richest countries who possess nearly 80 per cent of all COVID-19 vaccines, with some planning to vaccinate their entire population within the next few months.
“No country can overcome this crisis in isolation,” said the UN chief, urging that “Governments and businesses must share doses and technology, so supply goes further, and distribution goes faster.”
COVAX, co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO), GAVI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and in partnership with UNICEF, has support from 190 participating countries. It still needs more than $2 billion to fully meet its goal to vaccinate those most in need by the end of the year.

Fourteen vehicles, strategic tactical equipment, office multimedia and other equipment worth $674,000 required for the operationalization of the newly established Interagency Mobile Teams and Border Liaison Offices have been transferred to NCDC, State Customs Committee, State Security Service, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Border Troops of the State Security Service and the Department for Combating Economic Crimes under the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Uzbekistan. In addition, equipment worth over half a million US dollars has been delivered to the State Customs Committee in support of the establishment of a Situation Centre in their Central Office in Tashkent being inaugurated soon.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Olim Narzullaev, Director of the National Information and Analytical Centre on Drug Control of the Republic of Uzbekistan, noted, “I am sure that with timely  support the practical implementation of these initiatives will contribute to the creation of the necessary obstacles on the way of the incessant flow of drugs along the Northern Route, which will undoubtedly affect the security of the Central Asian states, as well as the countries of the West and far abroad”.
This hand-over is part of the implementation of the grant agreement signed between UNODC and the Government of Japan in February 2020 with an aim to counter illicit drug trafficking and transnational organized crime through enhancing regional cross-border cooperation by strengthening the capacity of Border Liaison Offices in Central Asia and Interagency Mobile Teams in Uzbekistan within the framework of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia (2015-2021). The initiative contributes to advancing Uzbekistan’s Action Strategy for 2017-2021 and the achievement of Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Implementation of the initiative at the national level is coordinated by the NCDC.
During the ceremony, the hand-over documents were signed by high-level officials from the above-mentioned agencies and the UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia in presence of H.E. Mr. Yoshinori Fujiyama, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Republic of Uzbekistan. Speaking on this occasion, H.E. Mr. Yoshinori Fujiyama, the Ambassador of Japan underlined, “Taking this opportunity, I’d like to ask for cooperation of all the colleagues from Uzbek Government and UNODC for smooth implementation of the project, by effectively utilizing the provided equipment. And also, let me conclude by saying that I do hope that this project will be the symbolic milestone to deepen and widen our mutual cooperation between Japan and UNODC in Central Asian Countries”.
Ms. Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia reiterated UNODC’s commitment to further support the Government of Uzbekistan in promoting a balanced approach to addressing the drug problem in the country by strengthening law enforcement response to trafficking of narcotics, new psychotropic substances and strengthening control over medical substances on one hand, and drug demand reduction on the other. “Strengthened inter-agency cooperation between the law enforcement through information sharing and promoting joint operations has demonstrated the positive results and lead to an increased interdiction. With the Department for Combating Economic Crimes under the General Prosecutor’s Office joining the initiative, it will not only prevent drug trafficking, but also help to better trace illicit financial flows. We are pleased that the 13 operational IMTs will cover all regions across the country and serve as a sustainable platform to cooperate and coordinate activities from operative level to strategic planning and analysis. Addressing transnational organized crimes such as drug trafficking requires a greater cross-border cooperation in the region, and this is possible through Border Liaison Offices. This has proven to yield strategic results as we have already established 4 BLOs in Uzbekistan”, she added.

Title: Uzbekistan is on Track to Enhanced Transparency Framework  Transition
Content: 23 January 2021
In Uzbekistan, a FAO project on the improvement of the national capacity for transparency-related activities in line with national priorities is seeking for GEF funds.
It should assist the government, private sector, academia, in strengthening their current reporting instruments, including more up-to-date inventories of emission sources and sinks using advanced IPCC guidance, and institutional arrangements with the relevant tools, trainings and assistance for progress towards its Enhanced Transparent Framework (ETF).
The project discussion was launched with a stakeholder online meeting on 22 January. Participants were involved in the project design as well as discussed ways to identify synergies and areas of collaboration with different partners. FAO specialists and officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Forestry Committee, the State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection and the Center for the Hydrometeorological Service of Uzbekistan participated in the workshop.
The Paris Agreement  is aimed to combat climate change and its impacts, by signing of which Uzbekistan committed  to limit the rise of the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius. To reach this goal, each country has developed individual climate commitments, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). Additionally, there are other provisions under the Paris Agreement that are focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation regulation in a country. It is globally agreed to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts by creating a framework for the transparent monitoring, reporting, and ratcheting up of countries’ climate goals. In order  to increase the ambition of the counties’ pledges by revealing information on Parties’ climate efforts, a new “Enhanced Transparency Framework” (ETF) is supposed  to report and review information on Parties’ greenhouse gas emissions, progress made in implementing and achieving NDCs, their adaptation actions, and the financial, technological and capacity-building support needed, received and provided to developing country Parties.
The government officially signed the Paris Agreement on 19 April 2017, and ratified it in November 2018. The NDC sets mitigation and adaptation objectives “to decrease specific emissions of greenhouse gases per unit of GDP by 10% by 2030 from level of 2010” and “to continue its efforts for adaptation capacity building to reduce risk of climate change adverse impact on various sectors of economy, social sector and Priaralie (Aral Sea coastal zone).”
The project contributes to the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) under the GEF-7 Climate Change Mitigation Focal Area Strategy to support projects that build institutional and technical capacity to meet the enhanced transparency requirements in the Paris Agreement. The CBIT aims to:

Title: Uzbekistan is making healthy diets a cornerstone of national policy with the help of WHO
Content: 12 January 2021
NCDs such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, which are closely associated with risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity, remain an urgent public health challenge in Uzbekistan. NCDs are responsible for approximately 79% of all deaths in the country, and cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of premature mortality.
“About a third of the adult population in the country has hypertension, and a fifth is at high risk of having a heart attack or stroke,” stated Dr Lianne Kuppens, WHO Representative to Uzbekistan. “Furthermore, over a quarter of men smoke tobacco and approximately half the adult population is overweight or obese.”
To reverse this worrying trend, in early 2020, Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Health with support from the Presidential Administration began to work on regulations that would make food healthier for all people in the country. In November, the new approach was adopted in the form of a presidential resolution, making healthier diets an important part of national policy.
In preparing this new approach, the Government of Uzbekistan collaborated with multiple stakeholders. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and WHO country offices in Uzbekistan were invited as members of the working group and steering committee. The WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and WHO/Europe’s food safety programme provided technical expertise for the revision of the draft legislative package.
The newly adopted presidential resolution launched a nationwide nutrition policy based on the best evidence-based practices, including:
Uzbekistan’s firm resolve to tackle NCDs and leave no one behind in ensuring better health and well-being reflects the country’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals and the WHO European Programme of Work for 2020–2025, “United Action for Better Health in Europe”.
The confirmation of the new policy was on the agenda of the international online conference “Improvement of the support system of the population with safe food products”, held on 30 November 2020. The event gathered international experts from UNICEF, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and WHO to discuss the current and proposed reforms to the food safety system in Uzbekistan, as well as more general policies to promote healthy nutrition and food safety.
“The introduction and implementation of these policies are very important achievements for healthy nutrition and lifestyles in Uzbekistan,” said Dr João Breda, Special Adviser to the WHO Regional Director for Europe. “The country has our full support for upcoming steps, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration.”
The conference was organized jointly by the Senate of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. A new draft law on food safety in Uzbekistan was presented at the conference, and will be further discussed with FAO, UNICEF and WHO to align it with international standards.

Title: EU-UNESCO encapsulated preliminary results of the project to support the agricultural sector in Uzbekistan
Content: 11 January 2021
The workshop is hosted by the European Union, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education of the Republic of Uzbekistan (MHSSE) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
In July 2020, The European Union (EU) provided a 9.6 million EUR contribution to the “Skills development for employability in rural areas of Uzbekistan” project, which will be implemented by UNESCO within the period of 2020-2024. The project will contribute to improving the quality, relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of the skills development system in the agriculture and irrigation sectors in four selected regions of Uzbekistan (Karakalpakstan, Khorazm, Bukhara and Surkhondaryo). The project is aligned with the Uzbekistan Agriculture Modernization Project that was launched in the 20-th of December 2019 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Uzbekistan Agroindustry and Food Security Agency (UZAIFSA).
Through this project, UNESCO continues providing assistance in developing, testing and piloting new initiatives and approaches, including the training of teachers and trainers in the agriculture and irrigation sectors. The provided assistance is expected to contribute to scaling up transversal methods, high-technology agriculture and food processing, and innovative approaches throughout the country.
The purpose of the workshop is to share and discuss the preliminary findings on needs assessment and analysis of the status of skills development in agriculture and irrigation in the four selected regions in Uzbekistan; the latest developments in agricultural education and training implied by Presidential decrees; and the draft structure of the Project Inception Report.
Due to the limitations and restrictions imposed by COVID-19, the workshop is being held through the use of an online platform and features representatives both from UNESCO Headquarters and the UNESCO Tashkent Office, the European Union, ministries concerned and other relevant stakeholders, embassies, international organizations and development partners, relevant universities, as well as representatives of the media.
Speaking at the opening of the workshop, both the EU representative  François Begeot, Head of Cooperation Unit, and the UNESCO representative in Uzbekistan Jan Hladík, underscored the importance of the project for the well-being of the population of Uzbekistan and the modernization of agriculture.
On the first day of the event, UNESCO experts presented the preliminary findings on needs assessment and the analysis of the status of skills development in agriculture and irrigation and set the foundations of a meaningful and fruitful national dialogue. The participants engaged in a lively Q&A exchange with the experts which was supported by several interesting facts and figures from the recently completed field missions. In particular, global climate change, population growth and the development of sectors of the economy of Uzbekistan cause an annual increase in their need for water, as a result of which the shortage of water resources increases from year to year. Over the past 15 years, per capita water availability has declined from 3,048 cubic meters to 1,589 cubic meters. To address these and other challenges, the republic is taking significant steps, for the effective implementation of which it is necessary to develop the necessary skills in water management. This, in turn, requires further improvement of the skills development system in agriculture and water management.
On the second day, the participants will receive a synopsis of the National Qualifications Framework in Uzbekistan as well as the national political and legal developments and how they align with the project activities and objectives. Finally, the workshop will close with a discussion and agreement on the structure of the Project Inception Report, one of the fundamental documents for planning and implementing activities.
About the Project
“Skills Development in Rural Areas of Uzbekistan” is aimed to enhance the living standards in rural areas through better employability. The specific objective is to equip women and men in Uzbekistan with relevant skills for a sustainable, diversified and modernised agriculture.

Title: New Uzbekistan Lounge heralds a more modern and environmentally sustainable public space in FAO’s headquarters
Content: 07 January 2021
The FAO-Uzbekistan Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) represents the first contribution from an FAO Member to the planned transformation of the public space at FAO’s headquarters – all with the aim to create an innovative space for showcasing agriculture and technology and facilitating knowledge exchange.
Today’s agreement reflects the shared wish of FAO and the Government of Uzbekistan to further strengthen what is already an excellent collaboration.

The Minister, who remains Chairperson of the ERC in the intersessional period, updated the Director-General on activities following the Conference and outlined some of Uzbekistan’s priorities for 2021.
The Director-General stated that the Lounge is another example of Uzbekistan’s contribution to FAO’s transformation and alluded to the central role that hospitality plays in the Uzbek culture.
Uzbekistan’s Minister for Agriculture Jamshid Khodjaev confirmed: “We want every person who enters the room to feel Uzbekistan’s culture, tradition and hospitality”.
The Uzbekistan Lounge – with capacity to accommodate 80 people - will also reflect the country’s colours and texture and will inspire a sense of light, space and harmony. The Lounge, which will be located on the top floor of the Organization’s building, will follow FAO’s objectives to embrace modernity, adhere to safety regulations and promote environmental sustainability.

Title: National online workshop on national disaster loss database implementation in Uzbekistan
Content: 18 December 2020
The support for the establishment of a mechanism for accounting the damage and losses resulting from disasters is part of the UNDRR Initiative “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia 2019-2022” funded by the European Union.
The goal of the national workshop was to demonstrate the functions of the “DesInventar-Sendai” software and its use for the systematic collection, documentation and analysis of data related to disaster losses and to facilitate national reporting on the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Representatives of UNDRR, experts from the CIMA Research Foundation and ADPC presented the implementation steps, recommendations and technical details to the experts from Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Housing and Communal Services, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry for Development of Information Technologies and Communications, State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, State Committee for Land Resources, Geodesy, Cartography and State Cadastre, State Committee on Statistics, Academy of Sciences, and Centre for Hydrometeorological Service.
The participants reviewed and discussed the existing national system for collecting and analyzing data on disaster losses, its strengths and areas for improvement. Each ministry analyzed its role as contributing agency and highlighted the opportunities and challenges in data collection process.
Experts from the CIMA Research Foundation demonstrated the customization process of the “DesInventar Sendai” software configuration. The workshop program included discussion on adaptation of the “DesInventar-Sendai” data card to the national data collection form for losses and adding appropriate indicators and disaggregation categories.
The implementation of the “DesInventar Sendai” system software has helped more than 90 countries worldwide to develop sustainable disaster information management systems aligned with the Sendai Framework monitoring process. The system allows to analyze disaster trends and impacts through a large range of sectoral and socio-economical dimensions. As a main benefit, the “DesInventar Sendai” system supports a dialogue on risk management and disaster risk reduction planning between all stakeholders from the local to the regional level.

Title: Central Asian countries strengthen coordination in disaster risk reduction
Content: 11 December 2020
In the annual meeting, the delegations of the countries analyzed the implementation of the Action Plan (Roadmap) for the implementation of the Framework for strengthening regional cooperation of Central Asian countries in the field of DRR and emergency situations in 2019-2021 adopted by the 2019 Regional Forum - Meeting of Heads of NDMAs. The national delegations reiterated the importance of preparedness for the new emerging threats such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reiterated the value of exchange of information and experience in building capacity for reducing the possible losses.
The programme of the Forum included presentation of the first draft of the Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction, developed by CESDRR within the EU-funded Initiative. The strategy, aiming at reducing risk of cross-border scale and nature, calls for better exchange of information, joint risk assessment, building capacity of emergency management organizations, raising awareness of the existing and possible new hazards.
“We realize the importance of resilience at all levels, the importance of a strategy for regional cooperation, because not a single country can protect its population all by itself from the pandemic or from other threats”, stated Boobek Azhikeyev, Minister of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyz Republic.
“It is inspiring to see how Central Asia countries come together to share experiences, lessons learned and good practices. Just recently, in September this year, all five countries met to share experience and to coordinate actions for overcoming the COVID-19, together with international organizations. The work of the CESDRR is another concrete example of these critical efforts’, said Mr. Octavian Bivol Chief Regional Office for Europe, UNDRR.  “Next year is an important one for Member States for developing a resilient, green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening risk reduction initiatives, and improving governance. Disaster risk reduction is an investment to ensure that “never again” will we suffer such devastating consequences, whether from a biological hazard like COVID-19 or climate change.
“Strengthening resilience to potential natural disasters at all levels, from community to governments, has been an essential part of European Union’s disaster risk reduction efforts in Central Asia. Since 2003, European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO) has continuously implemented activities under its disaster preparedness program known as DIPECHO. Over the years, with a total of approximately 47 mln Euro and more than 110 projects, DIPECHO managed to promote DRR in Central Asian countries.”  - said Johannes Madsen, Head of Cooperation in Central Asia.
The Regional Forum adopted the outcome document, resolving to: acknowledge the information on the activities in disaster risk reduction in the region; further consolidate and enhance regional coordination; review the draft Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction for 2022 – 2030 and the draft Regional Risk Profile and contribute in their finalization. Central Asian states expressed willingness to work together in order to strengthen risk reduction governance and to reduce existing and future risks.
The Regional Forum brought together National Emergency Management Organizations, Sendai Focal Points, international organizations working in the area of emergency response and risk reduction, representatives of the European Union and UN system organizations.
Background information
The EU funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, including development of regional DRR strategy, regional data loss database, and enhancing the role of CESDRR as the center of excellence, the secretariat of regional platform for DRR, and a hub for regional coordination. The support on national level includes assistance in developing/adjusting national DRR strategies, disaster loss database, and establishment of national platforms for DRR. On the local level, the project will support assessment of resilience of major cities to disasters. For this project the EU committed EURO 3,750,000 for the three yeas implementation.

Title: UNICEF and Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan join efforts to improve vaccines and immunization system in Uzbekistan
Content: 10 December 2020
As part of the Joint Programme on Strengthening the Immunization System in Uzbekistan, UNICEF handed over 16 vehicles to the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan. The vehicles are for the regional departments of Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare and Public Health Service and will be used to further improve monitoring and supportive supervision activities across the country.
“Immunization is one of the key indicators, of early development of children and their protection against vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, our joint work with UNICEF in this direction is of great importance for the health and well-being of all children in our country,” said Bakhodir Yusupaliev, Deputy Minister of Health, head of Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare and Public Health Service.
Funded by Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI), UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Health to strengthen national immunization program by purchasing these vehicles. UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Health to strengthen national immunization program by construction of vaccine warehouses at national, regional and district level, procurement and installation of cold rooms, freezers and refrigerators and procurement of vehicles for transportation of vaccine and development vaccine logistic management information system.  It is expected the project will significantly improve national immunization system.
UNICEF has prioritized equitable distribution of vaccines.  Coming against a background of the COVID 19 pandemic and the race to deliver COVID19 vaccines (COVAX), equitable distribution of vaccines has become critical.
“I believe that these vehicles along with other cold chain equipment provided will significantly contribute to improving the health of children across the country,” said Geoffrey Ijumba, UNICEF Deputy Representative in Uzbekistan. ”Equitable distribution of vaccines for children has become urgent and the support handed over  today and announced in the regions is a vital step to ensure, we reach all regions with quality vaccination.“

Title: UN agencies launch a new Joint Programme to support Uzbekistan’s financing of the Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 09 December 2020
The new Joint Programme that is being launched will help the Government of Uzbekistan to strengthen the overall financing framework for its national development strategies, placing an emphasis on reducing poverty, strengthening health system, protecting the environment, promoting gender equality and ensuring effective governance.
The Integrated National Financing Framework for Sustainable Development in Uzbekistan (INFF), launched today, will run initially through 2022 and be based in the Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance. The United Nations Development Programme will lead the new programme, alongside the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
UN Resident Coordinator Helena Fraser said the timing of this joint UN programme of support to government could not have been better, as the country seeks to recover from the COVID-10 pandemic. “This Joint Programme will help the Government to recalibrate what will inevitably be reduced financing flows, to turbo-charge solutions for the Government’s ambitious SDG targets, with a specific focus on health, social protection and climate action.”
Ahadbek Haydarov, Deputy Minister of Finance, said there is a need for a comprehensive assessment of the required funding to achieve the country’s development vision in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. “We do hope this Joint Programme on Establishment of Integrated National Financing Framework for Sustainable Development in Uzbekistan will help us in this matter,” he said, adding that the Government is attracting financial resources from various sources including the State Budget and external borrowing to achieve the national development priorities and the SDGs.
UNDP Resident Representative Matilda Dimovska said the INFF is a comprehensive framework that will align Uzbekistan’s national development strategies and their financing with the Sustainable Development Goals. “It will develop public and private financing solutions and help mobilize new resources, while ensuring a more efficient use of existing finances,” she said. “UNDP, with its expertise in inclusive growth and financing development issues is ready to be supporting the Government in its way to establishing a National Financing Framework for the SDGs.”
Under Agenda 2030, world leaders have made ambitious commitments to eradicating poverty by 2030, ensuring that no one is left behind. However, securing enough resources remains a major challenge; developing countries face a gap estimated at US$2.5–3 trillion per year. Given the size, scale and level of sophistication of the global financial system, financing for national development goals is theoretically available, but such financing, mostly private, often do not reach the geographies and people that need them the most. There are, however, opportunities to reorient public and private investment towards the SDGs. State budgets, financial markets, private investors, donations and remittances are all critical to closing the financing gap.
SDGs IN UZBEKISTAN
Uzbekistan has committed to the vision of Agenda 2030 and has made it a governmental priority. With the support of the UN, national SDGs and targets are being integrated into current and new sectoral strategies and programmes. However, to achieve these ambitious targets, Uzbekistan’s spending needs are huge. A 2018 IMF assessment of spending required to achieve SDGs in health, education, and infrastructure found that the country needs additional spending of roughly 8.7% of GDP by 2030 and called for an urgent mobilization of extra resources.
The Joint Programme responds to this need to ensure a more efficient, transparent and results-oriented use of public finance resources, as well as better coordinated and integrated use of public and private financing for national development priorities. It will help the Government to draw on new sources of finance, including green bonds and crowdfunding, remittances, increased savings and investments, and assets recovered from illicit activities.
The Joint Programme is funded by the Joint SDG Fund, which was established by the UN Secretary-General to work across all 17 global goals to transform development practices by incentivizing and enabling new and innovative development approaches. The Joint SDG Fund aims to support Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams to partner with Governments in order to stimulate uptake of integrated and transformative policies leading to the creation of smart financing strategies that put SDG progress into high gear at global, regional, and country levels.
Note: The Joint SDG Fund is formed with contribution of the following donor countries: Denmark, EU, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland

Title: Second Meeting of the Ministers of Agriculture of Central Asia
Content: 08 December 2020
This meeting aimed to help FAO member states in Central Asia achieve a shared understanding of the scope of the term “digital agriculture” and of the requirements for developing and implementing a digital agriculture strategy to transform agriculture. An additional objective was to identify potential areas where innovative applications of digital technologies can be implemented over the short-term.

In his speech, Jamshid Khodjaev, the Minister of Agriculture of Uzbekistan noted that the Ministry of Agriculture is working to create an integrated information system to raise the overall level of digitalization and focuses on supporting initiatives of agricultural and food products producers to introduce smart technologies.
“Our task as the official regulator of the agricultural sector is to prepare business entities for this inevitable transition to digital format. One of the most important tasks is the creation of agrological centers and regional network for the dissemination of agricultural knowledge, which will be combined into a common complex through information technologies,” said Jamshid Khodjaev.
The Minister of Agriculture of Uzbekistan has also expressed his gratitude to the entire FAO team for developing the concept for the creation of the International Digital Council for Food and Agriculture. According to the Minister, in order to have the maximum effect, this council should focus its work on making modern digital technologies widely available to developing countries and low-income farmers.
The COVID-19 crisis has shown that governments and the private sector have the ability to rapidly scale up existing technologies and implement policies and frameworks to find solutions to the crisis. Digital solutions such as mobile money and e-payments, e-commerce and ICT-enabled information and advisory services can enhance the resilience of the agri-food system and the provision of vital support services to farmers.
“Over the next 20 years, agriculture will actively embrace information technology in a sustainable manner. Agriculture, supported by digital technologies, can become not only the driver of economic recovery, but also of change in its quality, especially for smallholders and rural households. Today's meeting is the second such event with the participation of agricultural leaders of Central Asia, and FAO is proud to be the facilitator of both of these meetings. We see these as a very important dialogue that will be shaping a dynamic future for agriculture in Central Asia,” Vladimir Rakhmanin, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative concluded.
The virtual meeting provided a platform for participating countries to share their approaches and experience, reaffirm their commitment to digital agriculture despite the difficult circumstances and create the basis for long-term joint projects.

Title: Social protection system resilient to the challenges of the world
Content: 05 December 2020
The United Nations Joint Programme on Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan held a round-table meeting in collaboration with the Senate and the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan, and civil society organizations. The meeting focused on the strengths, challenges faced by the national social protection system and the role of the Oliy Majlis in strengthening of the social protection system in Uzbekistan.
“Today we pay special attention to ensuring social protection of the population, which is one of the key goals of sustainable development. A key role is given to ensuring employment opportunities to the population, especially to women and youth. We believe that the UN Joint Programme on strengthening social protection in Uzbekistan will keep on contributing to effective efforts toward achieving the goals.” - highlighted Ms. Tanzila Narbaeva, the Chairperson of the Senate of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
In the time of continuing COVID-19 pandemic around the world, social protection of population is defined as a key area of development in the state policy of Uzbekistan. Assisting population in getting appropriate social protection from the Government will ensure that every member of society, including children, mothers, persons with disabilities, workers, older persons, migrants, and minorities, enjoys her/his rights.
“UN Joint Programme supported by the Global Sustainable Development Fund for Social Protection harnesses the expertise of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) partnered with International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to assist the   Government of Uzbekistan in developing the National strategy on social protection, designing an effective legislative, institutional and monitoring mechanism for coordination and delivery of social protection, and significantly improving social protection of people with disabilities, this accelerating progress towards Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.”– stated Mr. Akmal Saidov, First Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
“As COVID-19 has once again exposed the importance of expanding social protection to the most vulnerable groups, we are pleased to witness political commitment on social protection in Uzbekistan and willingness of the Government to address issues of coordination and to define a long-term vision for the system reform. UNICEF, ILO and UNDP with support of the Joint SDG Fund and by joining efforts with partners like the World Bank continue supporting the Government in addressing issues of adequacy and low coverage of existing programs, e.g. cash assistance, social services,  insurance, pensions and active labour measures and following the principle of leaving no one behind” – noted Mr. Munir Mammadzade,  RC a.i., UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan.
Participants also discussed the social approach to disability assessment as an essential element of the effective social protection system. The approach removes barriers which prevent people with disabilities from participating in society, accessing work and living independently. It also recognizes that attitudes towards disabled people create unnecessary barriers to inclusion and requires people to take proactive action to remove these barriers.
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes that disability is an evolving concept and that disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.
In this context, participants welcomed the adoption of the Law on the rights of persons with disabilities, which guarantees rights and freedoms of the people with disabilities for decent living condition, education and employment.
“We need to work out specific mechanisms for realizing the rights of persons with disabilities for protection against discrimination, as it was stated in the new Law on the rights of persons with disabilities and was prescribed in the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health. We hope for productive cooperation in the field in the closest future.”– said Mr. Oybek Isakov, the Chairperson of the Association of Disabled People of Uzbekistan.
The participants also welcomed the efforts of Uzbekistan to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the application of the International Classification of Functioning, Disabilities and Health in Uzbekistan, will serve to implement comprehensive measures to further improve the system supporting the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities, strengthening guarantees for the protection of their rights and freedoms, including the right to social protection.

Title: UNICEF calls for inclusion of children and young persons with disabilities
Content: 03 December 2020
“This year’s commemoration comes at an extraordinary time; a time where COVID-19 has magnified inequalities and disrupted service for persons with disabilities,” said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan. “As we emerge out of this era, it is key to re-imagine approaches, policies, systems and services that will empower and not cut off children and young people with disabilities.”
Before the COVID 19 crisis, persons with disabilities were already facing significant inequalities in terms of poverty, education, health, work, and social participation. The COVID crisis has magnified those barriers and inequalities.
Emerging data shows that during COVID19, over 80 per cent of countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia reported disruptions in access to disability-related health services, while a quarter of countries reported disruptions in social protection systems for persons with disabilities. Further, at least half of countries, governments failed to adopt measures aimed at facilitating learning for children with disabilities
In Uzbekistan, current data shows that nearly 1 in 2 children with disabilities does not access to the universal disability benefit, mainly because of the costly and cumbersome system.
Opportunities are also scarce. For instance, among young people with disabilities, those who are not in education, employment or training constitute 77%, rising to 91% for people with a severe disability. Further, children with disabilities, especially girls with disabilities are more prone to drop out of school and to be out of school.
Meanwhile more needs to be done on inclusion, as official statistical data in Uzbekistan, shows that children with disabilities are significantly overrepresented in residential care institutions for children. Measures need to be taken to ensure the inclusion and the right of children to live with their families.
“We welcome the recent adoption of the Law “On the rights of persons with disabilities” and amendments to the Law on Education, which widen access to quality inclusive education for all children, said Mr. Mammadzade. “We hope that Uzbekistan will do one more step to ensure the full realization of the rights of girls and boys, women and men with disabilities and ratify the Convention.”
UNICEF advocates for the protection and promotion of universal children’s and women’s rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a key tool to advance these.

Title: COVID-19 reminds us that inclusivity is important
Content: 03 December 2020
In Uzbekistan and around the world, the International Day of Disabled Persons was observed on 3 December to promote the full and equal participation of persons with disabilities and to take action for the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of society and development.
In 2020 the special day took on heightened importance as the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately affecting people with disabilities. To address this challenge, the United Nations released a briefing report with recommended disability-inclusive response measures, calling for their special attention to this area as a vital part of achieving the pledge to leave no one behind, and a critical response to the global commitments of the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Agenda for Humanity and the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy.
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Doina Munteanu said supporting efforts to empower and include persons with disabilities is much more than just doing the right thing for them. “Ensuring everyone is able to actively participate in the economy, public service and civil affairs is a good way to accelerate a county’s development trajectory,” she said. “When everyone is empowered to exercise their full potential as creative human beings with ideas and knowledge to overcome societal challenges, the entire country benefits.”
This spring, Uzbekistan’s TV viewers saw an unfamiliar sight: a daily news broadcast featuring simultaneous sign-language translation for the first time. UNDP partnered with UzReport TV to provide this service, enabling those with hearing impairments to receive the government’s regular COVID-19 briefings. Initially part of broader efforts to reach vulnerable communities in social groups or rural areas, this initiative has proved to be an enormous success, and looks set to remain long after the pandemic ends.
UNDP has launched several initiatives to support the Government with its targeted response measures during the pandemic. For example, sign-language translation is being used to help expand access to psychological support for those who may benefit from it. Together with UzReport TV, UNDP has provided sign-language translation once a week for its popular psychological counselling show with Aziza Tashkhajaeva. This show is also broadcast on the radio channels Mahalla and Oriat Dono for those with sight impairment. A UNDP-supported radio programme on Radio Maxima, the “One of us” series, strives to increase public awareness of disability issues.
To make sure everyone has access to the right information to protect themselves, UNDP has  partnered with pharmacies, mahallas and homes for people with disabilities across the country to distribute braille pamphlets – for those with sight impairments – about the pandemic, and about gender-based violence. Another initiative involved a call for proposals from organizations working with disabled people. Eleven finalists received grants to launch and implement their small social initiatives.
Those with disabilities in Uzbekistan continue to face significant barriers in their daily life.  To support them, more resources are needed in accessible formats like braille, audio, large prints or electronic books for education, access to public resources and employment opportunities. For this, the 2013 Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled is an important step. So far, 76 countries have ratified the treaty, and Uzbekistan is encouraged to join them.
Global evidence confirms that impacts of crises are never gender-neutral, and COVID-19 is no exception. While everyone is facing unprecedented challenges, women are bearing the brunt of the economic and social fallout of COVID-19. In particular, women who are poor and with disabilities face an even higher risk of COVID-19 transmission and fatalities, loss of livelihood, and increased violence. In this regard, UNDP is conducting a situational analysis on women with disabilities during the pandemic to correctly evaluate the needs and to address them with tailored solutions.
UNDP recognizes that current assessments of disability are based on the medical model, which looks at what is 'wrong' with the person, not what the person needs. This approach focuses on impairment and not empowerment. “We believe it is better to remove unnecessary barriers which prevent people with disabilities from fully participating in society, accessing work and living independently,” said Munteanu. “This all-of-society approach benefits everyone, as everyone has something unique to contribute.”
As part of this effort, a series of trainings were conducted for members of the Medical-Labour Expertise Commission (MLEC) this year to master a smooth transformation from the medical to social approach in assessing, defining and measuring disability.
The pandemic has reminded us how public infrastructure could better accommodate persons with disabilities. To fully evaluate the challenges and opportunities in this area, UNDP in Uzbekistan recently conducted an analysis and provided recommendations on accessible and affordable public services for persons with disabilities.  It also is supporting efforts to further integrate women, men and children with disabilities into the civic process by generating greater public knowledge about the often invisible challenges affecting our neighbors, colleagues and loved ones with disabilities.

Title: Every move counts towards better health – says WHO
Content: 28 November 2020
The new guidelines recommend at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week for all adults, including people living with chronic conditions or disability, and an average of 60 minutes per day for children and adolescents.
WHO statistics show that one in four adults, and four out of five adolescents, do not get enough physical activity.  Globally this is estimated to cost US$54 billion in direct health care and another US$14 billion to lost productivity.
The guidelines encourage women to maintain regular physical activity throughout pregnancy and post-delivery. They also highlight the valuable health benefits of physical activity for people living with disabilities.
Older adults (aged 65 years or older) are advised to add activities which emphasize balance and coordination, as well as muscle strengthening, to help prevent falls and improve health.
Regular physical activity is key to preventing and helping to manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer, as well as reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, reducing cognitive decline, improving memory and boosting brain health.
“Being physically active is critical for health and well-being – it can help to add years to life and life to years,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Every move counts, especially now as we manage the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must all move every day – safely and creatively.”
All physical activity is beneficial and can be done as part of work, sport and leisure or transport (walking, wheeling and cycling), but also through dance, play and everyday household tasks, like gardening and cleaning.
“Physical activity of any type, and any duration can improve health and wellbeing, but more is always better,” said Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of Health Promotion, World Health Organization, “and if you must spend a lot of time sitting still, whether at work or school, you should do more physical activity to counter the harmful effects of sedentary behaviour.”
“These new guidelines highlight how important being active is for our hearts, bodies and minds, and how the favourable outcomes benefit everyone, of all ages and abilities”, said Dr Fiona Bull, Head of the Physical Activity Unit which led the development of the new WHO guidelines.
WHO encourages countries to adopt the global guidelines to develop national health policies in support of the WHO Global action plan on physical activity 2018-2030. The plan was agreed by global health leaders at the 71st World Health Assembly in 2018 to reduce physical inactivity by 15% by 2030.

Title: UNICEF, ILO and UNDP report on their joint efforts to support the national social protection system
Content: 27 November 2020
Co-chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance and UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan, the Annual Reporting and Donors Meeting hosted over 40 participants from the relevant government ministries, national stakeholders, including the Federation of Trade Unions of Uzbekistan, Confederation of Employees of Uzbekistan, Association of the Disabled People of Uzbekistan, as well as international donor organizations and the UN agencies.
“The people of Uzbekistan, like billions of people around the world, faced a number of challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government has made significant successful attempts to mitigate the consequences of the crisis. Together with the international community, we seek to build a social protection system which will be resilient to the pandemic and other disasters, and support people in any circumstances. The UN Joint Programme is one of such tools we are using on our way,” – Mr. Jamshid Abruev, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
In January 2020 UNICEF, ILO and UNDP launched the joint programme with the Government of Uzbekistan on strengthening social protection system in Uzbekistan. The programme aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the social protection system in Uzbekistan as envisioned in 2020 State Programme. The programme supports Uzbekistan in: i) developing National Strategy on Social Protection; ii) designing an effective institutional setup for interagency coordination in policy making and delivery of social protection; and iii) introducing best international practices in disability assessment and social protection of vulnerable and most at risk population in line with the key principle of the 2030 Agenda ‘Leaving No One Behind’.
“The UN Joint Programme on Strengthening Social Protection is a fantastic opportunity to reduce fragmentation in the social protection system of Uzbekistan. Spending on social protection should be seen as an investment into achieving the national sustainable development priorities, including in the area of reducing poverty and inequality (SDG1 and SDG10), ensuring healthy lives and wellbeing (SDG 3), gender equality (SDG 5), as well as decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). Investments in social protection also help ensure that no one is left behind, and also focus on such often-neglected group as people with disabilities, who are an important and integral part of our society,” - Ms. Helena Fraser, UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan.
In 2020, the UN Joint Programme established strategic partnership with key national stakeholders. In consultation with relevant ministries and agencies, the Joint Programme developed concepts of the National strategy of social protection and institutional reform options. It conducted capacity building training courses on introduction of ICF (International Classification of Functioning) on disability assessment, as well as launched a micro-grants initiative for civil society organizations of persons with disabilities to support the local user-led social initiatives.
“Jointly with the Government of Uzbekistan, we are working on building a strong coordination mechanism in the field. A strong social protection system is able to reduce the life-long irreversible impact of poverty on children,” said Mr. Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan. “In order to take advantage of the demographic dividend in the future, Uzbekistan must start making appropriate investment into its children and youth, today.”
“By drafting the concept of national social protection strategy, under the coordination of the Ministry of Finance, constituents have made significant first step towards designing comprehensive national social protection system. The national strategy will ensure that people enjoy income security and have effective access to health and other social services and are empowered to take advantage of economic opportunities. These polices will play a key role in boosting domestic demand, supporting the transformation of enterprises, promoting decent work, and fostering inclusive and sustainable growth which is fundamental to realizing the human right to social security for all," – Ms. Olga Koulaeva, Director of the ILO Decent Work Team and Country Office for Eastern Europe and Central Asia
“Working in close collaboration with Organizations of Persons with Disabilities, the UNDP aims to ensure that the social protection system is inclusive and provides opportunity for equal participation to all members of the society. The Pillar 3 of the UN Joint Programme on Social Protection aims to re-examine the disability assessment and determination process in Uzbekistan to provide better access to services for persons with disabilities. We continue supporting the Government of Uzbekistan in the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,” – Ms. Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan.
“The SDG Fund welcomes the adoption of the new law "On the rights of persons with disabilities" in Uzbekistan. We will assist the government in the adoption of disability inclusive national strategy on social protection. We believe that no society will ever achieve the sustainable development goals without the full and inclusive integration and participation of all human beings, including people with disabilities,” – highlighted Ms. Lisa Kurbiel, Head of the Joint SDG Fund Secretariat.
In 2021, the Joint Programme, in partnership with the Government and key national partners, will develop and approve a National strategy of social protection, costed institutional design concept for the integrated social protection system, launch pilots on introduction of ICF in disability assessment and community-based social services, strengthen capacity of the Government staff on delivering integrated social protection, further develop and operationalize the Single Registry, a management information system for social protection.
After the Joint Programme presentation, participants discussed future possible developments in the field and provided their expert advice on the improvement of the activities planned in 2021.

Title: FAO provides agriculture equipment to low-income smallholders of Kashkadarya region
Content: 21 November 2020
Earlier on 11 November, the agriculture equipment was delivered to smallholders of Bukhara region. Technical support was provided within the framework of “Integrated Natural Resources Management in Drought-prone and Salt-affected Agricultural Production Systems in Central Asia and Turkey” (CACILM-2) project, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan supported by Global Environment Facility (GEF).
On 17 November, the next equipment handover ceremony took place in Kamashi district of Kashkadarya region. 14 water pumps and 5 motor-cultivators were given to smallholders of the region.
It should be noted that water pumps play an important role in guaranteed supply of irrigation and the rational use of water. Motor-cultivators are also excellent helpers in tillage, including  fertilizing and preparing soil for sowing, improving the structure of soil.
Within the framework of the project, it is also planned to build 14 greenhouses on personal plots of the Kamashi district.
“Due to the pandemic, food markets have faced certain difficulties, but it is the agri-food sector that must demonstrate the greatest resilience to the crisis. The representatives of the sphere have already gained experience of working in the conditions of the global crisis, now they are better informed and prepared. And FAO Representation in Uzbekistan is actively working on contribution to ensure food security” said professor Aziz Nurbekov, FAO National Consultant on Drought Risk Management.
The fight against hunger and malnutrition is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and one of the main of FAO’s mandate. This goal is also aimed by the project “Integrated Natural Resources Management in Drought-prone and Salt-affected Agricultural Production Systems in Central Asia and Turkey”.

Title: UNICEF Launches Situation Analysis on Uzbekistan Children and warns that COVID 19 pandemic can erode gains made on Children’s Rights
Content: 20 November 2020
On World Children's Day, UNICEF has launched a new Situational Analysis of Children in Uzbekistan report and warned that the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to unravel gains made and worsen outcomes for the most vulnerable children across the country.
Conducted with the engagement of key stakeholders, including representatives of line ministries, CSOs, academia, donors and the private sector, the analysis showed encouraging trends in the areas of child survival, eradication of child labour and improvements in early child education. However, the report also showed worrying trends in reaching the poorest children and children with disabilities with social protection measures, nutrition of pregnant women and mental health of teenagers.
“The launch of the report is timely. As the world at large and Uzbekistan grapples with a COVID-19 pandemic - with missed education, worsening malnutrition, limited water and sanitation facilities and rapidly rising child poverty, we need information, data and evidence to make sound decisions, interventions and arrest potentially catastrophic outcomes for children,” said Munir Mammadzade, UNICEF Representative in Uzbekistan.
The findings of the analysis have confirmed that structural barriers should be examined and removed. These are inefficiencies in budget allocation, hidden costs such as out-of-pocket expenditures in health care, unbalanced investments for different age groups in social protection and education and often insufficient budgets to meet standards.
These findings come against a backdrop of increased child poverty due to the economic impact by COVID-19. The report underlines the importance of covering youth, children living in poor families and institutions.  It also recommends for the establishment of a multidimensional measure of child poverty to assess the combination of various deprivations experienced by children in their daily lives – such as poor health, lack of education, inadequate living standards, disempowerment, the threat of violence, and living in areas that are environmentally hazardous, among others. Hence, will help to develop better informed and target policies for poverty reduction.
Further, the report identifies critical priorities, as well as the new emerging issues to further advance children rights in Uzbekistan and will aid UNICEF, the Government of Uzbekistan and partners to ensure the progressive realization of the rights of children in Uzbekistan to survival, development, education, social security, child protection and participation.

Title: Coca-Cola Foundation funds 165 oxygen concentrators to treat COVID-19 patients in Karakalpakstan
Content: 18 November 2020
Earlier this year the Coca-Cola Foundation allocated a grant of $200,000 to be used in procuring ventilators and other medical equipment, as a key part of UNDP’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Uzbekistan. UNDP has also provided four ICU ventilators through the same grant by Coca-Cola Foundation currently being used to treat the most severe cases.
Oxygen concentrators are a non-invasive way of providing oxygen to patients hospitalized with the COVID-19 virus. This supplemental oxygen is the first essential step undertaken for treating the low blood oxygen levels of patients with acute cases and is the primary component of treatment at this stage.
Following necessary administrative steps undertaken by authorities, the 165 procured oxygen concentrators will be distributed out to all 16 district health departments and Nukus city health department in Karakalpakstan, which will in turn reduce the burden placed on the region’s centralized republican medical institutions.
UNDP Uzbekistan has been cooperating with the Coca-Cola Foundation since 2011. Five projects have received $505,000 in funding from the Coca-Cola Foundation in the past. Those projects were successfully implemented in remote rural areas of Samarkand, Navoi and Karakalpakstan in cooperation with national agencies and organizations.
UNDP has committed considerable personnel and resources to supporting Uzbekistan in limiting the national spread of COVID-19, and mitigating the negative consequences it may have on vulnerable population groups and economies.
Since March, UNDP has been working with national partners to counter not just the immediate health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also its socio-economic consequences and particularly those experienced intensively in Karakalpakstan and the Aral Sea region.
This responsive work has ranged from providing assistance to vulnerable persons including marginalized women, informally employed people and people living with disabilities, to ensuring that small businesses can sustain themselves, and that adequate PPE and sanitary products remain available to all citizens.
Together with national partners including Coca-Cola Foundation UNDP has been closely monitoring the pandemic’s nationwide impacts, and contributing to the formulation of a comprehensive strategy to help Uzbekistan build forward better.

Title: FAO supports Uzbekistan during the pandemic
Content: 13 November 2020
Although in Uzbekistan the pandemic has not led to significant disruptions in agriculture due to the necessary measures timely taken by the government of the country, risks still exist. The incomes of the rural population are under threat.
It is well known that poverty reduction is the first of 17 Sustainable Development Goals. This goal is ultimately pursued by the project “Integrated Natural Resources Management in Drought-prone and Salt-affected Agricultural Production Systems in Central Asia and Turkey” (CACILM-2), implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
In June 2020, in the scope of the project, 30,000 seedlings of tomato, cabbage and bell pepper were delivered to people living in rural areas of Bukhara district of Bukhara region, in addition in July, more than 10 tons of fertilizers were delivered for agriculture purposes as well. This has provided significant support for financially strained smallholders of Bukhara region during the pandemic.
“Measures to support the most vulnerable groups of the population, to maintain the functioning of global food supply chains and to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic throughout the food system will prevent a food crisis in this difficult period”, said the national project manager Muhammadjon Kosimov.
Additionally, Bukhara district khokimiyat (municipality) in cooperation with the regional department of agriculture have formed the list of low-income families to be supported. Based on this list, the FAO Representation in Uzbekistan provided 17 water pumps to farmer families.
At the same time, within the framework of the CACILM-2 project, 4 motor-cultivators were transferred to the Bukhara region for the processing of personal plots. The equipment handover ceremony took place on November 11, 2020. It was emphasized that this equipment plays an important role in obtaining a sustainable harvest and in the efficient use of household land.
“I express my gratitude for the significant support provided to dekhkans and households in the difficult period of the pandemic and I want to note that the rural population of the Bukhara district is very interested in further development of cooperation”, said the khokim (governor) of the Bukhara district Kakhramon Dustov.
FAO will continue to provide support, and within the framework of the CACILM-2 project, it is also planned to support building of 20 greenhouses in this area with the purpose of increasing the income of rural population and further greenhouse agriculture development.

Title: UNHCR urges states to end limbo for stateless people by 2024
Content: 11 November 2020
Marking the sixth anniversary of UNHCR’s #IBelong Campaign, aimed at ending statelessness by 2024, Grandi called on world leaders to include and protect stateless populations and make bold and swift moves to eradicate statelessness.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has shown more than ever the need for inclusion and the urgency to resolve statelessness. A pandemic doesn’t discriminate between citizens and non-citizens. It is not in any state’s, society’s or community’s interest for people to be left stateless and living on the margins of society,’ Grandi said.
“We must redouble efforts to resolve this affront to humanity in the 21st century.”
Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan) have made significant progress in eradicating statelessness, resolving more than 78,000 cases of statelessness in 2014-2019. In 2020, Uzbekistan adopted the new Law “On Citizenship”, from which more than 50,000 stateless persons can benefit and have their citizenship recognized. The new provisions, which came into force on April 1, 2020, will confer citizenship to registered stateless people who were granted permanent residence in Uzbekistan before 1 January 1995.
Lacking important legal rights and often unable to access essential services, many stateless people are politically and economically marginalized, discriminated against and vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. In many countries, stateless people, including stateless refugees, live in sub-standard and inadequate sanitary conditions which can increase the risk of disease.
Though global data is hard to obtain as stateless populations are not always accounted for or included in national censuses, some 4.2 million stateless people are reported by UNHCR in 76 countries. The actual number is believed, however, to be substantially higher.
While significant progress has been made in reducing statelessness worldwide since the launch of the campaign in November 2014, the coronavirus pandemic has now exacerbated many of the difficulties and injustices that stateless people face.
“Without citizenship, many stateless people do not have access to or are not included in essential public health services and social safety nets. They have been left extremely vulnerable in the face of this pandemic,” said Grandi.
Some countries have, however, shown leadership by including stateless people in their response to COVID-19, ensuring they have access to testing and treatment, food, clothing and masks.  Some governments have made birth registration and other forms of civil documentation an essential service, maintaining operations despite the pandemic, helping to prevent new cases of statelessness arising.
“Statelessness is an easily resolvable and preventable issue – a matter of political will to change a person’s status and life - yet the consequences of inaction especially during the middle of a pandemic can be life-threatening,” said Grandi.
“To protect and save lives, we urge governments to resolve statelessness and make sure that no one is left behind.”

Title: Applying data on COVID-19’s national impacts to families and businesses
Content: 11 November 2020
This event was hosted by the Development Strategy Center of Uzbekistan, jointly with the Center for Economic Research and Reforms (CERR), the World Bank, the Ministry of Mahalla and Family Affairs, and UNDP.
In order to refine Uzbekistan’s nationwide response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown, UNDP has collaborated with CERR and the Ministry of Mahalla and Family Affairs to measure the socio-economic impacts on families, and limitations posed to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The purpose of today’s digital conference has been to present these findings to key decision-makers and determine next steps for using the discovered data. It was suggested the latter should become a basis for future policy frameworks and legislation seeking to minimize COVID-19’s impacts, and inform Uzbekistan’s continued recovery from the pandemic.
The study of COVID-19’s socio-economic impacts on households took place from May to June, 2020, surveying mahalla (neighbourhood) leadership across all regions of Uzbekistan. The survey’s 3,670 respondents including mahalla chairpersons (84.7%), their deputies (12.8%), and mahalla activists (2.5%), 62.9% of whom are from rural mahallas. The survey’s findings found that the pandemic had increased numbers of impoverished families, particularly in urban areas.
Those households most acutely impacted included low-income families (noted by 48% of respondents particularly in Namangan and Samarkand), large families (noted by 40% of respondents particularly in the Tashkent region), and those with returned labour migrants (noted by 55% of respondents particularly in Jizzakh and Kashkadarya). These negative impacts mainly included reduced incomes and job loss, noted by 74% and 58% of respondents, respectively.
This study determined that material assistance such as the distribution of food packages, most required by women and the elderly was considered of greater importance than volunteer assistance. Recommendations for addressing socio-economic impacts included:
·       Altering measures of economic and social policy to encourage the private sector to import or produce required goods locally;
·       Encouraging youth and women to engage in family entrepreneurship by supporting the creation of small private businesses in mahallas;
·       Making it easier for women and girls to access assistance and have their concerns heard;
·       Ensuring the media emphasize the absence of danger from people who have had COVID-19 treatment.
A parallel survey considered the COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts on SMEs nationwide, based on 887 interviews of businesses throughout Uzbekistan. It determined that the most-impacted SMEs were in the tourism, hospitality and catering sectors, and those based in Sirdarya, Namangan, Navoi, Tashkent City and Karakalpakstan, while agriculture, forestry and fishery businesses were the least impacted. Businesses most challenged by the pandemic are those that have been unable to operate remotely, either due to an inability to transfer work processes, or a lack of internet access or required equipment.
The report on this second survey recommended that assistance provided to SMEs should include eliminating bottlenecks in business development, reducing tax burdens, improving access to financial assistance by creating an institutional environment for reducing the lending rate, and supporting transitions to remote work.
The videoconference held on November 11 presented the methodologies and findings of these studies, and detailed strategic objectives for poverty reduction, including supporting families in most need of assistance (as listed in ‘iron notebooks’), and applying means to address unemployment problems. Commitment was attained from all participants to utilize study results in developing new legislation and policy to enhance socio-economic recovery in Uzbekistan.

Title: Europe and Central Asia call for more sustainable and innovative agriculture
Content: 04 November 2020
During the three days of the virtual Conference hosted by Uzbekistan, 31 ministers and vice-ministers from 51 countries actively participated in the discussions, in addition to other 270 delegates and 50 observers from governments, International Organizations, other UN agencies and various partners. More than 1500 people were daily watching the webcast of the Conference.
"This first virtual FAO Regional Conference in this region has been a great success also due to the engagement with non-state actors, partner organizations, civil society, and - for the first time - the private sector," said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, who noted that the new virtual modality has also helped to "move away from formalities and focus on the substance."
During the discussions, Members committed to a positive outcome at the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021, while stressing that the world is not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The Conference recognized the need to pay special attention to the empowerment of rural youth and women, and the strengthening of rural services and infrastructure to ensure inclusive sustainable development, the empowerment of smallholder farmers, and green growth.
Transforming food systems and rural areas
In their interventions, Members emphasized that agri-food systems should be resilient and sustainable, and function under any circumstances, even in the midst of a pandemic. They acknowledged the importance of adopting a food systems approach for healthy diets, taking into account the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic and social), as a key commitment in achieving the SDGs.
The importance of innovation, research and well-functioning agricultural extension services have been identified as a prerequisite to ensure farmers and small enterprises can access knowledge and technology, as well as to take advantage of new opportunities that digital technologies offer to improve not only the productivity and sustainability of food systems, but also their transparency for consumers.
Members called on FAO to support, through its Regional Initiatives, the development and implementation of the transformative agenda on sustainable agri-food systems and healthy diets, which includes addressing specific impacts of COVID-19. FAO will support countries by providing relevant analysis and data on the current status of diets and food systems, as well as to build and share knowledge.
Smallholders and family farmers remain key pillars of the region's rural areas and food production throughout the pandemic. To this end, the FAO COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme offers countries a framework to provide tailor-made solutions, and mobilize investments for small family farms' and youth entrepreneurship, as well as public infrastructure, digital technologies, climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as social protection.
Members welcomed and supported FAO's new approach to agricultural development laid out in the Hand-in-Hand Initiative. They recognized the role it can play in strengthening the countries' ownership to accelerate progress to end poverty and hunger, as well as promote rural development and economic growth. In this regard, they also emphasized the benefit for innovation of improved data use for informed decision-making, and highlighted the importance of data protection and privacy.
For the period of 2020-2021, Members requested FAO to deeply integrate the One Health approach, including tackling antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic and other transboundary pests and diseases, promote equality and digital inclusion, social protection and school feeding and nutrition programmes, as well as ensuring the link between sustainable production and healthy and safe nutrition in its work.
45 years of promoting food security and nutrition
The Conference hosted an open discussion on the ways the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) helps countries of the region advance food security and nutrition. A new set of voluntary guidelines on food systems and nutrition was presented at the special event. These guidelines have the potential to become a key reference document to address food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms from a food systems perspective.
"FAO is proud to host the CFS Secretariat in Rome," the FAO Director-General said. "Considering its 45 years of experience, the CFS should be more incorporated into FAO's work on food security and nutrition, as an important inclusive international and intergovernmental platform."
With food loss and waste increasing due to movement and transport restrictions caused by COVID-19, Qu noted the potential role of the Committee in tackling the growing problem of food loss and waste, at a time when global hunger is on the rise.
Thanawat Tiensin, CFS Chairperson and Permanent Representative of Thailand to the Rome-based Agencies, briefed the Regional Conference participants on the main activities the Committee is planning to carry out in the coming years. He expressed concern about the negative impact of COVID-19 on agrifood supply chains and food security that are further impairing the achievement of the global goals.
"We must act to address the pressing challenges of today," said Tiensin in his message. "CFS policy tools exist to help countries progress towards the achievement of SDG 2 on zero hunger, and the 2030 Agenda. Countries and stakeholders need to participate actively and constructively in the Committee's dialogue, and gain full ownership of the outcome," he added.
During the panel discussion, North Macedonia's Minister of Justice Bojan Marichik noted that the Western Balkan countries are taking steps to advance gender equality in land ownership and control. He added that the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, and other international instruments, including the FAO Legal Assessment Tool and the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Tenure (VGGT) are key in achieving this objective.
The representative of the CFS Civil Society Mechanism, Isa Alvarez, emphasized the importance for the guidelines to be based on science and evidence, benefitting the people, who feed our world.
Katarina Eriksson from the CFS Private Sector Mechanism expressed her appreciation for the participatory process to develop the food systems and nutrition guidelines, calling them a "good example of how the CFS works."
At the closing session of the Regional Conference, the Director-General and the delegates thanked the Republic of Uzbekistan for hosting the virtual event. The Director-General Qu Dongyu gave special thanks to Jamshid Khodjaev, Agriculture Minister of Uzbekistan, who chaired the Conference.

Title: FAO Regional Conference for Europe
Content: 26 October 2020
The move to a virtual format followed consultations with the FAO Director-General and the Regional Group of Permanent Representatives. It is being done with the concurrence of the host country, Uzbekistan.
The Regional Conference for Europe will be conducted on the Zoom videoconferencing platform. Instructions regarding registration will be provided in the letter of invitation and on this website.
Participation in the Zoom virtual conference will be by invitation only, but the Regional Conference will be webcast for public viewing.
The 32nd Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Europe (ERC) is open to all FAO Members in the Europe and Central Asia region, to representatives of the United Nations Bodies and Specialized Agencies, and to selected Observers.
In light of the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit 2021 the ERC will focus on the Sustainable Food Systems and Healthy Diets in Europe and Central Asia as one of the main topics. The debate in the Roundtable will aim at outlining the status of nutrition and sustainable food systems, identifying the interlinkages and the related challenges and opportunities in the region and the contribution of the ERC to the UNFSS. The assessment of existing public policies related to nutrition and the sustainability of food systems will provide the basis of region-specific recommendations and pathways to transition to more sustainable food systems for healthy diets.
Linked to a food systems approach another main topic for discussion on the first day of the Conference will be “Solutions for Youth, Employment and Developing Rural Areas in relation to the United Nations Decade of Family Farming”. The discussion aims at underlining that smallholder and family farms are an integral part for ensuring long-term food security, rural poverty reduction and social and environmental sustainability in Europe and Central Asia. A situation analysis of smallholders, family farms and rural youth in agriculture will be presented under this agenda item, including a review of strategies that can potentially foster the revitalization of rural areas in the region. Finally, the roles for FAO and member countries in developing family farms and youth will be explored.
Furthermore, a standard important item on the agenda will be the Priorities for further work in the Region, which are influenced by the COVID-19 crisis and thus FAO’s priorities will reflect this.

Title: UN system in Uzbekistan and Government of Uzbekistan celebrate 75th anniversary   of the United Nations
Content: 23 October 2020
2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. To commemorate this occasion, in January 2020, UN Secretary-General António Guterres launched a global and inclusive conversation with the hashtag #UN75, to examine the role of global cooperation in building the future we want and the UN we need.
In March 2020, the UN system in Uzbekistan, together with the Government of Uzbekistan, launched the #UN75 campaign, within the framework of the Decade of Action for Agenda 2030. Since then, in partnership with the Government and civil society, the United Nations system in Uzbekistan has held 48 dialogues with more than 5,500 participants across Uzbekistan, including vulnerable groups. More than 34,000 people in Uzbekistan have taken the global #UN75 survey.
The purpose of these dialogues has been to reach the public and to listen to their hopes and fears. The UN will learn from their experience and insights in order to inform its global and country-level activities as it strives to accelerate the achievement of Agenda 2030 and the SDGs.
As noted, more than 34,000 people in Uzbekistan have taken the global #UN75 survey.
Below is a snapshot of answers to the #UN75 survey from respondents in Uzbekistan:
In 2045 people will be 1) better off, 2) worse off or 3) the same as today
At the virtual event, the Ministry of Culture of Uzbekistan presented the video clip “Human” dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. It’s based on a poem by renowned Uzbek poet, Erkin Vohidov, with lyrics in Arabic, English, Italian, Kazakh, Russian, Tajik, Turkish & Uzbek.
The song is a call to humanity to step up to our responsibility to protect our planet, and to recognize some of the powerful contradictions of being human. The message, sung in so many languages, and re-enforced by a dramatic video, reminds us of the need to think globally and act together to improve our world.
The United Nations in Uzbekistan
Uzbekistan joined the United Nations on 2 March 1992 as a new sovereign and independent state. The United Nations Office opened in Tashkent the following year. The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Uzbekistan comprises 24 UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes working together to advance national development priorities in line with the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: UNDP’s assistance in digitalizing the mahalla system
Content: 23 October 2020
The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated digitalization in many countries. In particular the unplanned shift to online work has accelerated the process of change in providing public services, which is currently very overloaded. The importance of creating online platforms for collaboration has been highlighted by the current crisis. In 2020, according to the UN, e-governance has improved in over 22% of countries around the world.
President Shavkat Mirziyoyev recently noted that executives of all levels in Uzbekistan should undertake the digitalization process in their daily tasks. “People should feel these transformations in reducing bureaucracy and corruption, in accelerating the provision of public services,” he has said.
As public services must continue functioning effectively both during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, countries need to develop their digital infrastructures and educate people to use digital technologies, which will lead to the better provision of human rights and the meeting of basic needs.
UNDP, with financial support from the Government of Japan, has provided technical assistance to the Ministry for Support of Mahallas and Families in forming digital infrastructure and services. These are critical for developing social services to support women and socially-vulnerable groups of the population, increasing the efficiency of services, and expanding the role of mahallas in the population’s social life.
In particular, to ensure effective information exchange between the ministry and citizens' self-government bodies, there are plans to introduce an electronic document management system which will reduce the time required to process data, and will positively impact the speed and quality of public services provision. 100 mahallas have been identified for the pilot launch, and it is planned that the system be tested as part of their daily work.
In addition, to improve the ministry’s technical capabilities in providing social support to citizens (including women affected by violence, unemployed citizens in need of advanced training and assistance in finding suitable work, and socially-vulnerable families), there are plans to develop and implement a unified database of the Ministry for Support of Mahallas and Families. This system will collect and analyze information that will create a decision-making mechanism based on relevant data, which will help prioritize the delivery of social support to those in need. The collected data will also be made available to other government agencies, for undertaking analysis on relevant issues.
At the first stage of the system’s implementation the official website of the ministry was developed and tested, which can be found at https://moqqv.uz. On the website one can find information about the activities of the ministry, and related news and documents. The site will help improve communication between the ministry and the people.
To support the work of the above information systems UNDP will provide appropriate server and computer equipment to the Ministry for Support of Mahallas and Families, within the framework of the technical assistance project plans. It also plans to provide 100 laptops and routers, creating opportunities for engagement with the electronic document management system for employees of citizens' self-government bodies.

Title: UNDP Uzbekistan handed over Coca-Cola funded ventilators to treat COVID-19 patients
Content: 21 October 2020
Soon after COVID-19 appeared in Uzbekistan, the Coca-Cola Foundation allocated a grant of $200,000 to be used in providing ventilators and other medical equipment, as part of humanitarian relief efforts. UNDP has been entrusted to deliver this equipment to regions of Uzbekistan which have required the most medical assistance.
At a Tashkent ceremony, Director of the Coca-Cola Foundation in Uzbekistan Shadab Akhmed Khan and UNDP Resident Representative Matilda Dimovska officially delivered the ventilators to Yahyo Soliev, representative of Karakalpakstan’s Ministry of Health. The ventilators are now being transported to Nukus, capital of the Karakalpakstan region, and are expected to arrive on October, 22.
Essential contributions of medical equipment funded by Coca-Cola is aimed to help ensuring the best chances of survival for patients in Uzbekistan and has supported the country’s surge capacity to deliver testing services.
“It is encouraging to see that our cooperation has grown during these difficult times of the human crisis caused by COVID-19. This event has tied us together. This crisis has inspired our solidarity in supporting the people of Karakalpakstan, and in improving their health and well-being,” said Ms. Dimovska at her opening remarks.
“We have a history of successful cooperation with UNDP on other philanthropic projects in Uzbekistan and we are delighted to be cooperating with them again on this donation. Today we are happy to pass our first batch of the equipment, artificial ventilators, to the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. We hope that this vital equipment will help to save lives. We express our infinite gratitude to the healthcare professionals who are on the front line. We do believe that soon the situation will get better and the values we are displaying of solidarity, agility, caring for our people and communities will continue to endure,” said Mr Shadab.

Title: UNECE calls upon Uzbekistan to use the recommendations of its Environmental Performance Review for designing its green recovery policies in the aftermath of COVID-19
Content: 20 October 2020
Reducing its dependence on fossil fuels by tapping its immense potential for solar electricity, increasing efforts to reduce water losses in agriculture, a sector that represents 32.4 % of GDP (2018), and extending the protected area network are amongst the key recommendations of the Third Environmental Performance Review (EPR) of Uzbekistan prepared under the auspices of UNECE. The Review equips the Government with 99 recommendations to improve the environmental situation and the wellbeing of the population, while greening the energy, agriculture, transport, housing, industry and health sectors.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has reconfirmed our dependence on nature. It heightened the importance of finding sustainable solutions for environmental issues. I invite Uzbekistan to use the EPR recommendations on a clean energy transition, sustainable agriculture, sustainable management of natural resources and green economy for designing its green recovery policies. I also urge international partners to support Uzbekistan in implementation of EPR recommendations”, said Olga Algayerova, UNECE Executive Secretary.
Uzbekistan has made significant progress in recent years …
The EPR highlights areas in which Uzbekistan is particularly strong and describes many successes of the past decade, such as the electrification of railways, ongoing municipal waste management reform, the introduction of enterprise-specific targets to reduce energy consumption, investments to expand water supply and sanitation and environmental education. Adherence by Uzbekistan to the Sustainable Development Goals through the adoption of national goals, targets and indicators is also highlighted. The Review includes an assessment of country’s progress in relation to 64 targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The EPR underscores the Government’s large-scale efforts to tackle the consequences of the Aral Sea disaster, which has brought a large burden of disease and disability on the population, in particular in the Aral Sea region. The EPR commends Uzbekistan for the afforestation campaigns conducted in the dried bed of the Aral Sea and for the support the Government provides to engineering works aimed at landscaping the Amudarya River delta for the restoration of aquatic and wetland ecosystems. The EPR welcomes the establishment upon the initiative of Uzbekistan of the Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region – an unprecedented attempt to increase the effectiveness and impact of Government and donor projects in the Aral Sea region of the country. The Review underscores that efficient functioning and transparency in the operation of the Trust Fund are prerequisites for maintaining credibility and increasing interest from the international community towards this mechanism.
… but many challenges remain
The 2017 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Uzbekistan stipulates a target to decrease emissions of GHGs per unit of GDP by 10 per cent by 2030, relative to 2010 levels. Considering the projected growth of the population (from 32.7 million people in 2018 to 37 million in 2030) and the pre-COVID-19 rates of economic growth, it is highly likely that overall GHG emissions will increase significantly by 2030, even if the mitigation target of the NDC is reached. The energy sector is responsible for 82 per cent (in 2012) of GHG emissions and must therefore be the main target of mitigation measures. In recent years, a World Bank project has greatly contributed to energy efficiency in many industrial enterprises but energy losses in the industrial sector at large continue to be high. In 2019, there was no renewable energy (other than hydro) generation in Uzbekistan, except for some off-grid or small-scale units, despite the country’s enormous potential for solar energy generation, estimated at 2 million GWh per year.
Agriculture consumes around 89–92 per cent of water used in Uzbekistan. Around one third of the water used in the sector is lost due to inadequate irrigation techniques and obsolete infrastructure. By reducing this loss, the country would be able to face the forecast water deficit and save enough water to mitigate the fluctuations in annual available water quantity. The crop diversification policy that has been central to the sector in the past decade should decrease water consumption. The Government subsidizes the installation of water-saving techniques by farmers. In 2019, the total area under water-saving irrigation techniques amounted to 9.6 per cent of irrigated lands. Increasing efforts to reduce water losses in agriculture is among key priorities identified by the EPR.
In 2017, Uzbekistan concluded a framework agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to enable the operation of the Environmental Remediation Account for Central Asia. This will allow the remediation of the Charkesar and Yangiabad uranium tailings – the most dangerous sites left by past uranium production. In 2019, Uzbekistan joined the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) to benefit from international expertise and assistance in the management of obsolete pesticides and other POPs. The EPR notes that the country’s cooperation with donors on environmental and sustainable development issues has intensified in the past few years and calls upon Uzbekistan to join global and regional multilateral environmental agreements it is not yet party to.
The populations of widespread wild animal species are either stable or growing in Uzbekistan. However, there are decreasing trends in populations of several globally threatened or locally endemic fauna species. This is the case for the saiga antelope, marbled polecat, Pallas’s cat, Saker falcon, sociable lapwing, Egyptian vulture and many others. To prevent further biodiversity loss, Uzbekistan runs several species breeding centres. The Strategy for the Conservation of Biological Diversity for the period 2019–2028 aims to expand protected areas to 12 per cent of the national territory from the current 4.63 per cent. The EPR stresses the need to ensure that the protected area network encompasses all main ecosystem types and sufficiently covers habitats of rare and threatened species. Lake Tuzkan – part of the Aydar-Arnasay Lake System, which was declared a Ramsar site in 2008 under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention) – should continue to be protected.
Access to environmental information is crucial for further progress
The Review calls upon governmental authorities at all levels to make available online all information on environmental matters and develop detailed procedures for public participation in decision-making on planned activities and projects, as well as to ensure meaningful organization of public hearings. It also points out the need to simplify the procedures for the operation of environmental NGOs in line with international standards.
The Third EPR was organized by UNECE in cooperation with the State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection and other governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations of Uzbekistan. Hungary, Italy, Portugal, OECD, WHO, UNEP and UNECE delegated their experts for this EPR. Carrying out this Review was made possible with funding from Germany and Switzerland and overall support from the UN Country Team in Uzbekistan.

Title: Young people explore impacts of COVID-19 on poverty across the world and in Uzbekistan
Content: 16 October 2020
The event was organized by the UNDP and the World Bank in partnership with the Agency for Youth Affairs.
During the webinar, around 90 participants, representing various universities across the country, were informed about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, employment, remittances, wellbeing of citizens, the country’s education system, etc.
The UNDP and World Bank experts noted that global extreme poverty, which is defined as living on less than $1.90 a day, is expected to rise for the first time in over 20 years as a result of the pandemic. It will cause contraction in global per-capita GDP growth of between 5% and 8% that is estimated to push an additional 88 million to 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020.
The pandemic is the most severe crisis Uzbekistan has faced since the economy’s recovery from the breakup of the Soviet Union. It has almost entirely extinguished GDP growth. In 2020, it is projected to reach 0.6 percent compared with 5.6 percent a year ago.
The pandemic had a severe impact on the wellbeing of citizens and increased poverty levels in Uzbekistan. According to the World Bank estimates, as of August 2020, it dragged into poverty up to 900,000 additional people across the country.
The Government of Uzbekistan has been committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, including SDG1 to end poverty. Its efforts have reduced the national poverty rate from 24% in 2000 to 11% in 2019, lifting 2.2 million people out of poverty. However, the pandemic has countered these gains.
“Poverty is multidimensional and is closely tied up with social inequalities, like gender disparity, access to education, inadequate social protection, or discrimination of people with disabilities. Eliminating poverty does not just mean providing social assistance, but also building a more inclusive society”, noted Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative
While Uzbekistan tackles the pandemic’s impacts, now there is a chance to address poverty at its roots. There are four directions of change in Uzbekistan coming out of COVID-19, including job creation and social protection, green economy, digitalization of businesses and services, and enhancing governance to make a new social contract
“The COVID-19 crisis has become a turning point for developing countries like Uzbekistan. The main lesson learned is that people and businesses should be flexible, and able to change as circumstances demand,” said Alisher Sadullayev, Director of Youth Affairs Agency. “Life-long learning and investments in human capital can help the country move forward.”
“While Uzbekistan is experiencing the negative social and economic impact of the pandemic, we are confident that there are all necessary conditions to support an inclusive recovery and to accelerate the eradication of poverty in the future”, underlined Marco Mantovanelli, World Bank Country Manager for Uzbekistan, in the conclusion of the webinar.

Title: The Concept of the national strategy for social protection in Uzbekistan is published for online discussion
Content: 05 October 2020
The Concept of the Strategy, developed by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan jointly with the UN Joint Programme on Strengthening Social Protection, is available online for public discussion from 24 September till 9 October 2020.
Earlier this month, on 14 September 2020, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan jointly with the International Labour Organisation, one of the three agencies of the UN Joint Programme on Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan, introduced a draft Concept of the National Strategy for Social Protection (NSSP) to the Technical Working Group. The Group consisted of the representatives of Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Public Education, Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations, Ministry of Makhalla and Family Support, Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction, Pension Fund, General Prosecutor’s Office, social partners, UNICEF, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank,  and other international organizations.
Mr. Jamshid Abruev, Deputy Minister of Finance, the head of the Working Group, highlighted in his opening remarks that “adoption of the National Strategy for Social Protection is envisaged in the state programme for implementation of the National Action Strategy on five priority development areas 2017-2021.  Ministry of Finance has been entrusted by the Government to implement the NSSP jointly with the UN Joint Programme on Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan.”
Ms. Jasmina Papa, Social Protection Specialist, ILO Moscow, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic proved that social protection coverage plays a strategic role in social stability. Social protection is integral to achieving poverty reduction, maintaining living standards, achieving economic growth, and creating a functioning labour market. The Government’s approach to strengthening social protection is comprehensive, involving reforms in all three pillars: social assistance through the development of the social registry and reform of social benefits, labour, and jobs through the revamping of key labour market programmes and social insurance through the pensions reform. Comprehensive social protection strategies promote integrated approaches which define National Social Protection Floors (SPF). The SPF are nationally defined sets of basic social security guarantees which should ensure, at a minimum that, over the life cycle, all in need have access to basic income security and essential health care which together secure effective access to goods and services defined as necessary at the national level. Nationally defined SPF sets a ground for progressive extension of social protection, both horizontally – to as many people who need protection, and vertically –enabling achievement of higher levels of protection.
During the presentation, the national and international experts noted that fragmented institutional framework is the main reason for the weakness of the social protection system in Uzbekistan and its low effectiveness. Currently, social protection is provided by many ministries and agencies, including: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations, Ministry of Public Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction, Ministry of Mahalla and Family Affairs, Pension Fund. The quality leadership in social protection system integrates effectively social security, social assistance, social services and active labour market programmes into one comprehensive, accountable and effective system.
Experts also endorsed Uzbekistan’s efforts on expanding coverage of some social protection measures to cope the effects of shocks of poverty, unemployment and loss of livelihoods generated by COVID-19. It was also suggested that Uzbekistan will need to adapt and expand social protection measures to cope with short, medium and longer-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy. Unified Single Registry, developed by the Ministry of Finance jointly with UNICEF, launched in Syrdarya region and being expanded throughout Uzbekistan is expected to be one of   the core instruments of the National Strategy for Social Protection.
The discussed pillars of the Strategy’s Concept are included into the draft Decree of the President of Uzbekistan “On approving the Concept of the National Strategy for Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2021 – 2030” which is placed onto the state www.regulation.gov.uz portal for public discussion.
The UN Joint Programme, sponsored by Joint SDG Fund and implemented by ILO, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) jointly with the Government of Uzbekistan, aims to support the Government in building and delivering a high-quality social protection system that offers all citizens of Uzbekistan – in particular, those at risk of being left behind – income security and social support throughout their lives.

Title: Governments of Central Asia and the Caucasus call for strengthened cooperation on transport connectivity and use of UN instruments to accelerate COVID-19 recovery
Content: 30 September 2020
Enhancing connectivity and ensuring sustainable and efficient functioning of international transport corridors is of paramount importance for the economic recovery of landlocked countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, especially during the COVID-19 crisis which caused serious disruptions of supply chains and mobility.
This was the resounding message as Ministers and high-level national representatives from Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan – members of the UN Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA) – and Georgia, came together with UN partners, Multilateral Development Banks and international organizations for a Regional Dialogue led by UNECE on 29 September 2020.
Officials identified the most urgent measures to be implemented to enhance regional connectivity and support national economies’ rapid recovery, in the face of a contraction of the regional economy by 4.7% in 2020, according to World Bank forecasts.
Conclusions adopted stressed the importance of regional cooperation to promote the development of integrated multimodal transport systems (especially railways and intermodal connections) and completing missing infrastructure links connecting the participating countries to regional and Euro-Asian corridors.
Officials called on countries that have not yet done so to consider acceding to and implementing the United Nations legal instruments on inland transport – administered by UNECE – to enhance regional transport connectivity and maintain undisrupted supply-chains affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to further support their economic recovery. Countries are encouraged to implement digital solutions for cross-border facilitation (especially e-TIR and e-CMR and cross-border transport facilitation tools) to minimize human contact and lower transport and trade costs and border crossing waiting times.
Accelerating implementation of existing SPECA transport connectivity initiatives and harnessing sub-regional transport cooperation through SPECA Working Group on Sustainable Transport, Transit and Connectivity was further emphasized as a priority. UNECE Executive Secretary Olga Algayerova urged countries to harness such cooperation to fully realize their potential as transit countries on strategic Euro-Asian inland transport corridors to drive progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Stressing the significant investments made so far in development of transport infrastructure and improved legislative and institutional frameworks, she emphasized the importance of UNECE tools for more efficient, safe and environmentally friendly transport.
Being a landlocked country means you are reliant on global and regional collaboration;  countries cannot simply “go it alone”, stressed Ms. Fekita Utoikamanu, UN High Representative for Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries & Small Island Developing States. “The pandemic has shown us, over and over, the critical importance of connectivity of all kinds”, she said.
H.E. Mr. Rashid Meredov, Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet Ministers, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan, emphasized “the importance of continuing our joint efforts to enhance the use of existing legal instruments on the facilitation of transport and transit procedures”, stressing the “key role of the Conventions and multilateral agreements developed within the UNECE”. Seizing this potential, Turkmenistan has recently acceded to six of these instruments.
“Safeguarding uninterrupted supply chains through sustainable international transport and transit corridors is like preventing economic heart attacks. Establishing seamless and smooth flow of goods will reduce costs, stimulate demand and revitalize the economy”, said Ms. Gwi Yeop Son, UN Development Coordination Office Regional Director for Europe and CIS.
The dialogue’s conclusions encourage SPECA countries to keep transport supply chains going during the pandemic, especially for essential goods and services – including medical supplies, food products and ICT. Countries further stressed the need for regular exchange of information and continuous dialogue to ensure uninterrupted transport connectivity.

Title: World Health Organization and the European Union help the healthcare workers during COVID-19 in Uzbekistan
Content: 28 September 2020
The project, which will be implemented by the World Health Organization Country’s Office, will focus on a particular emphasis on provision of personal protective equipment to health and first-line workers in healthcare facilities.
At present, almost all available personal protective equipment (PPEs) in Uzbekistan is used for the detection, triage, verification, isolation and treatment of COVID -19 patients and their contacts. That leaves a large share of healthcare workers dealing with other than suspected or confirmed COVID -19 patients unprotected, like those in maternity hospitals, TB and HIV clinics, dentists and policlinics, etc. Therefore, the procurement of WHO-recommended PPE for healthcare workers not only working with COVID-19 patients but also in other health services and facilities, is essential to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
The healthcare personnel are our everyday heroes and we must make sure that they can work safely when protecting us. This project is a key part of the 36 Million Euro Team Europe response to the pandemic in Uzbekistan, - said Jussi Narvi, Chargé d'affaires of the European Union to Uzbekistan.
The procurement of enough quality personnel protection equipment is essential to be distributed to all healthcare workers in the country to avoid more losses of healthcare personnel due to illness and to reduce the cases of COVID 19 patients among the population, - said Dr. Lianne Kuppens, Head of the WHO Country Office in Uzbekistan.
With the financial support of the European Union and in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan, the project will strengthen infection prevention and control measures through procurement of sufficient and high-quality PPEs for all healthcare workers in the country for the next two years.

Title: The Main Expert and Criminalistics Centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan received accreditation for compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 international standard
Content: 23 September 2020
Today the Main Expert and Criminalistics Centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan officially received the accreditation certificate for compliance with ISO/IEC 17025 for testing and calibration laboratories. Mr. Oybek Kulbekov, Deputy Chief of Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Mr. Saidolim Nuriddinov, Head of the Main Expert, and Criminalistics Centre and Ms. Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia attended the ceremony. Mr. Russel Singer, Director of the INL Programmes in Uzbekistan joined the event through online video conference platform.
“The quality of the analyses and the results of the work performed by forensic laboratories are crucial for the justice system, law enforcement in general, and crime prevention and health policy. Comparability and acceptability of laboratory results from different countries is ensured by adherence to the international quality assurance standard for testing and calibration laboratories”, Ms. Mittal remarked.
The drug-testing laboratory of the Main Expert and Criminalistics Centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has successfully passed an independent evaluation and was found compliant with the relevant requirements of the international standard ISO/IEC 17025 "General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories".
The accreditation certificate was issued in June of this year by the Kazakhstan National Center of Accreditation, which is a full member of the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and a signatory of the ILAC Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA), as well as the Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC) and a signatory of the APLAC MRA on the accreditation of testing and calibration laboratories (ISO/IEC 17025).
"This international [accreditation] certificate testifies that the forensic activities of the Main Expert and Criminalistics Centre of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are well-organized in line with the international standards. It will serve to further enhancement of international cooperation of the Internal Affairs bodies in combatting and preventing crime, protecting human rights and freedoms, as well as contribute to further confidence of the population and foreign organizations in the law enforcement agencies of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the future. Furthermore, these will enable ensuring the use of the internationally recognized scientific and technical approaches and methods in the research process; minimizing the human factor in applying the scientific and technical methods used in the research; increasing the international prestige of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the fight against trans-border drug trafficking crimes; as well as acceptance of the results of drug examinations internationally,” said Mr. Saidolim Nuriddinov, Head of the Main Expert and Criminalistics Centre.
The successful accreditation was the result of a three-year-long collaboration between the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Main Expert and Criminalistics Centre within Sub-programme 4 "Research and Trend Analysis" of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia for 2015-2020. UNODC supports laboratories in the introduction and implementation of a Quality Management System (QMS) through initiatives such as the provision of reference samples of controlled substances, guidelines for laboratories on recommended analysis methods, training opportunities and participation in the International Collaborative Exercises programme, and by promoting and facilitating the exchange of information, materials and data.

Title: Discussion of Uzbekistan’s digital potential in view of the pandemic outbreak
Content: 18 September 2020
‘Unlocking the Potential of Digitalization in Uzbekistan Amidst a Global Health and Socio-Economic Crisis’ international round-table was hosted by UNDP, in partnership with the World Bank, the Digital Development Partnership, and MiTC. Bringing together specialists and experts of national and international digital industries, the online event laid a groundwork for the continued development of Uzbekistan’s digital sector for the public’s benefit.
Although the positive impacts of Uzbekistan’s digital transformation have been apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are also multiple directions for improvement. Internet access is uneven across Uzbekistan, while the digital economy contributes just 1.8% to the national GDP. 70% of 700 government information systems are not integrated with the e-government platform, and only 27 agencies provide services through the national public service delivery framework.
This week’s round-table was an opportunity to reflect on the benefits and challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought in terms of Uzbekistan’s digitalization process, and to determine the ways that society, government and business can use digital technologies to address challenges faced during the pandemic and beyond.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous damage to the entire global economy and has identified critical vulnerabilities, the harm from which can only be minimized by expanding the scope of digital technologies in all spheres of life."- said the First Deputy Minister, Oleg Pekos.
The discussion took stock of Uzbekistan’s achievements in digital development since 2017, overviewed digital technology’s role in the national COVID-19 response (compared to its use in the UK, Estonia and Singapore), and explored opportunities for expanding Uzbekistan’s ambitious digital transformation with consideration of what accelerators and assistance might be mobilized in this direction.
Two thematic sessions were conducted at the event, on the topics of ‘Digital development in Uzbekistan: current progress and way forward’, and ‘Digital response to COVID-19: lessons from Uzbekistan and abroad’, both of which resulting in an active exchange of views. Following this event an analytical report will be delivered, containing recommendations for expanding Uzbekistan’s digital transformation, along with an agreement on a mechanism to ensure dialogue between relevant parties and agencies, to discuss issues related to digital transformation.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical nature of the telecommunications infrastructure for Uzbekistan’s economy and has highlighted further the urgency of undertaking reforms in the sector. Their implementation will facilitate the acceleration of digitalization in various areas, help in ensuring citizens' critical access to education, telemedicine, and employment. In addition, digitalization helps preserve business continuity, attract significant private investment for an open, competitive, and private sector-led telecommunication services markets. These measures will benefit citizens and businesses across the country. The World Bank Group stands ready to provide the necessary support to the Government in planning and implementing the necessary reforms, as well as attracting investments in the sector,” noted Marco Mantovanelli, World Bank Country Manager for Uzbekistan.
Event participants included government bodies for the planning, oversight and implementation of digital development, public service delivery and COVID-19 response, individual experts and subject matter specialists, business representatives, members of the mass media and prominent bloggers, participants in the private sector, and youth and youth organizations.
Also, in attendance were representatives of Uzbekistan’s international community, including those of the UN Country Team, international finance institutions, selected embassies, development agencies and others, along with think-tanks, NGOs and firms specializing in digital governance.
“With the pandemic, digitalization for any country has become mandatory, not optional. Digital solutions were critical to ensure effective service delivery and remote interaction of citizens and businesses with government under quarantine. To maintain business continuity, public and private sector have increasingly turned to digital tools and channels. That happened in almost all sectors! So, the question is not if digitalization shall and will advance, it is about the quality of it – and how inclusive it will be”- said in the conclusion UNDP Resident Representative, Ms Matilda Dimovska.

Title: WHO mission praises Uzbekistan’s whole-of-government COVID-19 response
Content: 15 September 2020
WHO and the Robert Koch Institute led a joint mission to Uzbekistan on 22-28 August to assess COVID-19 risks and to understand the situation on the ground.
The mission sought to understand the response mechanisms by visiting designated hospitals in urban and rural areas, national and peripheral laboratories and other response structures, such as primary health care centers and public health departments in Tashkent, Samarkand and Bukhara. Mission experts noted the high-level of commitment throughout government, facilitating cooperation across sectors and laying the groundwork for comprehensive legislation, including a National Strategic Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19,
Experts commended officials for moving quickly to respond to the outbreak. Efforts to improve testing capacity, isolation measures, treatment and contact tracing were included in a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach. The country was further praised for setting up designated COVID-19 triage and treatment centres and organizing hospital structures and administrative systems to deal optimally with cases.
“Low-hanging fruits”
It was noted that Uzbekistan benefits from a high level of community awareness, as well as a working surveillance system providing daily aggregated data to inform decision-making. Additionally, the number of national diagnostic laboratories increased in response to the outbreak, creating a network of 60 throughout the country.
Experts advised establishing a platform for knowledge sharing via video conferencing. They also recommended scaling up national training programs for laboratory staff and expanding Quality Management Systems, in cooperation with international partners.

Title: UNDP empowers women scientists in Uzbekistan
Content: 07 September 2020
From June 1 to September 1, 2020, the UN Development Programme and the Ministry of Innovative Development of the Republic of Uzbekistan, with the support of the Swedish Embassy, ​​ conducted trainings to raise the quality of research and academic publishing activities of women scientists in Uzbekistan.
Uzbekistan has set an ambitious goal of entering the top 50 countries in the Global Innovation Index rating, which, among many other indicators, takes into account the number and citation of published articles in the country. According to the Scopus database of scientists (an international organization that evaluates the activities of scientists around the world), among the top 20 women scientists for the period 2015-2020, there were only 3 representatives from Uzbekistan in the top 20 scientists for the period 2015-2020, indicating the need greater involvement of women in scientific research.
51 participants were ultimately selected from more than 250 applications. Training sessions and seminars were conducted by the leading economist Rauf Salakhodjaev, a three-time winner of Scopus’ award for achievements in science.
During the trainings, participants were exposed to effective strategies for writing scientific articles and literature reviews, negotiating the complex landscape of social science methodologies,  conducting empirical analysis and much more. Following this, the articles of 3 participants were accepted in the International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy, Tourism Review International, and the International Journal of development studies- all leading journals in their fields.

Title: UNDP-UNFPA Joint Programme responds to COVID-19 pandemic in Karakalpakstan
Content: 31 August 2020
Since 2005, the Joint Programme of UNDP and the UN Fund  “Building the resilience of local communities against health, environmental and economic insecurities caused by environmental destruction in the Aral Sea region”, funded by the Japanese government, actively cooperates with the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan in the prevention of various diseases. In 2020, a new topic was added to the agenda "Response measures to combat COVID-19 in Karakalpakstan."
In June, 85,000 information booklets, posters on the prevention of coronavirus in the Karakalpak and Russian languages, as well as in Braille were transferred to the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Karakalpakstan, which was an important source of information during the strict quarantine and limited access to Internet connection in remote regions. Along with the informational material, we also delivered 20,000 medical masks. Today we handed over 6 types of information materials in the amount of 30,000 booklets and posters in the Uzbek and Karakalpak languages, with the aim of reaching the population of the southern regions of Karakalpakstan (Amu Darya, Beruni, Turtkul and Ellikala), as well as for preventive work in medical institutions.
With the support of the Joint Programme for the Aral Sea region, medical supplies and special equipment were purchased and transferred to protect health workers and community volunteers in 10 target areas from contracting coronavirus infection during work, that included: medical protective overalls - 1,200 pieces, safety glasses - 300 pieces, antiseptics -100 pieces, non-contact thermometer - 50 pieces and 570 pulse oximeters.
Given the new challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, volunteers who received knowledge from UN Volunteers help residents in regions with a complex environmental situation in Karakalpakstan to resist coronavirus and other diseases by informing about precautions and rules of respiratory hygiene, as well as providing online consultations through the Telegram channel. As of June 2020, volunteers have successfully held 2,136 information sessions on the prevention of various diseases, covering 1,646 households in 11 target districts of Karakalpakstan. Of these, 1317 information sessions were held online on the prevention of COVID-19.
As part of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak, over 500 volunteers were trained online using telegram group‘Volunteers of Karakalpakstan’. In addition, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan conducted online trainings for nurses, most of whom are also volunteers. In this way, we help to ensure the safety of the region by informing important respiratory hygiene practices.

Title: UN agencies will support those worst affected by the COVID-19 in Uzbekistan through a new programme
Content: 13 August 2020
While COVID-19 restrictions on trade and travel have affected everyone, vulnerable groups have been worst hit by the crisis. Youth and women who are unemployed or employed informally are struggling without direct income and social protection. Labour migrants and members of their families are experiencing disruptions to their livelihoods. The burden of care work by women and girls has vastly increased. Gender based violence and violence against children have surged. Families repatriated from armed conflict zones and children leaving specialized correctional institutions are experiencing increased psycho-social stress.
Although the Government of Uzbekistan have been quick to undertake comprehensive anti-crisis measures by introducing financial and regulatory interventions across the country, gaps remain in the scale and effectiveness of coverage of support for the most vulnerable, who include children, people with disabilities, women, the elderly and migrant labourers and their families.
To respond to these urgent needs, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) will lead a joint programme. Participating UN agencies will include United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and International Organization for Migration (IOM).  National partners include the Gender Equality Commission under the Senate, and the Ministries of Economic Development and Poverty Reduction, Mahalla and Family Support, Finance, Labour, Public Education, and Interior, as well as civil society organizations.
Young people will be actively consulted throughout the programme on legal, business and psychological matters. A wide use of digital technologies within Joint Programme will be aiming to facilitate the process of legalizing informal labor relations by improving access of informal workers to social insurance instruments, monitoring payments, assessing the effectiveness and coverage of social protection, and flexible response to changes in situation on labor markets for the most vulnerable.
The Joint Programme will offer:
The Joint Programme will complement UNICEF, UNDP and ILO’s ongoing engagement in the UN Joint Programme on Social Protection, launched last November, which aims to accelerate evidence-based transformation of the social protection system for the benefit of the most vulnerable in Uzbekistan.
This Joint Programme is funded by a grant from the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, which is a mechanism established by the UN Secretary-General to help support low- and middle income countries to respond to the pandemic and its impacts, including an unprecedented socio-economic shock. The Fund’s assistance targets those most vulnerable to economic hardship and social disruption.
Helena Fraser, UN Resident Coordinator said, “The COVID-19 outbreak is causing an increase in unemployment and poverty levels, and a spike in reports of domestic violence. New population groups are becoming vulnerable in the face of this unprecedented disruption, and there is a need for better understanding of the actual urgent needs of these groups to be able to address them timely and effectively. The UN Country Team is committed to working with our national partners in ‘development emergency‘ mode to ensure that the needs of most acutely ‘at risk’ groups are met at this unprecedented time”.
Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative said: “Uzbekistan continues to demonstrate a proactive and holistic approach to mitigate the negative impact on country’s economy of the COVID-19 and global crisis. It includes adopting anti-crisis packages to combat the spread of coronavirus infection, support of entrepreneurship, employment and social protection for the population. We need to see a resilient private sector which is better guarded against future shocks. Accordingly, the Joint Programme foresees a number of transformations in the private sector to assist national partners achieve that goal. These include a more inclusive private sector with particular emphasis on vulnerable groups; local communities and diversified business activities with strengthened local value and supply chains ".
Meanwhile, Mr. Sascha Graumann, UNICEF Representative said that “UN Country Team thank again the Government of Uzbekistan for its decisive action to reintegrate the repatriated children from Syria and Iraq into their families amidst challenging conditions”. He also commended the efforts of the Government to continue returning children from specialized correctional institutions into their communities in line with the 2019 Presidential Resolution on Restructuring Closed Facilities despite of pandemic. Mr. Graumann emphasized that “within this Joint Programme, UNICEF is committed to continue enhancing the skills and knowledge of family specialists, social workers and psychologists on case management approach to determine the needs of these vulnerable families and children in the period of COVID 19 followed by regular counselling and referral to existing social and legal services”.
Yu Yu, UNFPA Representative in Uzbekistan highlighted:
“Disease outbreaks affect women and men differently. COVID-19 is worsening existing inequalities for women and girls, and deepening discrimination against other marginalized groups.  Gendered response plans are necessary to respond to women and girls’ unique needs during this time. UNFPA is integrating prevention of violence into COVID-19 response plans and supporting shelters, online services, extending the reach of hotlines, establishing innovative awareness raising channels (like dedicated “No to violence” telegram channel) aimed at prevention of gender-based violence. UNFPA promotes justice even during the COVID-19 crisis”.
Sanjarbek Toshbaev, IOM Country Manager for Uzbekistan highlighted:
“Thousands of migrants are stranded due to travel restrictions. Remittance flows – the lifeblood of several regional economies – has slowed to a trickle. Hundreds of thousands of jobs also have been lost abroad and millions of families are in danger of extreme poverty. The Joint Programme, amongst others, aims to address the immediate socio-economic needs of the most vulnerable returning migrants and migrants’ family members, by providing them reintegration support, as well as socio-economic, psychological and legal counselling. In doing so, we will partner with government agencies and NGOs in Uzbekistan”.
List of donors to the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund includes the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Multi-Partner Trust Fund, Government of Japan and Canada Fund for Local Initiatives.

Title: Providing electricity to remote areas of Karakalpakstan
Content: 07 August 2020
Constant electricity is required for all aspects of our daily lives, including both conveniences and necessities, meaning a lack of access can greatly diminish people’s well-being, livelihoods and opportunities.
Outages in power supply have been causing inconveniences to the lives of citizens in remote communities of Karakalpakstan, where UNDP/UNPFA Joint Programme on ‘Building the Resilience of Local Communities Against Health, Environmental and Economic Insecurities in the Aral Sea Region’ has started its activities aimed to assist in resolving those problems.
Within the framework of the joint UNDP and UNFPA programme, implemented with funding from the Japanese government, distance workshops have been held to identify problems regarding access to social-infrastructure in pilot district of Karakalpakstan. After discussions with representatives from targeted communities in the Bozatau, Chimbay and Karauzyak districts, it was determined that one prominent concern was inconsistent access to a stable electricity supply.
Particularly in Sarancha and Kalenaul communities of Bozatau district, Halmurat Tope and Tak-Jap communities of Chimbay district, and Akpolat, Karamovin and Turkmaul communities of Karauzyak district, outdated transformers and a growing number of residents meant there was not enough available energy to meet communities’ demand.
In response to the identified deficiencies in energy access, the Joint Programme has delivered seven sets of electric transformer equipment, each with a 250-kilowatt capacity, to the three districts. District departments of the power supply institution took responsibility for installing the transformers, connecting them to the power network, and constructing protective gates around them. 2,500 rural residents are set to benefit from these activities.
In the near future the Joint Programme will also assist in ensuring access to clean drinking water in the Chimbay district, and will improve education infrastructure in the Bozatau district by reconstructing the premises of a branch of a secondary school.

Title: National dialogue on human rights protection in the context of restrictions introduced due to COVID-19
Content: 14 July 2020
The National Human Rights Center, jointly with the United Nations Country Team in Uzbekistan and the OSCE Project Co-Ordinator’s Office in Uzbekistan, convened a National Dialogue on human rights protection in the context of restrictions introduced due to COVID-19.
The dialogue followed the visit by a delegation of UN and OSCE officials to the quarantine center in Urtasaray on 24 June, organized by the Deputy Prime Minister Aziz Abdukhakimov and the First Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Director of the National Human Rights Center, Professor Akmal Saidov.
During the National Dialogue, speakers from the General Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Justice, the Children's Ombudsman, an expert from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, the vice-chairman of the UN Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture, a specialist from the WHO Regional Office for Europe and two independent civil society representatives shared lessons learned and recommendations arising from the experience of Uzbekistan and global perspectives.
The Republic of Uzbekistan, like the entire international community, is facing the most serious challenge to humanity in modern history - the pandemic of the coronavirus COVID-19. Thanks to the timely anti-epidemic measures taken by the Government of Uzbekistan, the country is working intensively to minimize the effects of the pandemic.
In order to counter the spread of the coronavirus infection, the President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev adopted the Order on the creation of a Special Republican Commission to prepare a program of measures to prevent the import and spread of a new type of coronavirus in the country. Subsequently, decisions were made to suspend air, rail and road communications with other states, and to close pre-school, secondary and higher educational institutions. A progressive package of economic measures has been adopted to mitigate the impact of the crisis on relatively vulnerable sectors of the economy. An Anti-Crisis Fund under the Ministry of Finance has been created with an initial amount of 10 trillion soums ($1 billion). Business and entrepreneurship entities were granted tax holidays, a number of other tax benefits and deferred loan payments. Social assistance was organized for the most vulnerable groups of the population.
To effectively combat coronavirus in all regions of the republic, specialized medical institutions and quarantine zones have been organized. In the Tashkent region, a specialized quarantine zone for 20 thousand places was commissioned, 10 thousand of which have already been put into operation. The construction of a modern modular clinic with 10 thousand beds has been completed.
At the same time, comprehensive stimulation and provision of social protection for medical workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against coronavirus and are the first to take the blow, have been strengthened.
In order to ensure clear public communications help prevent the spread of the disease, a wide-ranging information campaign is ongoing among the population, including using social networks. Measures are being taken to return citizens of Uzbekistan who are abroad.
During the meeting, participants discussed the latest UN quarantine guidelines, including: “WHO Guidelines for Quarantining Individuals in the Context of Containing Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)” dated March 19, 2020, which stipulates that “constructive interaction with the public is important [...], and Quarantined persons should receive medical assistance, financial, social and psychosocial support; their basic needs, including the need for food, water and other vital products, must be met. Priority should be given to the needs of vulnerable populations.” The WHO Guidelines also recommend that “quarantined individuals should be able to communicate with the outside world and, if possible, should be provided with access to the Internet, news resources and entertainment programs.”
In addition, participants took note of the recommendation of the UN Human Rights Committee on the derogation of rights related to COVID-19 that “states [...] cannot derogate from their obligation to treat all people, including individuals [...] in prison, with humanity and respect for their human dignity.”
As the First Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Director of the National Center for Human Rights of Uzbekistan Akmal Saidov noted, “the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights welcomed the fact that a number of governments and international organizations are taking important steps to mitigate the impact of the fight against the COVID- 19 on human rights, especially economic and social rights. In this regard, it is worth noting that in our country all the necessary measures are being taken to eliminate this threat. Most importantly, this is primarily due to the requirement that human interests take precedence over everything else.”
“I highly appreciate the active efforts of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantine zones clearly played an important role among various public health measures, as we can see from the fact that over the past month a significant majority of all new cases have been detected in these zones. International community can certainly learn from this experience.” stated Ambassador John MacGregor, OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan. “I also welcome today's open dialogue on how human rights-based zone management can be further strengthened to fulfill the OSCE commitments, relevant international legal commitments and best practices. We look forward to working with the government to implement some of the recommendations made today.”
“This event provided a useful opportunity to reflect on the importance of aligning public health measures with international health rules and human rights standards and obligations,” said Helena Fraser, UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan. “It also allowed an exchange of views between the government, international organizations and a separate group of civil society representatives on measures to strengthen the protection of the rights of persons in quarantine institutions, such as ensuring the establishment of an independent feedback and complaints mechanism so that persons in quarantine institutions can promptly communicate about their health, mental and physical well-being and thus receive timely support. We heard about the willingness of civil society volunteers to carry out coordination functions between the administrations of quarantine institutions and the persons placed in them. Constructive engagement of the Government with volunteers is a great way to ensure that the SDG principles for an accountable, participatory and consultative decision-making process are ensured with respect to quarantine facilities. I welcome the willingness of the government to share positive lessons that can be learned from the experience of quarantine institutions, as well as its openness to identify issues for further improvement. Transparency is paramount and can save lives in times of health crisis.”

Title: Cross border initiative to support Afghan women’s education in Uzbekistan
Content: 10 July 2020
The project aims to provide educational opportunities for Afghan women, who face disproportionate barriers to education and employment compared to their men counterparts back home.
Overall, 50 young women from Afghanistan will study and graduate from universities in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
The European Union (EU) provided a €2 million grant for the initiative, which will be implemented by UNDP until 2025.
“Women are key contributors to the growth of their national economies. Yet they often face social barriers when it comes to equal access to education, decent work and equal pay. With better qualifications, women are expected to gain higher-profile private or public sector jobs that will allow them to contribute productively to the development of their country”, - says H.E. Eduards Stiprais, Ambassador of the European Union to the Republic of Uzbekistan.
Afghan women will study Agriculture in Uzbekistan and after graduation will receive TVET Certificates. Young Afghan women will study in the Education Center for the Training of Afghan citizens in Termez district supported by the Tashkent State Agrarian University.
MoHSSE has supported the realization of the project. “Uzbekistan supports peace in the neighboring friendly Afghan soil and considers this process as an important condition for achieving sustainable development in the Central Asian region”, - says Uktam Salomov, First Deputy Minister of Higher and Secondary Special Education of Uzbekistan.
In October 2019, the first cohort of Afghan women arrived to Kazakhstan to start their educational journey in the fields of Statistics, Agriculture and Mining. This year, 20 more students will be awarded scholarships. They will study Agriculture in Uzbekistan and Mining in Kazakhstan. Before obtaining specialized education, students will have to undertake language courses.
“Gender equality and empowerment of women and girls are not only fundamental human rights but also smart national strategy for the development and prosperity of the country”,-  said Matilda Dimovska, UNDP Resident Representative in Uzbekistan in conclusion of the launch ceremony.

Title: Better health, employment and land-use in Karakalpakstan, through livestock development
Content: 16 June 2020
“It’s very pleasing to see that the push to develop our district’s livestock sector has become an ever-more ambitious project,” shared Nafisa Bayniyazova, chair of the ‘Ajiniyaz Jaylawlari’ pasture cooperative in the Muynak district. “I feel that my work is useful to people and this gives me both the strength and the motivation to generate new ideas.”
From 1995 to 2014 as processes of pasture desertification and degradation worsened in Karakalpakstan, caused by the Aral Sea’s disappearance, the considerable expansion of cattle farming has resulted in a 23% decrease in agricultural productivity.
Not only have the advanced technologies introduced through the cooperatives helped enhance agricultural output, but they have also limited the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
Livelihoods built from the ground 
The ‘Ajiniyaz Jaylawlari’ pasture cooperative is a part of the ‘Hakim Ata’ Rural Citizens’ Assembly of Muynak District. Along with nine other cooperatives across Karakalpakstan, it was formed in 2018 with support from UNDP and the Adaptation Fund.
Chaired by Nafisa Bayniyazova, the cooperative possesses more than 582 hectares of pasture area, with 595 families being supported through effective animal husbandry and agricultural management. In total 34,964 hectares of land in Karakalpakstan has been allocated to 10 pasture cooperatives, where 44,779 cattle, 61,610 sheep and goats, 3,620 horses and 164 camels are owned by 8,198 families.
These cooperatives are an unprecedented initiative carried out in northern Uzbekistan to fight draughts and desertification and to restore degraded and unproductive land. Through the cooperatives, livestock breeders have had access to high-quality feeders, while with UNDP assistance they’ve been supplied with tractors, plows, disc harrows, mowers, balers, water-saving irrigation technologies, and other equipment for feed production.
From the early days of the quarantine to now, members of Nafisa’s cooperative sowed 15 hectares of alfalfa, 12 hectares of vegetables, and 5 hectares of cereals through zero-tillage technology, which helped protect the district’s food security.
Since 2019, green crop harvesting technology has been introduced through a hydroponic plant with a 500 kg daily capacity. Hydroponics presents a means of plot cultivation without needing soil, with necessary nutrients being provided through a fluid solution. This approach regulates the conditions for plant cultivation, creating a nutrition regime for root systems, while ensuring maximum, better quality yields over a shorter time.
Hydroponics have made it possible to feed up to 167 heads of cattle a day, removing grazing pressure from an area of 300 hectares. It is noteworthy that the quantity of feed produced this way is equivalent to what can be cultivated on 75 hectares of traditionally irrigated land.
Installing hydroponics has the had an important additional benefit of keeping citizens healthy during the COVID-19 health crisis.
Protecting health and strengthening incomes during lockdown
“Hydroponic installations need to be carefully maintained, with the surfaces kept disinfected so that the feed is safe and healthy for animals. For this purpose, we have electrolysis units, through which we can produce the disinfectant sodium hypochlorite,” said Bektileu Abylov, head of the ‘Bozatau Jaylawi’ pasture cooperative of the Bozatau district.Sodium hypochlorite is a bactericidal and sterilizing agent widely used in medicine, in the food industry, and in agriculture.
” During the COVID-19 quarantine we joined district-level specialists in producing enough sodium hypochlorite to meet the local population’s needs.”
Since March 25 Nafisa and Bektileu have supplied between 75 to 80 liters of disinfectant each day to nearby kindergartens, schools, health facilities, shops, and other public spaces, as well as to residential complexes and private households.
“We have already covered 265 households, organizations and businesses of the ‘Hakim Ata’ and ‘Bozatau’ Rural Citizens’ Assemblies of the Muynak District, offering 2,100 liters of disinfectant in total,” Nafisa Bayniyazova said.“We’ve all been working hard, and we hope that soon we will be able to return to our old way of life.”
UNDP’s support, 10 additional sets of electrolysis devices will soon be supplied to Karakalpakstan’s districts.
As well as keeping people healthy, the cooperatives have also helped citizens remain employed and maintain their incomes through the quarantine. 88 people have been employed in full-time jobs by pasture cooperatives in Karakalpakstan during the quarantine period, while work to plant a 10-hectare nursery of sand crops to secure drift sands on the dry seabed of the Aral Sea has also created employment.
UNDP in Uzbekistan has worked extensively with national partners and international donors to ensure the climate sustainability of farms and dehkan farms, and to create favorable conditions for lives of residents in Karakalpakstan’s most arid regions.

Title: UNDP and Canada are joining forces to strengthen health and livelihoods during COVID-19
Content: 05 June 2020
The Government of Canada, through the Embassy of Canada’s Fund for Local Initiatives allocated today 250,000 Canadian Dollars (CAD) to enhance UNDP’s livelihood development activities in the Syrdarya region, and in the Aral Sea area of the Karakalpakstan region.
The financial support offered will help build resilience to the pandemic in rural areas of Uzbekistan, by increasing employment opportunities for women-led rural households in the Sydarya region and enhancing access to clean water and safe disinfectants in Karakalpakstan.
Combined with resources from other donors, this funding will be utilized by the Rapid Response Facility created to address COVID-19’s consequences in Uzbekistan.
Given the essential role small businesses play in Uzbekistan’s economy, and the major impact COVID-19 has had on this sector, supporting entrepreneurs has been a national priority. The funding provided by Canada will improve employment capacities and training opportunities for women-led households in Syrdarya by establishing women-led businesses including pasta production, barbershops and hair salons, sewing workshops, and a handicrafts training center.
The funding will also be used to improve clean water access for sanitation purposes, helping prevent COVID-19 infections in women-led households and schools in both Sydarya and Karakalpakstan regions. In Karakalpakstan, water will be sourced from shallow wells and collector-drainage systems, and further purified through a reverse osmosis process. The resulting brine waste product will be processed by hydrolysis equipment to make sodium hypochlorite, a safe disinfectant which is effective against COVID-19. In Syrdarya, access to clean water will be achieved by reconstructing existing wells and creating a new water distribution system.
These initiatives have been planned together with women leaders of community organizations, such as the women-led Association of Pasture Cooperatives of Karakalpakstan, while also being informed by needs-assessment studies. These national partners will play an instrumental role in helping to achieve the project outcomes, while they will also provide training and support to community residents, thereby helping ensure the project’s sustainability.
The initiative will also create at least 100 jobs for women, and train at least 1,500 unemployed women in marketable skills which will help them gain greater economic independence.
The Embassy of Canada and the UNDP have collaborated since 2015  through the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives,  contributing to efforts to empower women and most recently ,and most recently to the UNDP project ‘Developing climate resilience of farming communities in the drought prone parts of Uzbekistan’ (May 2020). UNDP will continue working in close collaboration with the Fund over coming years, to accelerate peace and development in Uzbekistan.

Title: World Refugee Day Youth Competition 2020: Post-COVID solutions for refugees
Content: 01 June 2020
The competition calls eligible young people to bring up their ideas, and thus honor the courage and strength of people who had to leave their homes and restart a new life in a new place. The main prize is a laptop.
Background information:
The outbreak of COVID-19 has shown that we all are vulnerable. It has exposed how it is important to have access to clean water and soap, accurate information, basic goods and sustainable job. The virus has impacted all societies by spreading without barriers through countries and continents. But its impact on people across the globe was not equal.  Certain vulnerable groups, including refugees, have been hit the hardest by the pandemic.
Refugees are people, who, to save their lives had no other choice but to leave the country they lived in and find a safe place somewhere else. Some refugees could travel legally, using their passports, but some refugees – did not have such opportunity and had to risk their lives to reach safety. People become refugees because they do not feel safe in the place they lived in – it might be because of war or fear that they will be hurt because of how they look, in what they believe, where they are from or social group they are part of.
Imposed lockdowns and home isolation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in additional challenges for refugees. Restrictions on movement disrupted their opportunities to work and earn income, whereas lack of legal status and/or valid identity documents limited their access to emergency help provided by governments.
Competition description:
On the occasion of the of the World Refugee Day UNHCR for Central Asia is organizing competition to encourage young people aged from 16 years old and above to share their ideas on how refugees can be supported to recover from difficult socio-economic situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The competition calls eligible young people to bring up their ideas, and thus honor the courage and strength of people who had to leave their homes and restart a new life in a new place.
Competition task:
Difficulties faced by refugees across the world are not identical, they are different from country to country, from place to place. Therefore, participants are free to select the country they have interest to research and prepare a project that aims to help refugees after COVID-19 in one of the following areas:

Title: Uzbekistan to Receive World Bank Emergency Financing to Combat COVID-19
Content: 24 April 2020
The financing will be used to strengthen life-saving medical systems, as well as to provide income support to poor and vulnerable people affected by the economic consequences of the pandemic.
“This assistance is part of a package put together by a coalition of development partners to help protect the people of Uzbekistan against the threats of COVID-19,” said Hideki Mori, World Bank Country Manager for Uzbekistan. “The Government, World Health Organization (WHO), other UN agencies, international finance institutions including the World Bank Group, bilateral aid agencies, and non-governmental organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), are all standing together to support the country during this difficult time.”
About $38 million will be used to strengthen the capacity of the national health system in areas like disease surveillance, testing, equipment, and facilities for the treatment of critically ill patients, including ventilators and Intensive Care Units. The remaining $57 million will help the Government extend the program of low-income family allowances and provide one-off unemployment benefits.
“I want to acknowledge and thank doctors, nurses, and all those who are on the frontline of Uzbekistan’s battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. They are putting their lives at risk to save the lives of others. To help them do their work, let us all continue practicing good personal hygiene, social distancing, and staying-at-home during the quarantine,” said Mr. Mori.
The World Bank Group, one of the largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries, is taking broad, fast action to help developing countries strengthen their pandemic response. We are increasing disease surveillance, improving public health interventions, and helping the private sector continue to operate and sustain jobs. Over the next 15 months, we will be deploying up to $160 billion in financial support to help countries protect the poor and vulnerable, support businesses, and bolster economic recovery, including $50 billion of new IDA resources in grants or highly concessional terms.

Content: 07 April 2020
On behalf of the international organizations, the UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan, Ms. Helena Fraser, conveyed the commitment of the entire UN Country Team and the International Financial Institutions (IFIs), namely World Bank Group, ADB and EBRD, in supporting the national response to the COVID-19 crisis. She also welcomed the strong partnership and spirit of solidarity between the Government of Uzbekistan and the multilateral organizations in tackling the COVID19 outbreak in Uzbekistan.
Ms. Fraser commended the robust national measures adopted to minimize the spread of the virus and to mitigate its socio-economic impact, including on vulnerable populations, through the Government’s Anti-Crisis Fund and the national socio-economic stabilization plan. She also welcomed the cooperation between Ministry of Health and WHO on the national Strategic Preparedness & Response Plan, which is part of the global WHO COVID-19 response plan. Ms. Fraser also commended the leadership of the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade in coordinating the Government-UN-IFI procurement task force.
Dr. Lianne Kuppens, WHO Representative, commended the forward-leaning strategy of the Government to minimize the spread of the virus by adopting robust movement and physical distancing measures, in line with WHO recommendations. She re-emphasized the importance of the comprehensive approach, each component being equally important, not only to prevent further transmission but also to contain the outbreak:
Dr. Kuppens highlighted three points for the attention of the Commission in relation to the health response, drawing on evolving global best practice:
The UNDP Representative Ms. Matilda Dimovska and World Bank Country Manager Mr. Hideki Mori welcomed the Government’s Anti-Crisis Fund and socio-economic stabilization plan. They highlighted aspects of ongoing and planned cooperation between the Government and the international organizations on socio-economic mitigation and underlined the importance of access to quality data to inform evidence-based policy-making. The World Bank also highlighted forthcoming financing.
The Government side acknowledged the UN and IFIs efforts to reorient current programmes and resources to support the national COVID19 response.
The UN Resident Coordinator outlined the crisis coordination arrangements agreed among the multilateral organizations, and highlighted the associated priority workstreams:
The Resident Coordinator also confirmed that the UN Country Team and IFIs will cooperate to share assessments, analysis, standards, and policy recommendations with the Government of Uzbekistan, in line with the UN Secretary-General’s recent report “Shared responsibility, global solidarity: Responding to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19”.
In conclusion, the Deputy Prime Minister welcomed the efforts of the UN Country Team, the IFIs and other international organizations to support the national COVID-19 response, and reconfirmed the Government’s commitment to ensuring a comprehensive approach implementing global best practice and the interest and willingness to cooperate closely in relation to ongoing response, as well as post-recovery planning and strategies.

Title: Ministry of Health and World Health Organization present first COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for Uzbekistan
Content: 20 March 2020
The Group is a forum for coordination among Government, the United Nations system, International Financial Institutions, donors and international health partners on all aspects of international assistance to the COVID-19 outbreak in Uzbekistan.
Developed in close collaboration between the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health of Uzbekistan, the SPRP is a living document, which at this point covers only top priority health-related preparedness and response efforts. Additional socio-economic preparedness and response priorities will be added in the coming days, and the health priorities will be updated to reflect evolving needs.
The plan is currently costed at 30 million USD. Key priorities include:
The SPRP is a global tool to support national health systems to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. As they are ready, all national SPRPs are being uploaded to the global online Partnership Platform for COVID-19 preparedness and response. This platform is the primary global system to match gaps in responses with possible resources, including financial resources and partnerships available at global and national level across Governments, private sector, International Organizations and civil society actors.

Title: ‘Solidarity, hope’ and coordinated global response needed to tackle COVID-19 pandemic, says UN chief
Content: 17 March 2020
Unlike any global health crisis in the 75-year history of the United Nations, the coronavirus pandemic is “spreading human suffering, infecting the global economy and upending people’s lives”, he added.
Calling for global solidarity, Mr. Guterres said: “Our human family is stressed, and the social fabric is being torn. People are suffering, sick and scared”.
And as country-level responses cannot single-handedly address the global scale and complexity of the crisis, he maintained that “coordinated, decisive and innovative policy action” is needed from the world’s leading economies.
Mr. Guterres said that he looks forward to participating in the G20 leaders’ emergency summit next week to respond to the pandemic’s “epic challenge”.
“My central message is clear”, he spelled out: “We are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.”
Indicating that “we are at war with a virus”, the UN chief stressed that creative responses “must match the unique nature of the crisis – and the magnitude of the response must match its scale.”
And although COVID-19 is killing people and attacking economies, by managing the crisis well, “we can steer the recovery toward a more sustainable and inclusive path”, he said.
“I call on world leaders to come together and offer an urgent and coordinated response to this global crisis,” he said. Full speech: https://bit.ly/2J1LPaB

Title: Uzbekistan faces crucial challenges for judicial independence, says UN human rights expert
Content: 25 September 2019
GENEVA / TASHKENT– Important steps have been taken in Uzbekistan to dismantle an authoritarian and centralist structure that has previously severely undermined the independence of justice, the function of lawyers and the rule of law, says visiting UN rights expert Diego Garcia-Sayán.
“I emphasise that this process is ongoing and that further improvements must be made. I have also perceived an openness to criticisms and I salute this approach,” said García-Sayán, the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, presenting a preliminary statement at the end of his visit.

“Substantial threats against judicial independence and the rule of law remain,” he said, referring to the heavy and constant presence of the security services throughout society and Uzbekistan’s institutions. He was also concerned about broad powers that prosecutors retain in criminal proceedings, and that limit the independence of the judge to decide the case autonomously and in accordance with his or her conscience.
“The Government must now act urgently to sustain and complete the reform process and bring to an end those practices which currently affect access to justice and threaten efforts to achieve judicial independence.”
Garcia-Sayán said he had identified a number of positive steps, including an increase in the number of acquittals in recent years, the creation of the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme School for Judges, and the gradual establishment of electronic procedures aimed to increase transparency and facilitate access to justice.
“An increase in the number of acquittals in criminal proceedings demonstrates a gradual move from a system where the autonomy of judges was limited to rubber-stamping decisions by the prosecutor,” said Garcia-Sayán.
In 2016, only six acquittals were recorded. The number rose to 263 in 2017, and to 867 in 2018. So far, in the first nine months of 2019, more than 500 individuals have been acquitted.
The system as a whole should have a clearer human rights focus, said Garcia-Sayan. “Not only should this be central in the training of judges, but a new provision should be included in the Constitution to recognise that international norms and standards take precedence, in case of a conflict, over legislative and regulatory provisions enacted by national authorities.
Following allegations of interference with lawyers’ access to accused persons held in detention facilities, Garcia-Sayán suggested that a legal provision establishing severe sanctions against any public official or person responsible for impeding that access should be considered.
In an effort to increase the number of lawyers in the country, the UN expert suggested that steps could be taken to promote or establish new law schools and to review the obligatory three months of internship to become a defense lawyer.
“Uzbekistan should also take action to strengthen and improve the participation of civil society in the justice process, for instance through participation in the Supreme Judicial Council. It would also be advisable for judges to play an active role in selecting members of their own ranks to sit on the council,” said Garcia-Sayán.
“Corruption and associated criminal structures within the State are a major threat against its institutions, including the judiciary”.
“Uzbekistan needs to institute investigative and judicial procedures to confront impunity. It should also ensure that adequate and trustworthy teams are in place in the judiciary and in the Prosecutor’s Office. Appropriate legal regulations on plea bargaining are also necessary in order to get at the truth in cases of corruption and organized crime.”
The Special Rapporteur will present a comprehensive report containing his findings and recommendations to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in June 2020.

Title: What the Global Goals Mean for Uzbekistan
Content: 30 October 2018

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. The Goals were endorsed by all UN member states, including Uzbekistan, in September 2015. They comprise 17 goals and 169 targets to be reached by 2030, which will be measured by more than 200 indicators.
“The UN commends Uzbekistan’s adoption of its national goals and targets. This step   confirms that Uzbekistan’s ongoing 5-year reform agenda is strongly aligned to the ambitious targets for 2030 agreed under the Global Goals. The resolution provides a practical impetus to accelerate ongoing transformations across all five pillars of the Action Strategy, and to ensure their sustainability over the longer-term” said Helena Fraser, UN Resident Coordinator in Uzbekistan.
“I firmly believe that this is an important step in promoting prosperity and dignity for all in Uzbekistan.”
The signed document sets 16 national sustainable development goals and 127 related targets for 2030. It also envisages preparation of regular national reports on implementation of SDGs in Uzbekistan, as well as gradual integration of sustainable development goals into the state development programmes and budgets of Uzbekistan. Oversight of the national SDGs will rest with Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of Finance, Mr. J. Kuchkarov.
The national SDGs envisage a set of concrete goals and targets in the economic, social, and environment dimensions. For example, in the economic and livelihoods area, they envisage a significant decrease in poverty rates in Uzbekistan, a significant increase in per capita GDP, and significant reduction in youth unemployment rates by 2030.
In social area, some important targets include decreasing maternal mortality rate by 1/3, child mortality - by half, as well as a 30% decrease of deaths from non-communicable diseases (such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases) by 2030. In addition, there is a target to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all.
In energy and environment areas, the resolution confirms the commitment to increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the country’s energy mix by 2030, and substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.
To provide a solid foundation for the reforms in the above areas, they must be underpinned by a sound governance and human rights system, which the national SDGs also cover. For example, in the governance and rule of law areas, national targets aim at reducing corruption, increasing efficiency, transparency and accountability of state bodies at all levels, as well as increasing citizen participation in decision-making.
“The United Nations in Uzbekistan, together with United Nations entities operating at global and regional levels, is committed to support the Government of Uzbekistan in implementing the provisions of the resolution on SDGs.  In signing the Resolution, the Government of Uzbekistan has re-confirmed its strong commitment to collaborate on advancing human development in line with the principle of leaving no one behind. This means that the specific needs and aspirations of everyone — including the most vulnerable people —will be addressed as the country takes decisive steps to build a more prosperous, resilient and sustainable society by 2030.” Helena Fraser noted.
