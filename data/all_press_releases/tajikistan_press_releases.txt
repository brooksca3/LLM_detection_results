UN agencies in Tajikistan, state entities, donor community and civil society supported the event dedicated to the Candlelight Memorial Day that is marked globally third Sunday of May every year to remember the many lives lost to AIDS.
Participants paid tribute to those who lost their lives to AIDS, discussed the situation with AIDS in the country and in the world and mentioned the importance of giving hope to those living with HIV.
During the event, representatives of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Tajikistan, United Nations, USAID and public organization Spin Plus provided opening remarks followed by the stories of people who live with HIV.

UN Resident Coordinator a.i. Mr. Lenni Montiel highlighted the importance of supporting people living with HIV and added: “Despite significant progress in medicine and healthcare that help those living with HIV, challenges such as gender inequalities, stigma and discrimination continue to hinder the fight against AIDS. Hence, Candlelight memorial is not only about cherishing the memories of those who lost their lives due to AIDS, but also about recommitting further support of HIV/AIDS related programmes to save lives”.
The event facilitated enhanced awareness, supported raising social consciousness about HIV/AIDS, and offered a platform for solidarity, breaking down barriers of stigma and discrimination with increased individual and coordinated actions against the epidemic.

30 April 2024
Tajikistan takes significant strides towards bolstering its preapredness and resilience against disasters impact through a series of local level workshops/consultations under the Early Warnings for All (EW4ALL) initiative.
Tajikistan emerged as one of the first thirty countries to roll out the Secretary General’s EW4ALL initiative, which was launched globally at COP27 in 2022, and nationally in Tajikistan in August 2023 co-Chaired by Mr. Sulaymon Ziyozoda, the Deputy Prime-Minister of Tajikistan and Ms. Parvathy Ramaswami the UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan.
The local consultations held during 19-30 April in Khujand, Khorog and Bokhtar aimed to discuss a draft EW4All Roadmap prepared by all involved, including government institutions, UN, international partners, EW4All Pillar Leads and to ensure localization and effective implementation of this initiative.   The workshops underscored the urgency of bridging the gap in early warning coverage in regions of the country that are vulnerable to avalanches, earthquakes, floods, mudflows, and landslides and brought together key stakeholders, including local and national level government representatives, UN agencies and international partners.
UN Resident Coordinator Ms. Parvathy Ramaswami, who is co-leading this initiative jointly with the Deputy Prime-Minister of Tajikistan highlighted the importance of local level consultations and mentioned: “These consultations truly embrace localization, engaging with diverse stakeholders at sub-national level. It is a very timely opportunity to hear their voices and suggestions on mitigating the adverse consequences of climate change, on adapting actions to be better prepared, and responding effectively when needed. Early warning systems become effective when it is in practice at the local level and is sustainable when all sectors and levels of administration work together."
Moving forward, the insights gathered from these workshops will inform the finalization and approval of a comprehensive Roadmap to be endorsed during first half of 2024 at a national event. This collaborative approach, involving government agencies, development partners, civil society, and the private sector, reflects Tajikistan’s commitment to building resilient communities and contributing to global efforts in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and addressing climate change challenges.

Background:
The Early Warnings for All Initiative calls for a global effort to ensure that such systems protect everyone on Earth by 2027. Early Warning Systems, supported by preparedness and early action, are a proven, effective, and feasible disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measure, that save lives and provide a tenfold return on investment. Yet, major gaps in early warning systems remain globally, especially when it comes to translating early warnings into risk-informed early action.

Women's breakfast in Tajikistan: My health, my right.
To empower women in Tajikistan to overcome the barriers to live a healthy lifestyle posed by gender inequalities, the WHO Country Office in Tajikistan organized an intimate event about the health and well-being of working women. A group of resilient women came together for an informal breakfast.
Gender inequality and discrimination hit women's health hard in Tajikistan. And this indivertibly affects their health and well-being. Many women in Tajikistan do not have sufficient decision-making power when it comes to their own health, and healthcare. Furthermore, a lack of access to quality, basic maternal healthcare, and to quality information and awareness restrict many young girls and women to enjoy adequate prenatal care sometimes leading to higher rates of maternal complications and even death during childbirth.
Thirty women from different ages and walks of life came together to share information, exchange ideas and experiences and to foster an open dialogue on issues which directly impact their health and well-being on a daily basis. They discussed how to balance their work- and personal life, how to ensure sufficient physical activity and good nutrition, and what one can do to take good care of their mental health.
“We should have these type of events more often. To discuss about our health and well-being, and to empower each other to improve our situation as women in Tajikistan” – Participant of the women’s breakfast in Tajikistan.
By nurturing a supportive community and sparking conversations that resonate on both professional and personal levels, this initiative aimed to support women to live a healthier lifestyle and to support their families and communities to do the same.
WHO promotes gender equality and to improve women’s health, overcoming barriers rooted in sociocultural factors. This includes ensuring women and girls have access to quality health services, education and information; and are protected from physical, sexual and economic violence.

Title: UN Women and French Embassy Collaborate to Strengthen Shelters for Survivors of Gender-Based Violence in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 April 2024
On March 29, 2024, UN Women and the French Embassy in Tajikistan partnered to host an event focusing on protecting survivors of gender-based violence through shelters. The event aimed to raise awareness among governmental authorities, the private sector, development partners, and key stakeholders about the activities and achievements of shelters in Tajikistan.
The event brought together more than 60 participants and featured a panel discussion with directors of four shelters, highlighting challenges, best practices, and lessons learned. Key challenges included insufficient financial resources, a lack of experienced and gender-sensitive psychologists, and ensuring the safety and security of shelter personnel.
The event aimed to foster partnerships between shelters and organizations to contribute to creating a comprehensive and effective response to gender-based violence. By bringing together diverse expertise, resources, and perspectives, these partnerships can significantly amplify efforts to raise awareness, provide support, and prevent further violence.
In her opening remarks, Ms. Parvathy Ramaswami, UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, highlighted that “This event is yet another opportunity to reaffirm our collective partnership and collaboration to protect and support survivors and to eliminate the scourge of gender-based violence that prevents our community, society and the nation from achieving gender equality and empowerment."
During her opening remarks, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the Republic of Tajikistan, Mrs. Elsa Pignol stated “Like Tajikistan, like all the countries in the world, France has been facing this problem for centuries but took legal and concrete measures quite recently. The eradication of domestic violence is a long and complex process which needs to be conducted jointly on legal, educational and practical grounds.  It requires constant monitoring: no country, including mine, can claim to have overcome this problem forever. No country has lessons to give.”
In his opening remarks, Mr. Peter Riley, USAID Mission Director in Tajikistan, emphasized that ‘’Protecting women and girls is not only a matter of human rights, justice, and fairness, but also a strategic imperative that has wide-ranging positive impacts on society. He stressed that gender-based violence is not solely a women's issue, but a human rights concern that demands urgent attention and concerted action from all segments of society”.
The event also sought to identify strategies for further advancements in this crucial area. UN Women's "Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Prevention and Response in Tajikistan" project, supported by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) of the US Department of State, is dedicated to enhancing services for GBV victims, including through shelters.
Ms. Madina Nizomova, the director of Public Organization "Ghamkhori" in Bokhtar, emphasized the crucial role of NGOs in introducing activities to address the aggression and stereotypes prevalent in the community towards vulnerable groups. She also shared statistics indicating that 2,351 individuals sought support from the organization, with 91 women and 118 children finding placement in the shelter from January 2020 to December 2023.
Public Organization "Korvoni umed," provided shelter/temporary residence to 22 women, 6 teenagers, and 32 children in 2023. Since the beginning of the project, they have supported 296 women, 63 teenagers, and 281 children. Ms. Umeda Sadritdinova, the director of the organization, stressed the importance of prioritizing the safety of shelter employees and those at risk, particularly individuals with HIV/AIDS or TB.
Ms. Gulrukhsor Abdullaeva, Director of the Public Organization "Gulrukhsor", emphasized the enormous impact of kindness and care, noting that even a small gesture can significantly improve a person's life. In 2023, the organization received 2,401 calls to the helpline and night consultations, and 112 women with children were placed in shelters.
UN Women has worked in Tajikistan since 1999 to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment. Aligned with the country’s national development priorities, UN Women supports Tajikistan’s efforts to implement its gender equality commitments by focusing on women empowerment, ending violence against women and peace and security and engendering humanitarian action.

Title: CASH FOR WORK: USAID SUPPORTS WFP’S RESPONSE TO RISING FOOD INSECURITY IN TAJIKISTAN
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
12 March 2024
Dushanbe, Tajikistan, March 12, 2024 – The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has generously contributed US$7 million to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to bolster assistance for vulnerable households facing rising food insecurity in Tajikistan.
The funding will enable WFP to support vulnerable communities to better meet their food needs and strengthen the government’s capacity to address the impacts of ongoing price hikes. Over the next two years, this initiative will benefit around 15,000 households by transferring cash in exchange for work in building productive and protective assets. These assets will further enhance the resilience of more than 24,000 households, supporting a total of 120,000 people.
“We are proud to partner with the World Food Programme to support vulnerable households that are at risk of falling deeper into poverty as a result of the global price shocks for food and fertilizer felt after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” stated Manuel Micaller, U.S. Ambassador.
“We thank the U.S. Government for its commitment to fighting food insecurity in Tajikistan. As communities continue to be affected by ongoing global crises and high food prices, this contribution will help to address the most food-insecure people’s immediate food needs with cash, while improving their long-term food security and resilience. We are working directly with smallholder farmers, especially those led by women and youth on the ground to enable them to maintain their livelihoods,” said Adham Musallam, WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan.
According to 2023 FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) to the Republic of Tajikistan, about 1.56 million people were facing acute food insecurity, nearly 50,000 of whom were severely food insecure. However, there has been an improvement from last year, with a reduction in those acutely food insecure from 20 percent to 16 percent, showing stabilization since early 2023. WFP is closely monitoring the household-level food security and market situation, as well as mobilizing funds to support food-insecure families in the country.

Title: Health systems marathon: to accelerate reforms in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 February 2024
25 February 2024, Dushanbe – With support from the European Union and the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe), a ‘marathon’ of high-level events was organized in February. Each event facilitated a deep dive into key components of the Tajik health system. The outcomes of the health systems marathon bring the country closer to ensuring quality health care is accessible and affordable for the entire population. The events were organized as part of the Health Development Programme, financed by the European Union.
Tajikistan is currently implementing ambitious health reforms to make progress towards universal health coverage (UHC): access to quality health care for all, without causing financial hardship. To this end, the country is working to improve the quality and affordability of health services and to ensure skilled health workers are available where they are needed most. With funding provided by the European Union, WHO/Europe provides significant, ongoing support to strengthen each component of the health system.
The marathon commenced on 20 February, with the Joint Annual Review, organized by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population. The Government of Tajikistan and development partners jointly assessed achievements and lessons learnt over the year 2023.
H.E. Raimundas Karoblis, the EU Ambassador to Tajikistan underlined: “We reiterate the principle that every human being has the right to enjoy the highest standard of health. There is an absolute need to boost the health system in the country and to make it work better and better. As European Union, we are committed, in Tajikistan, and across the globe, to allocate at least 20% of our 2021-2027 financial allocation to Human Development, including health for all.”
During the event, Dr Natasha Azzopardi-Muscat, Director of the Division of Country Health Policies and Systems of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, highlighted the need to build a more resilient health system. She handed over an important report on the health workforce to Minister of Health and Social Protection, Dr. Jamoliddin Abdullozoda. This first analysis of its kind in Tajikistan, which presents findings and recommendations which key to further strengthen and support health workers across the country.
“The Joint Annual Review demonstrated the great progress made on the implementation of the strategy on healthcare of the population up to 2030. With support from development partners, we will continue to strengthen our health system and to bring new innovations and technologies to our beautiful country.” Dr. Jamoliddin Abdullozoda, Minister of Health and Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan.
During high-level policy dialogues on 21 and 22 February, representatives from various government institutions and development organizations discussed the key findings of an analysis of the accessibility of medicines and exchanged views on how to overcome access barriers, such as high prices or stock-outs. They also discussed ways to protect people from high out-of-pocket payments for health care. New analyses carried out by WHO/Europe indicates that nearly one in five households in Tajikistan face catastrophic health spending due to out-of-pocket payments, which may make it difficult for them to meet their other basic needs, such as food, housing and heating. Tajikistan is currently rethinking health financing policy so that it can reduce the health system’s reliance on out-of-pocket payments and improve affordable access to comprehensive primary care services, including prescribed medicines and diagnostic tests, for the whole population.
“Tajikistan is implementing key reforms which will benefit the health and well-being of the whole population. WHO works closely with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population and many other partners to strengthen the entire health system. We are proud of our joint achievements in Tajikistan and committed to continue supporting the country to make good quality health care accessible and affordable to all,” Dr. Natasha Azzopardi-Muscat, Director of the Division of Country Health Policies and Systems.
Two more workshops were organized to agree on next steps to further strengthen primary health care, and the health workforce. The marathon of events culminated in a winter school on health systems, held on 22-24 February. WHO experts facilitated informative sessions on health systems, each session focusing on a different component. The participants represented a variety of ministries, government institutions and committees. Through group work and discussions, the participants of the winter school enhanced their understanding of what actions and policies need to be taken to advance towards UHC.
The health systems marathon was made possible as part of the Health Development Programme, funded by the European Union. The EU is a strong partner of Tajikistan and has invested over 60 million euros in the last decade to achieve UHC.

19 January 2024
On January 18, 2024, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)  and the Agency for Securities Market Development and Special Registration of the Ministry of Finance of Tajikistan hosted a virtual meeting to discuss the development of Capital Market and Green Bonds in Tajikistan. The meeting, which included a presentation by ESCAP, was organized in partnership with the UN Resident Coordinator Office (UNRCO) in Tajikistan.
The event was opened by Ms. Nigina Abdurakhmonzoda - Director of the Agency for Securities Market Development and Special registration of the Ministry of Finance, who highlighted the main priorities in the development of capital market in Tajikistan. Mr Hamza Malik, Director of the Macroeconomic Policy and Financing for Development Division, ESCAP; Ms Parvathy Ramaswami, UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan and Mr Sattorzoda Jamshed, Deputy Head of the Department of Public Debt and Investment Attraction of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan delivered welcoming remarks.
Over 30 stakeholders from the public and private sectors attended the meeting, including representatives from the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan, the National Bank of Tajikistan, financial institutions, businesses, and development partners.
Parties reviewed the necessary steps that regulators, issuers, investors, and policymakers must take to build a green bond market in Tajikistan, leveraging ESCAP’s regional experience and technical assistance it has provided to countries in Asia-Pacific in the issuance of green bonds. The participants also discussed developing a regulatory framework aligned with international best practices. They underlined the importance of strengthening the domestic capital market in Tajikistan and scaling up financing for development.
It was noted that Tajikistan’s financing needs to address climate change, including meeting its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are significant. Thematic bonds, such as green bonds, can help developing countries to mobilize investments for green and sustainability initiatives.
Mr Majidi Yusuf Khairullo, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan, in his closing remarks, thanked ESCAP and UN Resident Coordinator’s Office for organizing this meeting and expressed his hope for continued collaboration with the UN system to build a vibrant capital market in Tajikistan.
Over the course of this year, the Agency for Securities Market Development of the Ministry of Finance will collaborate with ESCAP to further develop green bonds and capital markets in line with green and sustainable finance principles. A key area of this collaboration will be identifying opportunities and overcoming barriers for Tajikistan to issue green bonds through technical assistance and capacity-building of national stakeholders.

12 December 2023
DUSHANBE – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Government of Tajikistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to deepen their cooperation on addressing food and nutrition security for 2023 to 2026.
The Memorandum of Understanding was signed, between Adham Musallam, WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan, and Sirojiddin Muhriddin, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan.
This MOU lays the groundwork for WFP’s Tajikistan Country Strategic Plan (CSP) for 2023–2026, which aligns with the country’s national goals of improving food and nutrition security, strengthening capacities, and providing technical support for the government’s social protection programmes.
“The new Country Strategic Plan, valued at USD$ 91 million, is designed to support the government’s priorities for achieving food security and broadening access to high-quality nutrition by 2030,” said Adham Musallam, WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan. “Under the new CSP, the emphasis will be on supporting livelihoods, improving agricultural production, enhancing health, education, and nutrition outcomes, as well as strengthening national institutions and systems.”
The country strategic plan is consistent with Tajikistan's UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2026 and the government's national development goal through 2030. WFP will continue to provide on-demand logistics and procurement services to the government and development partners. WFP has been actively engaged in Tajikistan since 1993.

Title: Secretary-General's message on Human Rights Day

10 December 2023
“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” - UN Secretary General highlights the iconic opening sentence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in his statement on International Human Rights Day, stressing it is as important today as it was when it was adopted 75 years ago.
Full text of UN Chief's message on Human Rights Day 2023:
The Universal Declaration is a roadmap, helping to end wars, heal divisions and promote lives of peace and dignity for all.
But the world is losing its way. Conflicts are raging. Poverty and hunger are increasing. Inequalities are deepening. The climate crisis is a human rights crisis that is hitting the most vulnerable hardest.
Authoritarianism is on the rise.
Civic space is shrinking and the media is under attack from all sides.
Gender equality remains a distant dream and women’s reproductive rights are being rolled back.
Today, it is more important than ever to promote and respect all human rights – social, cultural, economic, civil and political – which protect us all.
The Universal Declaration shows the way to common values and approaches that can help resolve tensions and create the security and stability our world craves.
As we work to update global frameworks and make them more effective in the 21st century, human rights must have a unique and central role.
I call on Member States to use this 75th anniversary, and the Summit of the Future next year, to strengthen their commitment to the timeless values of the Universal Declaration.
And on Human Rights Day, I urge people around the world to promote and respect human rights, every day, for everyone, everywhere."

Title: Final Joint Steering Committee meeting and official closure event of the Spotlight Initiative takes place in Dushanbe

06 December 2023
The Government of Tajikistan, the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) conducted the final National Steering Committee meeting and official closure ceremony of the Spotlight initiative - a Joint EU-UN Initiative to Eliminate Violence Against Women and Girls in Tajikistan.
Representatives of key ministries, UN, EU, national and international organizations, civil society, media, youth, and activists joined the event to get familiarized with key results of the joint programme achieved during the programme lifespan and discuss the sustainability of key interventions as a next step.
During the final National Steering Committee meeting, summary of key results achieved cumulatively during the years of implementation from January 2020 to December 2023 were presented. It was stressed that the programme has achieved high-level results, including review and analysis of key legislation, policies, and procedures of Tajikistan, incorporated programme topics into the key national development policies, state programmes and action plans, strengthened inter-sectoral cooperation, raised awareness and knowledge of more than 99,284 individuals.
The programme also ensured provision of better medical and psychological services to those who have experienced violence, built the capacity of service providers, strengthened data collection for better planning and response and supported civil society and activists networking, capacity building.
Within the official closure event of the joint programme, information about key results of the initiative in Tajikistan were demonstrated, including highlights from the journey of Nuriya – a girl character that fights inequality, School of Gender Advocates, civil society organizations strategy and capacity building, knowledge platform, engagement of men and boys in prevention of gender-based violence, school reporting mechanism, women economic empowerment, among others.
“It is symbolic that we close this joint programme within the International Campaign of '16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence' that this year focuses on investing to prevent violence against women and girls. We are grateful to European Union for this unprecedented investment they made to bring the spotlight to the complex issue of the elimination of violence against women and girls”- said Ms. Parvathy Ramaswamy, UN Resident Coordinator.
“Investing in women and girls is our greatest and most underused path to accelerate the full achievement of the SDGs. We will only achieve the Goals if every woman and every girl, everywhere, can live a life of dignity and security, free from violence.”- she added.
H. E. Raimundas Karoblis, the EU Ambassador to Tajikistan noted: “This is the end of the programme, but not our commitment. EU continues to fight for the world that is free from any type of violence. We continue mainstreaming the gender-based violence as one of our top priorities in all our policies, programmes, and projects regardless of focus area. The 16 days of activism against the gender-based violence that is currently ongoing, is a good opportunity to bring the attention to this problem because the awareness raising that gradually leads to behavioral change is one of the most important factors, which ultimately will lead to the real change in every village, in every affected family.”
The Spotlight Initiative is a global, multi-year partnership between the EU and the UN to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. The overall vision of the Spotlight Initiative in Tajikistan was to ensure women and girls enjoy their right to a life free of violence. The funding of 7 million US dollars for the programme in Tajikistan contributed to the elimination of sexual and gender-based violence by responding to the needs of women and girls and addressing the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, as well as developing the capacity to prevent and effectively address domestic violence and other forms of abuse, using a multi-sectoral and intersectional approach.

OHCHR ROCA, UN Women and UNICEF co-organized with the Ombudsman Office the roundtable on Advancement of Human Rights in the Republic of Tajikistan dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 30th anniversary of the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as well as ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The event took place in Dushanbe on 5 December 2023.
Mr Umed Bobozoda, Commissioner for Human Rights stressed the importance of raising public awareness on human rights declared in UDHR and human rights treaties and ensure that everyone, especially vulnerable groups know how to claim their rights.
Mr Firuz Orzuzoda, Head of the Human Rights Guarantees Department of the Executive Office of the President underlined that “to ensure implementation of recommendations of UN human rights mechanisms, Tajikistan adopted more than 17 sectorial National Action Plans and a Strategy for Protection of Human Rights up to 2038 and its action plan”.
Mr Bahriddin Ziyoi, member of the Parliamentary Committee on Legislation and Human Rights, emphasized that UDHR inspired not only drafting of international human rights treaties but also served as a guidance for preparation of the national legislation of Tajikistan. “Chapter 2 of the Constitution of Tajikistan is solely devoted to human rights and freedoms”, he added.
Mr Pavlo Byalyk, UN Human Rights Advisor, on behalf of Ms Parvathy Ramaswami, UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, commended the Government on brining improvements into the normative human rights framework but emphasized that the adopted laws, policies and strategies should be effectively implemented. He encouraged all stakeholders to re-double their efforts to promote, protect and fulfil human rights of all people in Tajikistan, with particular focus on the most vulnerable groups in line with the principle “leave no-one behind”.
H.E. Raimundas Karoblis, Ambassador of the European Union to Tajikistan noted that “Human Rights do not originate in one region of the world and they do not reflect the interests of some countries. Human Rights belong to every human being and apply everywhere. Without human rights there cannot be lasting peace and justice in societies and globally.”
The roundtable was attended by over 80 representatives of state structures, civil society and international community who discussed achievements and challenges of Tajikistan in implementation of its human rights obligations with the focus on UPR recommendations as well as women and child rights.

In a significant step towards advancing public health initiatives and bolstering the well-being of the population of Tajikistan, a collaborative meeting between key development partners and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan (MoHSPP) took place on Tuesday. The meeting, organized by the European Union and World Health Organization, facilitated a constructive exchange of experiences, challenges and ideas to improve coordination and collaboration in order to enhance the overall health landscape in Tajikistan.
The afternoon session was moderated by the First Deputy-Minister, Dr. Mukhsinzoda. MoHSPP engaged a constructive discussion with partner organizations, focused on fostering stronger ties between development partners and MoHSPP. The meeting emphasized the importance of a unified approach to address health challenges and promote impactful and sustainable solutions, to create a more efficient and responsive healthcare system that ultimately translates to better health outcomes for the people of Tajikistan.
"The partnership between development partners and the Ministry is a crucial step forward in our collective commitment to prioritize and enhance the health and well-being of the population. By working together, we can pool our expertise and resources to address health challenges and effectively strengthen the health system," stated Dr. Mukhsinzoda, First Deputy-Minister of Health and Social Protection of the Population in Tajikistan.
The collaborative efforts underscore a shared dedication to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to health and align with the national health priorities outlined by the Tajikistan government. The meeting concluded with a commitment to strengthening coordination communication.
“The EU and the Government of Tajikistan share the vision of universal health care for all and efforts are undertaken to improve the health system of Tajikistan. That is why all development partners have gathered here today: to facilitate peer-learning, to exchange best practices and to continue foster collaboration. The EU is fully committed to support the health care reform in partnership with the government and all relevant health partners” – Marc Buchmann, Head of Cooperation of the European Union in Tajikistan.
The meeting was part of a full-day event of Development Coordination Council on Health, the main platform for development partners to exchange information and to support coordination.

Title: Tajikistan renews costed State Programme on Reproductive Health
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
28 November 2023
Following up on a commitment made at the Nairobi Summit in 2019, the Government of Tajikistan in August announced the renewal of its reproductive health programme for a four-year period ending in 2027.
The US$4.1 million programme is aimed at enhancing the accessibility, quality, and efficiency of reproductive health and family planning services, with a focus on the most vulnerable citizens, who make up over 75 per cent of the population and mostly live in rural areas.
The Government has allocated some US$740,000 for the programme from the state budget, with the remainder expected to come from international organizations, the private sector and other sources.
“Investing in reproductive health and family planning is one of the most cost-effective strategies for sustainable development,” said Dr. Zulfiya Abdusamatzoda, Deputy Minister of Health and Social Protection of Tajikistan. “People can plan their families with quality sexual and reproductive health information and services based on their values and personal circumstances.”
Although the contraceptive prevalence rate increased from 19.5 per cent in 1995 to 29 per cent in 2017, according to official statistics, this remains the lowest rate in Central Asia.
The programme will be implemented by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection with support from UNFPA and other partners.

Title: Dushanbe City launches the Voluntary Local Review process
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
09 November 2023
Dushanbe, the capital city of Tajikistan successfully launched the Voluntary Local Review (VLR) process and joined the growing global movement on the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The VLR was launched by Mr. Ashurboy Solehzoda, 1st Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade, Mr. Abdurahmon Abdurahmonzoda, Deputy Mayor of Dushanbe city and Mr. Lenni Montiel, UN Resident Coordinator a.i/UNDP Resident Representative. The organization of this event was supported by the UN Habitat within the framework of UN DA T14 project, UN Resident Coordinator Office in Tajikistan and UNDP. The round table was attended by the key official of Dushanbe Mayor’s Office, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, other state institutions and UN entities.
During the launch event a global methodology of the VLR preparation, concept note and the action plan on preparation and presentation of the Dushanbe city VLR were presented and discussed.
The overall VLR process will be curated within the project by UN-Habitat, UNECE, UNDESA, and UCLG that aims to support cities of Dushanbe, Tbilisi, Nis, and Bishkek in their VLR development to global and regional advocacy, learning and capacity building while creating opportunities to strengthen the multilevel governance arrangements.
Dushanbe will be the first city of Tajikistan to directly report to the United Nations on local progress toward the advancing Sustainable Development Goals. Modeled after the Voluntary National Review (VNR), which was presented by Tajikistan in 2023 at the HLPF, Dushanbe VLR will be officially presented in 2024 during the World Urban Forum to be held in Cairo, Egypt.
In 2015, UN Member States adopted “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (known as Agenda 2030) resolution comprising of 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets as a plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity. The member states report their progress towards the achievement of the Goals through a Voluntary National Review (VNR) to UN’s High-Level Political Forum (HLPF).
Local and regional governments are at the forefront of implementing solutions to advance sustainable development. In their sustainability efforts, a growing number of local and regional governments are using Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) as a valuable policy tool to structure the localization, planning, execution, and follow-up and review stages of SDG implementation.
Since 2018, almost 200 local and regional governments have conducted a VLR process. A Voluntary Local Review enables cities and regions to localize the Sustainable Development Goals and report their progress. In addition, the VLR enables the cities to strategically plan the sustainable urban development processes. Hence, VLRs have emerged as a powerful tool that forefronts local action.

30 October 2023
On 22 – 29 October, the UNODC Vienna Border Management Branch delegation, led by Chief Alan Cole and Tofiq Murshudlu, Head of Coordination, visited Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
The mission aimed to discuss the UNODC’s efforts in enhancing integrated border management and regional security with counterparts in Central Asia and explore the prospect of deepened cooperation in these areas.
During the visit, the delegation accompanied by Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia, Yusuf Kurbonov, UNODC International Programme Coordinator, and Sardor Atashikov, UNODC Regional Programme Coordinator for Central Asia, Passenger and Cargo Border Team, held a number of constructive meetings with the relevant counterparts and visited strategic border outposts and crossing points, newly established Border Liaison Offices at the border crossing points, Air Cargo Control Units (ACCU) at the international airports, and special economic zone at the Kazakh-Chinese border, among others.
In Uzbekistan, the delegation engaged in important meetings with key stakeholders, including the Director of the National Information and Analytical Center on Drug Control, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Border Troops, and the Deputy Chairman of the Customs Committee under the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The discussions focused on strengthening integrated border management and drug control efforts.
The delegation also visited the Customs Situation Center and the Aviayuklar ACCU at the Tashkent International Airport. That provided them with valuable insights into the ongoing initiatives and operations.
After their visit to Uzbekistan, the delegation had a mission to the Altynkol zhol Port Control Unit (established with the support of the UNODC Global Container Control Programme), the Nur Zholy border crossing point at the Kazakh-Chinese border (Special Economic Zone “Khorgos - Eastern Gateway”).
As part of their visit to Kazakhstan, the delegation met with the Director of the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre for Combatting Illicit Trafficking of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and their Precursors (CARICC) and the representatives of the Border Academy of the National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In the course of the meetings, the parties discussed cooperation, coordination, and partnership between UNODC and the agencies, including strengthening integrated border management.
The delegation attended an annual regional meeting of the Steering Committees established under the UNODC Regional Project on Enhancing Cross-Border Cooperation by Strengthening the Capacity of Border Liaison Offices in Central Asia of Sub-programme 1 Preventing and Countering Transnational Organized Crime of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia 2022 – 2025 held in Almaty on 24 – 25 October.
Addressing the meeting participants, Alan Cole highlighted that “integrated border management is becoming extremely important in today's world. The form of cooperation offered by border liaison offices is more important than it has ever been.”
Tofik Murshudlu noted: “There is a need for enhancing transborder cooperation. The project is one of the most impressive and successful examples of how it can be done in the right way not only in Central Asia but also in other regions.”
“Strengthening cross-border cooperation is very important not only for countering transnational organized crime but also for helping people to cross borders safely, promote legal trade, and ensure peace and security. Integrated border management is an answer to address transborder challenges and threats,” said Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia, addressing the meeting participants.
The representatives of the law enforcement agencies from Central Asian countries updated the delegation on the implementation of the project in their respective countries. They highlighted the importance of strengthening further cross-border cooperation and coordination of activities to address threats posed by transnational organized crime in the region more effectively.
Afterward, the delegation visited the Zhetysu ACCU at the Almaty International Airport, where they were introduced to the UNODC support at this ACCU.
In Tajikistan, the delegation met with the Commander of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan, Director of the Drug Control Agency (DCA) under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Head of the Customs Service at the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, and Head of the Counternarcotics Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan.
Due to rising security concerns and increased transnational organized crime in the region, Tajik law enforcement officials stressed the importance of strengthening border management and control in the region to counter terrorism and prevent illicit drug trafficking and weapons smuggling.
UNODC representatives acknowledged Tajikistan’s pivotal role in countering the security threats affecting the region and expressed readiness to continue support for the Tajik border and drug law enforcement agencies in further capacity building and infrastructure enhancement.
After the official meetings, the delegation visited the Coordination Center at the Border Troops Headquarters, the DCA Canine Center and the DCA Training Center established with the support of UNODC.
As part of the mission to Tajikistan, the delegation visited the Payvand border outpost, located at the Shahritus stretch along the Tajik-Afghan border. The strategic outpost constructed by UNODC contributes to the border officers’ operational capacity for 24/7 presence at the ‘green line’ border.
The delegation also visited new BLOs established with the support of the Regional Project on Enhancing Cross-Border Cooperation in Central Asia at the Ayvaj border crossing point located on the Tajik-Uzbek border and the Gulbahor border crossing point located on the Uzbek-Tajik border. BLO at the Ayvaj checkpoint is the eighth BLO located in the strategic tri-border area (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan) which contributes to enhancing cross-border cooperation, communication and information exchange between law enforcement agencies to counter transnational threats effectively.
Lastly, the delegation visited the Ayritom border crossing point and Termez Cargo Center logistics terminal located on the Uzbek-Afghan border.
The mission will make significant contributions to the UNODC’s ongoing endeavors in enhancing integrated border management and regional security in Central Asia and intensify interventions in these crucial areas.

Title: Roundtable discussion dedicated to 30th anniversary of the Principles relating to the Status of National Human Rights Institutions

26 October 2023
The round-table discussion dedicated to 30th anniversary of the Principles relating to the Status of National Human Rights Institutions (“the Paris Principles”), co-organized by the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Tajikistan and OHCHR Regional Office in Central Asia took place in Dushanbe. The event brought together more than 50 participants representing government structures, civil society, UN agencies and international partners.
The round-table discussion provided an opportunity to take stock of the work accomplished by the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Tajikistan (Ombudsman) to fully comply with the Paris Principles.
Representatives of Majlisi Oli of the Republic of Tajikistan, Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Finance participated in the round-table discussion to confirm their commitment to support the Ombudsman Office in implementation of the Sub-Committee’s recommendations.
Five thematic sections of the round-table discussion covered the themes of equality and non-discrimination, freedom from torture, protection of the rights of children with disability, business, and human rights, as well as women’s rights. Those discussions comprised brief interventions from both, representatives of the Ombudsman Office and their respective partners from CSOs which reflected good cooperation between Ombudsman and civil society.
Currently, Tajikistan’s Ombudsman has been accredited with status “B” which means that it partially complies with the Paris Principles. It must implement a series of recommendations of the Sub-Committee on Accreditation to achieve full compliance (status “A”). Those recommendations cover the issues of appointment, immunity, diversity of staff and adequate funding.
The Paris Principles ('Principles Relating to the Status of National Human Rights Institutions') set out the minimum standards that NHRIs must meet in order to be considered credible and to operate effectively. The key pillars of the Paris Principles are pluralism, independence and effectiveness.
The above-mentioned initiative is a part of the UN’s actions within 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The  Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a foundational blueprint for taking concrete actions to stand up for human rights and tackle pressing global issues today. In 2023 the world marks 75th anniversary of UDHR. The UN is commemorating this important anniversary with a year-long campaign to raise awareness and promote the Declaration and what it means for humankind. The campaign will have three main goals that focus on universality, progress and engagement under the leadership of UN Human Rights.

Title: UN expert commends progress but calls for greater effort to ensure rights of minorities
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 October 2023
DUSHANBE (19 October 2023) – Despite progress and good initiatives recently adopted by the government of Tajikistan, much more needs to be done to implement and protect the human rights of religious and other minorities, a UN expert said today.
In a statement at the end of a 11-day mission, Fernand de Varennes, the UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues said he was encouraged by the commitment and enthusiasm of many younger officials who seemed genuinely eager to improve the Government of Tajikistan’s efforts in relation to the implementation of its international human rights commitments.
“All too frequently I also encountered a lack of understanding as to what this entails, even to the point of outright hostility or denial,” the expert said. De Varennes expressed particular concern towards the Jughi (Roma) community, users of sign languages, Uzbeks, religious minorities and the Pamiri community in GBAO in several aspects, including their representation in the National Parliament, access to education in their mother tongue and freedom of religion.
He strongly recommended that the country continue efforts to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and urged the revision of legislation to include the Roma (Jughi) minority in the National Action Plan. Regarding violent events occurring in the GBAO region from November 2021, the Special Rapporteur called for an impartial and transparent investigation according to international standards and measures to prevent tensions and escalation of violence in the region.
“Responding to the grievances of the Pamiri minority is an important part of that de-escalation,” he said.
“Tajikistan has shown willingness to cooperate and engage with the international human rights mechanisms, but it has not been enough,” de Varennes said. “The recently adopted National Strategy on Human Rights and Action Plan, as well as the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan on Equality and Non-Discrimination are a good start but measures need to be taken to ensure the rights of minorities in the country,’’ he said.
The Special Rapporteur will present a full report on his visit to the Human Rights Council in March 2024.

Title: WFP builds bridges in Tajikistan, paving the way for rural prosperity
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 September 2023
DUSHANBE – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Government of Tajikistan today inaugurated two WFP-funded bridges over the Yaghnob river, at a ceremony attended by Rajabboi Ahmadzoda, Head of Sughd Region, along with representatives from the Ayni District and residents of the valley. The bridges will strengthen economic capacities and improve livelihoods and food security of rural communities in this valley of the Sughd Region.
Spanning 10 and 25 metres each, the bridges are strategically located just 105 kilometres north of Dushanbe and will serve as the lifeline connecting 10 villages within the Yagnob Valley. Previously, the absence of usable road bridges had frequently disrupted access to the valley's centre and inner villages for its residents, causing hardship and isolation.
"We believe in creating an enabling environment that spurs local economic development that enhances food and nutrition security”, said Charles Inwani, WFP Deputy Country Director in Tajikistan. “The Yaghnob bridges links rural communities that have much potential, to bigger markets for the agricultural products they grow offering them greater economic opportunities.”
The construction of the bridges was finalized in partnership with Welthungerhilfe and local authorities of Ayni district in Sughd Region. Under the supervision of WFP’s engineering teams and in collaboration with a local cooperative partner, the project generated employment opportunities for residents as equipment operators and drivers.
Improving local infrastructure to enhance livelihoods is part of WFP’s goal to achieve sustainable development, gender equality and food security in the remote and mountainous Yaghnob Valley.

Title: United Nations Supports Discussion of the Human Rights Strategy Implementation
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
05 September 2023
The round table “National Strategy for Protection of Human Rights in the Republic of Tajikistan until 2038: Prospects and Implementation”, co-organized by the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Tajikistan, OHCHR Regional Office in Central Asia and the Delegation of the European Union in Tajikistan, took place on 5 September in Dushanbe.
More than 60 participants, including government representatives, civil society activists and international partners discussed the implementation of the recently adopted National Strategy for Human Rights Protection.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Umed Bobozoda, the Commissioner for Human Rights, stated that “the National Strategy on the Human Rights Protection links all existing and future action plans aimed at implementation of the recommendations of UN human rights mechanisms”. “The Strategy and its action plan are an important tool for realization of the unified policy of Tajikistan in the area of human rights”, he added.
Mr. Firuz Orzuzoda, Head of the Department of the Human Rights Guarantees of the Executive Office of the President of Tajikistan highlighted that 142 action points of the Strategy cover practically all human rights areas. He also explained that its monitoring and evaluation will be done jointly in consultation with civil society.
Pavlo Byalyk, Human Rights Advisor in Tajikistan, speaking on behalf of UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, Ms. Parvathy Ramaswami, welcomed the adoption of the Strategy and stressed that while a policy and legal framework is important for human rights protection, it has to be complemented with the strong national human rights protection system, independent judiciary as well as political environment, conducive to the functioning of civil society. He also urged the Government of Tajikistan to make public pledges to ratify remaining human rights treaties, including CRPD and OPCAT, as part of the UDHR75 campaign.
The Ambassador of the European Union to Tajikistan, H.E. Raimundas Karoblis recalled that the adoption of the National Strategy was an important recommendation from the HRC Universal Periodic Reviews of Tajikistan. At the same time, the existence of the National Strategy is an important step in view of Tajikistan’s ambition to join the EU’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+). “While the adoption of the National Strategy is an important starting point, a thorough implementation remains essential to further advance human rights in Tajikistan”, the Ambassador emphasized.
During the roundtable, participants also discussed the Strategy and its action plan with focus on juvenile justice, equality and non-discrimination, rights of persons with disabilities, right to fair trial and due process as well as cooperation of authorities and civil society on human rights. All thematic discussions contained statements from both representatives of authorities and civil society organizations, who acknowledged their good and successful cooperation.

Title: UN Secretary-General’s "Early Warnings for All" Initiative launched in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 August 2023
The UN Secretary-General’s the Early Warnings for All Initiative (EW4All) was launched in Tajikistan within two-day national consultation with key stakeholders from state and international agencies, UN, media and civil society organizations.
The national consultation was co-chaired by the Deputy Prime-Minister of Tajikistan and the UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan with active involvement of the lead agencies  of  four pillars of the Early Warnings for All Initiative.
Deputy Prime Minister of Tajikistan, Mr. Sulaimon Ziyozoda, inaugurated the event, highlighting its significance by stating that the Republic of Tajikistan attaches importance to climate change, disaster risk reduction and supports the call of the United Nations Secretary-General to protect everyone with early warning systems. He also noted: “Coordination of activities of different sectors and stakeholders, involvement of communities at risk, availability of favorable institutional and legislative environment, clear distribution of roles and responsibilities - all these are necessary to create effective and consistent early warning systems”.
UN Resident Coordinator Ms. Parvathy Ramaswami said the launch of the Early Warnings for All initiative is “a crucial step forward in safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of Tajik communities from the impacts of climate change and other risks”, adding that “a whole-of-society approach involving all stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, will be critical for strengthening and sustaining the early warning services in the country”.
The representatives from relevant ministries, government agencies and development partners presented current advancements in implementing early warning systems in Tajikistan. They collectively identified challenges and prioritized strategies to expand the coverage, integration, and effectiveness of EWS.
The participants also engaged into technical discussions, mapping and a comprehensive gap analysis exercise, drawing from prior assessments, to identify the critical gaps and priority needs for support across the four pillars, agreeing  a coordination mechanism and  development of an action plan in the initiative’s implementation.
Tajikistan is faced with the frequent occurrence of natural hazards, such as avalanches, earthquakes, floods, mudflows, and landslides, with climate change further exacerbating their impacts. The Early Warnings for All initiative will build improved resilience to such risks in Tajikistan, with support provided across four interconnected pillars of EW4All: disaster risk knowledge; detection, observation, monitoring, analysis, and forecasting; warning dissemination and communication; and preparedness and response capabilities.
Globally one third of citizens are still not covered by early warning systems. EW4All Action Plan was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) held in Egypt in November 2022 for further investment across knowledge, observations and forecasting, preparedness and response, and communication of early warnings, with particularly priority placed on vulnerable communities.disaster risk
The Early Warnings for All Initiative calls for a global effort to ensure that such systems protect everyone on Earth by 2027. Early Warning Systems, supported by preparedness and early action, are a proven, effective, and feasible disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measure, that save lives and provide a tenfold return on investment. Yet, major gaps in early warning systems remain globally, especially when it comes to translating early warnings into risk-informed early action.

Title: Interview with Dr Markus Schefer, member of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 July 2023
Interview with Dr Markus Schefer, member of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, who has been visiting Dushanbe during the period of 3-7 July.
Dr Schefer was invited to the country by the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan within the framework of the global campaign to mark the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
UN RCO: Dr Schefer, could you please tell us about yourself and the goal of your visit to Tajikistan?
Dr Schefer: I am a member of the U.N. Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and a professor of constitutional and administrative law at the University of Basel, Switzerland. This Committee consists of 18 independent experts from all over the world. We are elected by the State parties for four-year-terms. As independent experts, we do not represent the views of our home countries. We meet twice a year for a time between 3 and 5 weeks. Our main obligation is to monitor the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the member states.
UN RCO: Please tell us more about the status of ratification of the Convention globally and the work of the Committee.
Dr Schefer: Today, 187 countries out of 193 UN member states have ratified the Convention; there are only a handful of countries that have not. Kazakhstan ratified it in 2015, and Uzbekistan in 2021. I have visited both countries and I was Rapporteur for Kazakhstan in the review process. In our work, we notice that it is crucially important that countries start a process toward implementation of the Convention, at whatever level they are. In this process, it is equally important to closely consult with organizations of persons with disabilities. They are in a position to identify where the most pressing issues are and what possible remedies may be.
UN RCO: How many persons with disabilities live in the world and how effective are countries in addressing their needs and guaranteeing their rights?
Dr Schefer: In general, we can assume that about 20% of any given population has a disability. For many, this is a surprisingly high number. We are surprised, because we usually do not meet many persons with disabilities in public spaces, be it in the streets, in schools, at work or in recreational activities. The main reason is that many persons with disabilities cannot participate, be it for lack of accessibility, lack of education, non-inclusion in the workplace or particular obstacles for political participation. This is what the CRPD is designed to remedy.
UN RCO: In your opinion, when Tajikistan will be ready to ratify the Convention?
Dr Schefer: Today, Tajikistan is ready for ratification. It is intensively working on many projects designed to implement the rights of persons with disabilities. Ratification would add crucial support to these efforts. Particularly the State party review process, in which our Committee issues recommendations to the State, provides guidance for further measures by the State. There is no threshold of implementation that would have to be achieved before ratification. The sooner a country ratifies the Convention, the clearer the path for the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities becomes.
UN RCO: What are other important things a country needs to keep in mind to proceed with the ratification process?
Dr Schefer: All across the world, I hear the argument that tight finances do not allow to take substantial steps toward implementation of the rights of persons with disabilities. This view overlooks the fact that there are many measures a State party needs to take that do not involve large expenditures. Walking around Dushanbe, I see a great many new buildings, including high-rises, being erected. If the proper accessibility standards are considered from the beginning of the planning process, rendering new buildings accessible will come at very little extra cost. This is a chance for Tajikistan; it allows the country to utilize its rapid economic development to substantially further the rights of persons with disabilities.
I have also met many people who think that the Convention is solely about services for persons with disabilities. To be sure, it does contain many rights to services. But it is not confined to these rights. It also guarantees civil and political rights, such as the right to participate in political and public life, or the right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment. Particularly political participation of persons with disabilities is of central importance for the peaceful development of any political system, as they represent a very large minority of about 20% of the population.
UN RCO: What is the experience of countries which ratified the Convention most recently? Which challenges they experience?
Dr Schefer: Implementing the Convention not only requires to change the laws and to implement them properly. It also requires, on a much more fundamental level, that society’s attitudes towards persons with disabilities change. That an impairment of a person is not seen as a medical aberration that renders the person less valuable, but that impairments are but one aspect of the great diversity of human beings. And that we value and cherish this diversity, as we do it in many other societal sectors. Such change takes time, and it does not occur on its own volition. Every single State party in whose review I have participated is confronted with many challenges, irrespective of its economic or political power.
UN RCO: What would be your advice to the Government of Tajikistan in terms of the timing for ratification of the Convention?
Dr Schefer: With all appropriate deference and humility, I would suggest that Tajikistan is ready for ratification. There is no need to wait, and there are no advantages of postponing ratification. As this year marks the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN will host a high-level event with participation of the Heads of States and Governments on 11-12 December in Geneva, Switzerland. This will be an opportunity for UN Member States to submit their pledges on transformative changes and progress in the cause of human rights. In this context, I would urge the Government of Tajikistan to submit a pledge on ratification of the CRPD as this is one of the two core human rights Conventions not ratified by the country yet.

The seminar aimed at discussing key findings of the research on the same subject held earlier in 2023 by the Bureau and supported by the UN Office of the Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan.
In his opening remarks, Pavlo Byalyk, Human Rights Advisor in Tajikistan, noted the importance for authorities in Tajikistan to strengthen existing and create new channels of participation for civil society in the processes of policy and decision-making through building partnerships based on trust and professionalism. “The research held by the Bureau demonstrates how much diverse and useful work has already been done by NGOs in cooperation with national and local authorities in Tajikistan”, he continued.
Madina Usmanova from the Bureau, who led the research on models of cooperation between authorities and civil society, explained that the initiative was dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights as civic space is a red thread that binds together all human rights proclaimed in the Declaration.
During the seminar, its participants discussed the findings of the research, presented various models of partnerships between state bodies and NGOs as well as highlighted successes and results achieved. In the break-out group discussions, representatives of authorities and civil society identified the ways to strengthen their cooperation as well as outlined key thematic issues to be addressed by such cooperation.

TAJIKISTAN Today, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) celebrated a unique collaboration with the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies of the Republic of Tajikistan, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), local government, Tajik private sector and the Refugees, Children and Vulnerable Citizens (RCVC). The event showcased the success of UNHCR's programmes and projects, which have broadened support for refugees and the communities hosting them.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Mulugeta Zewdie, UNHCR Representative, said – “First and foremost, let us take this occasion to thank the government of Tajikistan for hosting refugee communities and providing support to them in accessing employment opportunities. Through this collaboration, both host communities and refugees benefit and contribute to the local economy..”
In similar collaborations, UNHCR has been able to implement projects that benefit both the local population and refugees. Refugees bring with them traditions, entrepreneurial spirit, skills, knowledge, and craftsmanship, and only need a chance to grow and flourish.
“As part of the cooperation with UNHCR, employment opportunities for representatives of vulnerable social groups, such as Afghan refugees, were generated. Earning income is crucial for refugees as it helps to rebuild their lives, regain their dignity and re-establish their independence while they are uprooted from their homelands.”, said Ms. Sarvinoz Junaidova, UNIDO national technical coordinator.
UNHCR has been present in Tajikistan for 30 years, working closely with the government to protect and assist refugees. Through collaboration with a wide range of government, development partners, UN sister agencies, and private sector, UNHCR has been able to ensure meaningful, effective, and quality support to the Government of Tajikistan.

17 May 2023
Committee of Emergency situations and Civil Defence under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan (CoESCD) in cooperation with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other partners conducted a three-day Simulation Exercise (SIMEX) in Tajikistan.
The main objective of the SIMEX was to test the preparedness and response capacity of key government and humanitarian actors in the unlikely event of mass arrival of refugees and a potential natural disaster in the country.
The event has provided ground for improvement of coordination between the governmental bodies and humanitarian and development actors and provided an opportunity for key stakeholders to test their emergency preparedness and response plans and identify gaps in their preparedness and response capacity.
The Chairman of CoESCD, UN Resident Coordinator, and UNHCR Representative, during their opening and welcoming remarks, emphasized the importance of the SIMEX in enhancing the preparedness and response capacity of key stakeholders. Speaking at the event, the UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, Mrs. Ramaswami Parvathy, said, "SIMEX is timely for bringing governmental authorities, humanitarian and development actors, and non-governmental organizations together to prepare for such challenges. We are here today to learn from each other, to share our experiences and expertise, and to work together to revise and develop strategies and plans that will help us mitigate the impact of these challenges on our communities."
The SIMEX was attended by representatives of UN agencies, humanitarian & development partners and around 20 Government counterparts from various ministries and agencies. Taking place from the 15th to the 17th of May, the simulation exercise, had its theoretical parts in Dushanbe and practical on-the-field simulation in the Temporary Refugee Accommodation Center of Jaloliddini Balkhi area.
The event is a testament to the commitment of key stakeholders in Tajikistan to work together to ensure that the country is prepared to respond to any emergency situation.
As of 30th April 2023, Tajikistan hosts 9,489 refugees and asylum seekers, most of whom came from Afghanistan and half of them have been living in Tajikistan for several years.

The event organized by the National Union of Persons with Disabilities with support of UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, took place with participation of government line ministries and organizations, representatives of Majlisi Namoyandagon, Majlisi Oli RT, international organizations, organizations of persons with disabilities, experts from Tajikistan and Kazakhstan.
The issues of creating employment opportunities for the persons with disabilities as well as creating accessible environment have been discussed during the round table.  The results of analyses of compliance of the legislation of the Republic of Tajikistan, especially the Labor Code of the Republic of Tajikistan and the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan "On Social Protection of Persons with Disabilities" with the principles of the UNCRPD with focus on the right of persons with disabilities  to work and the concept of reasonable accommodation in the context of employment of persons with disabilities were presented during the event.
Deputy Chairman of the Majlisi Namoyandagon, Majlisi Oli of the Republic of Tajikistan, Ms. Dilrabo Mansuri pointed out the importance of disability inclusion and policy measures to create enabled environment for employment of persons with disabilities as well as actions toward ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Ms Parvathy Ramaswami, UN Resident Coordinator noted: “Employment opportunities for persons with disabilities are crucial for them to live meaningful lives and are essential for their social inclusion. When we secure the rights of people with disabilities to employment, we move closer to achieving the central promise of the SDGs – “Leave no one behind.”
Mr Asadullo Zikrikhudoev, Chair of the Union of PWDs mentioned: “Improving employment opportunities for people with disabilities will promote an inclusive workplace that values all employees for their strengths. It provides employees with disabilities with equal opportunities for success, training, fair compensation, and advancement. True inclusion is about accepting differences and only this way we can ensure inclusive sustainable development”.

Title: UN expert urges Tajikistan to leave past behind and uphold freedom of religion and belief
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 April 2023
The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Nazila Ghanea, today urged Tajikistan to adapt and reshape its laws, policies and practices on freedom of religion or belief, saying this would help contribute to development, peace and understanding in the country.
“The shadow of the civil war looms very large over current laws and practices relating to freedom of religion or belief, and deals a heavy blow to it,” Ghanea said in a statement at the end of a 10-day visit to the country. She noted that the scope for the exercise of freedom of religion or belief falls alarmingly short of the guarantees of international human rights law to which Tajikistan is bound.
“Respect for freedom of religion or belief should be visible also in public manifestation and should apply to everyone, including women, religious and belief minorities, and children and young people. They should be allowed to enjoy this freedom together with others,” the UN expert said.
She recalled that freedom of religion or belief was linked to the need to allow for worship, observance, practice, and teaching, including in the public expression of traditions and culture. “It is inseparable from freedom of expression and association and allows independent associations and other civil society actors to contribute to an open civic space and the development of society,” she said.
During her visit, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with Government authorities in Dushanbe and travelled to Khorog in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (province). She met with the Ombudsman, members of Parliament, prosecutors, the Supreme Court, civil society organisations, representatives of religious or belief communities and representatives of the international community. She also visited a prison where political and religious prisoners were being held.
“I urge the authorities to look beyond their singular concern with extremism, terrorism and incitement, and to open their imaginations to the positive contributions of religion or belief to a harmonious and rich public life,” Ghanea said. “Religion or belief alone do not constitute serious risk factors for social life; they can actively contribute to development, peace and understanding,” she said.
The expert will present a full report on her visit to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in March 2024.
ENDS
In July 2022, the Human Rights Council appointed Dr. Nazila Ghanea of the Islamic Republic of Iran as the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and she took up the mandate on 1 August 2022. Dr. Ghanea is Professor of International Human Rights Law and Director of the MSc in International Human Rights Law at the University of Oxford. She has researched and published widely in international human rights law, including on freedom of religion or belief, and served as consultant to numerous agencies.
The Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council's independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organisation and serve in their individual capacity.

Title: FAO opened a new warehouse for the storage of obsolete pesticides in Vakhsh district
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
08 April 2023
In Tajikistan, there are around 200 mini-landfills where obsolete pesticides are buried near residential areas. Most of these pesticides are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are chemicals that persist in the environment and remain harmful for a long time. These toxic chemicals are often stored outdoors in leaky containers or buried in shallow trenches. It leads to further seeping into soil and water, harming the environment pose an extreme risk to public health.
FAO works to prevent the build-up of new obsolete stocks by introducing better agricultural practices, enhancing sustainability and resilience, reducing reliance on pesticide and ensuring better management of pesticides.  The project also works on improvement of the governance of the obsolete pesticides and, jointly with farmers, demonstrates and promotes alternatives to highly hazardous pesticides through Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices.
On 8 April 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Committee for Environmental Protection under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan (CEP) officially opened a new warehouse for the storage of obsolete pesticides. The store annex was built in a framework of the GEF/FAO project "Lifecycle Management of Pesticides and Disposal of POPs Pesticides in Central Asian countries and Türkiye".
The project aims to reduce POPs releases from obsolete pesticide stockpiles and contaminated sites, as well as strengthen the capacity for the proper management of pesticides. To achieve this, FAO has been working in close collaboration with the CEP to improve infrastructure at the Vakhsh obsolete pesticides landfill, including the construction of a store annex with a capacity to store up to 1000 tons of obsolete pesticides.
This marks an important milestone in the ongoing effort to address Tajikistan's environmental challenges related to obsolete pesticide and contaminated site management.
The main purpose of the store annex is to enlarge the temporary storage space available for obsolete pesticides and soils contaminated with high concentrations of pesticides. This will enable the remediation of various mini-landfills in the Khatlon region over the coming years.

"Under this initiative, FAO office in Tajikistan contributes to the better management of obsolete chemicals, as well as demonstrates the best practices in producing food with less chemicals. The recovery efforts will help to demonstrate how numerous abandoned landfills and areas around them can be returned to the safe and sustainable production in Tajikistan”, mentioned Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan. “Besides improvement of the livelihoods of people living in these areas, the improved pesticide management will have positive impact on environment, on conservation of the precious water resources and contributes to the fulfilment of country’s obligations under various international conventions”, he added.
To pilot remediation process, the project will start the transportation of the obsolete pesticides from the mini-landfills in Pyanj jamoat, Jayhun district of Khatlon region. Within the remediation work, 409 tons of POPs pesticides and 4769 tons of contaminated soil will be securely transported and stored in Vakhsh special landfill. The work is planned to be completed by the end of 2023.
Opening the store annex at the Vakhsh landfill is a significant step forward in addressing Tajikistan's environmental challenges related to obsolete pesticide management. FAO will continue to work closely with the government of Tajikistan to support the pesticide management and remediation of contaminated sites

On World Autism Awareness Day, we celebrate the contributions of persons with autism and renew our resolve to advance their inherent rights.
Despite important progress, persons with autism continue to face social and environmental barriers to the full exercise of their rights and fundamental freedoms, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
We must do better – by promoting inclusive education, equal employment opportunities, self-determination, and an environment where every person is respected. And as we do so, we also recognize the role of families, caregivers, and support networks in the lives of persons with autism.
Today and every day, let us fully recognize the active and diverse contributions of persons with autism to our societies – and let us work together with persons with autism to build an inclusive and accessible world for all.

Title: UN Human Rights Office enhances capacity of the Ombudsman Office to implement the law on equality and elimination of all forms of discrimination
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
17 March 2023
OHCHR in Tajikistan, in cooperation with NGO Nota Bene, organised a two-day training workshop for the staff of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Tajikistan (Ombudsman Office) on equality and non-discrimination issues. The workshop “The Right to Equality and Non-Discrimination”, held in Dushanbe on 14-15 March 2023, aimed at assisting the Ombudsman of Tajikistan in implementation of the Law on Equality and Non-Discrimination which entered into force in July 2022.

In his welcoming remarks Mr Umed Bobozoda, Commissioner for Human Rights in Tajikistan, stated that Tajikistan has implemented the recommendation of the Universal Period Review “to adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that provides effective protection against all forms of direct, indirect and multiple discrimination and access to appropriate remedies for victims of discrimination”.
“We are very proud that this important law has been adopted. However, there is much work, related to its implementation, ahead of us. This includes setting up of a specialized non-discrimination unit within my office (which is in the final stage of establishment), development and adoption of a series of by-laws and amendment of existing laws, as well as preparation of the first annual report on equality and non-discrimination”, he continued.
During the workshop, participants learned about UN Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures mandate-holders that work on non-discrimination issues. They discussed various notions related to non-discrimination, such as prejudice, stereotypes, stigma, principles of equality and non-discrimination, types of discrimination, as well as temporary measures. Under the guidance from an NGO trainer and two trainers from Ombudsman Office, they worked in small groups to consider the cases of discrimination to identity the grounds for discrimination and its consequences.
Mr Pavlo Byalyk, Human Rights Advisor in Tajikistan, stressed that discrimination is a serious human rights problem all over the world. He further stated that “Absence of discrimination complaints is not necessarily a sign that there is no discrimination. It is often an indicator that the complaint mechanism is not effective and that an awareness-raising campaign needs to be held, among vulnerable groups, so that they can effectively seek remedies for various types of discrimination they experience”.
OHCHR plans to continue its work on enhancing capacity of Ombudsman to ensure that his Office, as the institution in charge of processing discrimination complaints, knows how to address discrimination issues effectively. One of the next steps planned by the Ombudsman is to hold an information campaign in all regions of Tajikistan to present provisions of the Equality and Non-Discrimination Law and to explain to various population groups how to claim their rights under this law.
Note: the above-mentioned initiative is a part of the UN’s actions within 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The  Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a foundational blueprint for taking concrete actions to stand up for human rights and tackle pressing global issues today. In 2023 the world marks 75th anniversary of UDHR. The UN is commemorating this important anniversary with a year-long campaign to raise awareness and promote the Declaration and what it means for humankind. The campaign will have three main goals that focus on universality, progress and engagement under the leadership of UN Human Rights.

Title: Government of Tajikistan and United Nations mark 30th anniversary of cooperation
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 March 2023
The Government of Tajikistan and the United Nations hosted a high-level event to mark 30th anniversary of the UN’s presence in the country and productive partnership.
The event took place with participation of all UN partners, Government ministries and organizations, diplomatic corpus , international organizations, civil society organizations, mass media representatives,  activists and UN agencies represented in Tajikistan
The event highlighted the UN’s work since 1993 to support Tajikistan throughout its different stages of development. The partners had an opportunity to get acquainted with a  A photo exhibition titled “UN in Action: 30 years in Tajikistan” depicting partnership of  UN’s presence in the country.
Mr Farhod Salim, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Tajikistan noted: “30 years of productive cooperation with United Nations and Tajikistan's active participation in its agencies’ activities proved that the UN and Tajikistan have become reliable partners. We are confident that our country will further continue promoting global initiatives in the United Nations and will strengthen its cooperation with all UN member-states”.
Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator highlighted in her speech: “I am proud that the UN has been working hand in hand with the Government and partners to help Tajikistan realize its national development aspirations. Over the years, the nature of UN’s cooperation with Tajikistan has also evolved reflecting the needs and priorities of the country. Today, we have reached a new era. The era of “cooperation” versus “assistance.” And what better way to demonstrate this much more mature and elevated partnership than Tajikistan’s role in the global water agenda.”.
Within 30 years of actions in Tajikistan, UN contributed to achieving the peace and development in Tajikistan. Between 2005 and 2022 alone, UN Agencies provided more than 1 billion USD in development assistance. UN programmes cover a spectrum of sectors and topics. The type of assistance ranges from upstream policy development to capacity development of institutions to direct services and aid to the population. Within the new cooperation agreement between the UN and Tajikistan for 2023-2026, UN Agencies aim to deliver close to 370 million USD in development funding during this period.
Note: The Republic of Tajikistan became a full-fledged United Nations member as a new independent state in 1992. The first UN offices opened in Tajikistan in 1993 were the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) . The activities of UNMOT ensured the advancement of the peace process in Tajikistan, assisted in peacekeeping efforts, and provided urgent humanitarian assistance. In May 2000, on the initiative of the former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peacebuilding (UNTOP) was established based on UNMOT. Currently the UN works with the Republic of Tajikistan within the new Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2026.
The UN supports Tajikistan to achieve its national priorities. In the immediate years after becoming a UN Member State these priorities were largely related to conflict resolution, mediation, reconciliation, and reconstruction. Today, these priorities are focused on sustainable development, peace and security and human rights. The Resident Coordinator leads the UN Country Team (UNCT) to ensure the support of the UN is fully aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as well as to the National Development Strategy 2016-2030.

03 March 2023
On 2-3 March, UNODC conducted a national training on drug use disorder treatment systems quality assurance in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.
The event brought together 29 experts from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Population of the Republic of Tajikistan (MHSPP), republican and regional clinical drug addiction centers under MHSPP, the National Drug Addiction Monitoring and Prevention Center under MHSPP, and UNODC representatives.
The training aimed to increase the capacity of drug addiction professionals in the development of the national quality assurance system standards in line with the UNODC-WHO International Standards for Treatment of Drug Use Disorders and discuss the strategy of their implementation.
Mirzoali Rajabzoda, the Head of the Department for the Organization of Medical Services and New Technologies of MHSPP, highlighted Tajikistan’s comprehensive efforts in combating drug trafficking and assessing and addressing drivers that result in the increase of drug abuse. “The UNODC trainings add value to our country’s efforts and measures in these areas. Today’s training will enable key players in the drug treatment system to make the drug abuse treatment services more effective by bringing them in line with international standards and best practices of evidence-based medicine,” he said.
“During the training, the participants will have a unique opportunity to discuss important issues related to the development and institutionalization of a drug treatment services quality assurance mechanism. The introduction and implementation of this mechanism will improve the quality of drug dependence treatment in Tajikistan,” said Mustafa Erten, Head of the UNODC Programme Office in Tajikistan, in his opening remarks.
The training was delivered by Maria J. Zarza Gonzalez, UNODC international trainer from Spain and Naimdzhon Malikov, narcologist from the Republican Clinical Narcology Center named after Professor M. Ghulomov under MHSPP.
Upon completion of the trainings, the participants were awarded certificates. They noted the high relevance of the training for their day-to-day job.
“During the training, specialists, having received useful information, took part in group work to assess the existing drug use disorder treatment system in the context of their regions and at the national level, thereby conducting a review and brief analysis of the treatment services. It should be noted that such trainings are highly important for us. They will improve the quality of medical care, help to plan the treatment, will be the basis for conducting quality monitoring and evaluation of the availability of services and service providers for the treatment of drug use disorders,” noted Naimdzhon Malikov.
The training was conducted within the UNODC global project GLOJ71 “Treating drug dependence and its health consequences: Treatnet II” funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), in collaboration with Sub-programme 3 “Addressing drug use, increasing treatment of drug use disorders and preventing HIV/AIDS” of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia 2022-2025 and the UNODC Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Section.

02 March 2023
On March 2, 2023, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) of Tajikistan, in cooperation with the United Nations, organized a consultative meeting with the organizations of persons with disabilities. This consultation took place as part of the preparation of Tajikistan’s second Voluntary National Review (VNR) report. VNRs are nationally-owned processes for countries to take stock and report on the state of sustainable development.
Over 30 participants representing 20 civil society organizations discussed the priorities of persons with disabilities, reviewed the existing legislation and policies, and provided recommendations to the Government on changes as well as additional measures needed to improve them.
Ms Farida Alibakhshova, the UN RCO’s Disability Inclusion Consultant in Tajikistan, noted that “by signing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2018, followed by the adoption of the National Roadmap for its ratification, the authorities in Tajikistan have explicitly expressed their commitment to upholding the rights of persons with disabilities and inclusive development.” The dialogue that we had today- underpinned by the principle “nothing about us without us”- was important to assess where the Government stands now in creating inclusive environment and development.”
The consultation with persons with disabilities was one of many organized by the Government, in cooperation with the United Nations and civil society. These consultations were organized to ensure that the voice of vulnerable groups is heard and that all of them benefit from the country’s economic development.
“We fully realize the importance of reaching out to the most vulnerable groups in order to assess the impact of development on their lives”, said Ms Manuchehra Madjonova, the MEDT VNR Coordinator. “We appreciate the engagement and support of civil society organizations in the work with vulnerable groups and in organizing thematic discussions which helps us see how far we have progressed on the sustainable development goals or SDGs. We want to see the impact on various groups of society and ensure that no-one is left behind. Their expertise and experience are invaluable”, she added.
The UN Resident Coordinator Office in Tajikistan, together with other UN Agencies, has been coordinating technical support to the Government on the VNR process. Many UN Agencies are providing assistance and guidance, including OHCHR, UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF, FAO, UN Women, and WHO. In addition, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) organized a study visit to Uzbekistan in January as part of the VNR Twinning Programme.
Besides Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, Mongolia was also part of this programme. A Tajik delegation representing the government, civil society, and the private sector took part in this visit. During the visit, the three countries discussed and shared good practices in carrying out VNRs in their respective countries.
​
About VNRs
VNRs are a Member State led process to systematically review national progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda. Member States have the opportunity to share their experiences with each other by presenting the VNR to the international community at the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) and publishing their report online in the HLPF VNR database. VNRs are not an end in themselves, but rather an assessment and stocktaking exercise to assist in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. VNRs aim to assess the status of implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the national level, achieving just and equitable sustainable development for all will be impossible without also fulfilling human rights.

Title: Funding from USAID helps WFP respond to Rising Food Insecurity in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 February 2023
WFP News Release

Dushanbe, Tajikistan – The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman joined the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Country Director Adham Musallam in announcing a new $10 million award to support vulnerable households in response to rising food insecurity in the country.
The funding will enable WFP to support vulnerable communities to better meet their food needs and strengthen government capacity to address the impacts of concurring shocks. Approximately 200,000 people are anticipated to receive unconditional cash transfers, along with livelihoods support.
“As communities continue to be affected by ongoing crises, including the war in Ukraine, it is critical for WFP to continue its work in food security and resilience-building in Tajikistan. We thank the U.S. Government for this timely contribution and its commitment to ending hunger in Tajikistan and beyond,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan Adham Musallam.
The latest WFP food security assessment shows that the combined impact of remittance losses due to the conflict in Ukraine, and food price increases could exacerbate severe food insecurity in Tajikistan from one to eight percent, resulting in about 800,000 people falling into severe food insecurity. WFP is closely monitoring household-level food security and market situation, as well as mobilizing funds in support of food-insecure families in the country.
“USAID will continue to support Tajikistan's agricultural productivity and address growing food insecurity that has been exacerbated here and around the world by Russia's war against Ukraine. We are proud to provide Tajik families the resources to grow nutritious food for themselves as well as offer cash in exchange for work on community projects so that people can earn a livable income while, at the same time, making their communities more resilient,” said USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman.

Title: Inclusive junior field schools leave no one behind
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
14 February 2023
In the Republic of Tajikistan, one in four families has at least one family member working abroad. Representing about 10 percent of the total population, labour migrants from Tajikistan are predominantly men and mainly from rural areas. Families of labour migrants struggle to manage the farming work previously done by those who are away, they often face inequities and are considered a vulnerable and marginalized group with poor economic resilience.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in its work to improve gender equality, increases the capacity of women and youth left behind to fill the gap in family farm work through farmer field schools.
The FAO project "Empowerment of 'families left behind for improved migration outcomes in Khatlon, Tajikistan" is funded by the Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund and implemented jointly with International Organization for Migration (IOM), United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Women (UN Women). Within the framework of this project, 50 junior farmer field schools were established to educate up to 1 000 children in Dusti and Kulyab, Khatlon regions of Tajikistan. The first activities cover drip irrigation of crops, the cultivation of vegetables in greenhouses, organic farming methods, and technology to grow mushrooms in artificially controlled conditions.
Experts of FAO conducted a series of theoretical and practical “Training of Trainers” sessions for over 450 teachers, as well as instructors, students and junior farmers from 50 secondary schools in the two districts on the topics related to establishment of farmer field schools. The project will next monitor the junior farmer field schools and support them to ensure the benefits to family farmers are enduring and raise the livelihoods and well-being of farmers’ families.

The farmer field school (FFS) approach was developed by FAO and partners nearly 25 years ago as an alternative to the prevailing top-down extension method. It represents practical field exercises using direct observation, discussion, and decision-making to encourage active learning-by-doing. The FFS method is also an effective capacity building and extension approach for farmers.
Junior farmer field schools aim to increase awareness about healthy nutrition and sustainable use of natural resources among youth. The main goal of the schools is to create interest in agriculture, to coach youth in how to apply various advanced technologies to booster crops’ productivity and to promote sustainable agriculture.

Title: UNODC in Tajikistan: Contributing to effective border control and security by training border officers
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
17 January 2023
Tajikistan shares almost a 1,400km border with Afghanistan - the world’s largest opium poppy producer. That makes the country vulnerable to security threats and challenges posed by transnational organized crime.
The situation is challenged by weak security along the porous Tajik-Afghan border which mostly lies in incredibly rugged mountains, and it has been very difficult for the authorities to police it.
Training the border security and management agencies forms a key component for effective and efficient border control and law enforcement activities.
In Tajikistan, UNODC supports the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan through the enhancement of skills and expertise of staff and technical and specialized assistance.
In 2022, UNODC continued to strengthen the analytical and operational capacities of the Tajik Border Troops to better respond to threats of transnational organized crime to ensure effective border control and security.
Michael Kopper, Border Security and Law Enforcement Adviser, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Office at the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe, highlighted the nexus between terrorism, illicit drug trafficking and smuggling of arms. He noted that the successes of the Tajik Border Troops in countering these threats at the regional level would provide tangible benefits for global security.
Between July and December 2022, a series of training courses were conducted for 80 analyst and operations officers from the border units and divisions of the Tajik Border Troops. The trainings covered a wide range of topics.
During the trainings, border officers enhanced their capacities in conducting and managing operations and information and analytical activities to counter organized crime, including terrorism and violent extremism, illicit drug trafficking and arms smuggling. They improved their skills in using mapping software and analytical specialized software products.
The officers learned about how to counter drug smuggling through ‘green border’ zones and about technical tools to detect and identify narcotics and explosive substances.
They reviewed the national legislation that regulates operational search activities and enhanced their skills in conducting and coordinating joint operations with other law enforcement agencies of Tajikistan.
In addition, the trainings enhanced the officers’ capacities in analytical report writing and effective information-sharing with other law enforcement agencies, including the Drug Control Agency under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan - a coordinating institute of drug control, prevention and enforcement-related activities in the country.
“Tajikistan plays a critical role in countering cross-border crime, including illicit drug trafficking. UNODC trainings contribute to the enhancement of analytical, operational and information-sharing skills and knowledge of the border officers who are at the forefront of ensuring security and should be well equipped to respond to the security threats and challenges effectively,” noted Mustafa Erten, Head of the UNODC Programme Office in Tajikistan.
The feedback received from the participants at the end of the trainings was very positive. They noted that such highly informative and useful courses would enhance the efficiency of their day-to-day work.
Colonel Khushvakht Kishvarsho, Deputy Commander of the Border Troops, thanked UNODC and INL for their continued support in addressing security threats along the Tajik-Afghan border. He highlighted the UNODC’s important contribution to securing and managing the borders of Tajikistan through its border initiatives and projects. He noted that this support is vital for sustaining peace and security not only in Tajikistan but also in the wider Central Asian region.
****
The trainings were conducted as part of the Initiative on Strengthening Control along the Tajik-Afghan Border under the UNODC Programme for Central Asia 2022-2025. The initiative, aimed at strengthening the Border Troops’ capacities to counter transborder crime effectively, is in line with the National Border Management Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan 2010-2025.
The initiative is funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).

Title: Soils, where food begins: Tajikistan marks World Soil Day 2022
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
14 December 2022
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the EU Integrated Rural Development Project/TRIGGER and the State Design Institute for Land Management "Tojikzaminsoz" joined their efforts to organise the Scientific and Practical Symposium dedicated to the World Soil Day.

World Soil Day (WSD) is annually held on 5 December to focus attention on the importance of healthy soil and advocating for the sustainable management of soil resources. This year, WSD runs under the slogan "Soils, Where Food Begins" to raise awareness of the risks associated with soil nutrient imbalance and soil fertility loss. It highlights the role of soil in producing sufficient, safe, and more nourishing food.
Soils are paramount in our daily lives, providing key ecosystem services that are often forgotten and taken for granted. Food security is a global goal that requires consideration of multiple factors, where soil fertility is a fundamental building block for agricultural production systems.
Healthy soils lay the foundations of agricultural development, healthy and nutritious food production, and essential ecosystem services, which are crucial to our life as well as a sustainable future. We rely on soils for 95 percent of the food we consume. In fact, 33 percent of the Earth's soils are already degraded, and over 90 percent could become degraded by 2050. Soil degradation puts the ecosystems, climate and food security in great jeopardy.
The symposium raised awareness of the importance of soil quality for human wellbeing, food security and ecosystems. It united the relevant stakeholders who play a crucial role in soil management, including scientists, students, government representatives, and international organisations who work towards soil conservation.
The event gathered representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, Institute of Soil Management, Committee of Environmental Protection, young scientists, public and international organisations, academics, and farmers, with the invited local and international experts in sustainable soil management. During the first day, participants and the invited speakers and experts shared their experiences, research works and projects in soil conservation. The practical part included demonstrating chemical soil analysis and soil sampling methods in the laboratory and field.
"FAO has taken the lead in promoting sustainable soil management through its global soil partnership. With the increasing challenges, we face, maintaining healthy soils will secure better yields, ensuring better production and livelihood. As the main theme of the year highlights, the healthy soils are the better environment for people and nature," said Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan. "Therefore, we need to support the healthy soil as the prerequisite for our wellbeing," he added.
In Tajikistan, with seven percent of the land being suitable for agriculture, soil depletion represents a serious threat to water resources and jeopardises the state of food security. Considering the rapidly changing climate, soil degradation has never been more urgent, requiring prompt actions.
"We sincerely appreciate the FAO UN, GIZ and EU for their significant contribution and support in soil conservation and restoration in Tajikistan. Soil has all the nutrients and minerals needed for crops to grow. Unfortunately, we are still experiencing unsustainable soil practices that lead to erosion, degradation and draughts. It is crucial to work all together to preserve soil health for a common livelihood ", said Nosirzoda Jabbor, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Tajikistan.
The symposium served as a platform for exchanging knowledge and experience, improving collaboration among all the key parties, learning about the best local and global practices to preserve soil health and applying sustainable approaches in soil management. Healthy soils constitute the legacy of our future. It is time to scale up sustainable soil practices and increase investment in sustainable soil management.

Title: Tajikistan: Human rights defenders face increasing threats in climate of fear, says UN expert
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
09 December 2022
The authorities in Tajikistan must radically improve the situation of its human rights defenders, and dispel an intensifying climate of fear, a UN independent expert said today after a two-week official visit to the country.
“Some officials in the Tajik government are trying to engage positively with human rights defenders, and there has been some legislative progress. However, many of those who peacefully defend the rights of others are under increasing pressure,” the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Mary Lawlor, said in a statement.
“The situation of human rights defenders is deteriorating. Lawyers, journalists and others are being targeted for their human rights work. They have been confronted with a range of difficulties ranging from onerous administrative burdens, to harassment, threats, criminalisation, closed unfair trials and imprisonment,” Lawlor said. “A climate of corruption, the fear of persecution and a stranglehold on human rights defenders working on difficult issues have forced some to leave the country.”
The Tajik government should live up to its international obligations and commitments, and work with human rights defenders to build peaceful, fair and just societies.
During her visit, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with government authorities in Dushanbe, and also travelled to Khujand. She held discussions with the Ombudsman, members of Parliament, prosecutors, the Supreme Court and representatives of the international community. She also visited a pre-trial detention centre and met human rights defenders there. Her request to visit the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (province) was denied.
“The Tajik Government must realise that it is in its self-interest to promote and protect human rights defenders working to build just and fair societies,” Lawlor said. “I urge the Government to treat human rights defenders as allies, not adversaries.”
The Special Rapporteur will present a full report on her visit to the Human Rights Council in March 2024.
ENDS

Primary, the workshop contributes to safeguarding the rural population's food security and livelihoods. It gathered delegates from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, as well as FAO experts. It is the third time that Tajikistan has hosted such an important workshop, however, for the first time in person after two years of global COVID pandemic.
During the sessions, participants discussed outcomes of the 2022 national anti-locust campaigns,  preparation for the next ones, implementation of the Programme in 2022 and the work plan for 2023. It also covered the latest developments of the Automatic System of Data Collection (ASDC) and the Geographic Information System "Caucasus and Central Asia Locust Management System" entitled CCALM, risk reduction associated with locust control operations including through the use of biopesticides and innovative approach such as the use of drones.
"It is important to point out that FAO made significant progress in introducing and promoting advanced and innovative technologies for controlling locusts. It is the right time to make serious steps to shift from the traditional ways of locust management to a more advanced, environmentally friendly and sustainable one, "said Shoki Al-Dobai, Team Leader of Locusts and Transboundary Plant Pests and Diseases, during the opening ceremony. He added, "…sustainable management of transboundary pests like locusts can only be achieved with effective regional cooperation, hence, it is expected further steps are taken towards the creation of a permanent coordination body".
Locusts indeed pose a serious threat to agriculture in the region, with an area of more than 25 million hectares concerned. Locusts are migrant pests. During outbreaks, locusts attack all crops and plants, putting at least 20 million people at risk in the region.
"This event reflects work of paramount importance for ensuring food security at the regional level. It reflects the commitment of the governments and foresightfulness of donor organisations," said Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan. "In Tajikistan, we still need to develop a more participatory mechanism that will allow closer involvement of all stakeholders to redistribute responsibility for more effective locust control. This also includes a more sustainable financial mechanism, which will also to operate beyond the external support".
The “Project for Improvement of Locust Management (Phase 2)” (GCP/INT/384/JCA) has been approved in 2020 by the Government of Japan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to the benefit of six Central Asian countries, namely Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. This project, of a five-year duration and with a budget of USD 7.5 million, is part of the multifunded "Programme to improve national and regional locust management in the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA)", implemented by FAO since 2011.

Title: Tajikistan marks World Food Day 2022
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 October 2022
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Social and Industrial Foodservice Institute (SIFI) joined their efforts to celebrate World Food Day in Tajikistan to call for solidarity and joint actions to transform agri-food system.
The World Food Day 2022 (WFD) festival was organised under the slogan "Leave No One behind – better production, better nutrition, better environment, better life". The festival gathered up to 300 participants including government representatives, ambassadors, international and local NGO partners and civil society. WFD 2022 addresses inequalities and vulnerabilities in food that leave people behind and undermine the potential of individuals. It targets the groups that cannot afford healthy diets, which puts them at risk of food insecurity and malnutrition.
The festival compiled pavilions, master classes on a healthy and nutritious diet, theatrical performances and a photo exhibition dedicated to the main theme of the WFD. The event also showcased effective technologies and best practices in the agriculture sector. It highlighted the commitment to tackle inclusive and sustainable agri-food systems to ensure healthy, balanced and nutritious diets for all. During the event, the Government of Tajikistan, FAO and WFP underlined the shared responsibility of the global community to address the causes of hunger and malnutrition to ensure a healthy and balanced diet for all.
This year, organising agencies specifically highlight young people's role as the future change-makers who can build a better, more sustainable future. Different youth groups were engaged to WFD 2022 celebration as volunteers, participants and performers. Moreover, the festival incorporated an informative and entertaining zone for children. It included a photo zone with their favourite vegetables, insightful quizzes on healthy eating habits and interactive performance to underline the importance of a nutritious diet from early childhood.
In just two years, the number of acutely food insecure people has risen from 135 million to 193 million, and 2022 is likely to prove worse. According to the FAO and WFP Hunger Hotspots report, 820 million people live in famine conditions – more than five times as many as in 2020. Conflict, economic slowdowns, the climate crisis and environmental degradation, are major drivers of global hunger. The effects of COVID-19 have disrupted supply chains and limited people's ability to earn a living.
Collective action across 150 countries worldwide is what makes World Food Day one of the most celebrated UN days on the UN calendar. Governments, the private sector, academia, youth, civil society and individuals need to work together in solidarity to prioritise the right of all people to food, nutrition, peace and equality. Everyone can work towards an inclusive and sustainable future, showing greater empathy and kindness in our actions. It is time to work together and create a better, more sustainable future for all.

18 October 2022
On 18 October, UNODC Regional Office for Central Asia (UNODC ROCA) organized a side event “UNODC integrated border management and countering terrorism portfolio in Central Asia” on the margins of the high-level conference “International and Regional Border Security and Management Cooperation to Counter Terrorism and Prevent the Movement of Terrorists” held on 18-19 October 2022 in Dushanbe.
The event brought together representatives from the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, government agencies and civil society organizations from other countries, diplomatic missions, international development partners, UN agencies, and media, among others.
“Promoting regional cooperation and strengthening border management and security is an important pillar of the UNODC technical cooperation programme in Central Asia. There is a need for concerted action and appropriate solutions, based on solid experience and best practices, to mitigate risks and threats to safety and security posed by organized cross-border crime in the region,” said Ms. Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia, in her opening remarks.
Mr. Masood Karimipour, Chief of the Terrorism Prevention Branch, UNODC Headquarters, noted that “UNODC recognizes the challenges that states face in addressing these threats and we have recently launched a new Global Programme on Preventing and Countering Terrorism which will guide our work to support the Member States, and which increasingly takes a people-centered, inclusive and preventative approach. We look forward to supporting the states in Central Asia to address their complex and transnational challenges related to terrorism at their request.”
Mr. Yusuf Kurbonov, UNODC International Programme Coordinator and UNODC ROCA team briefed the participants on the UNODC’s current programme portfolio, expertise and knowledge resources on counterterrorism, integrated border management, prevention of violent extremism and other dimensions of cross-border cooperation to prevent the movement of terrorists.
The briefing also provided a presentation of the newly launched project “Enhancing border management and security in response to terrorist threats in Central Asia”, funded by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.
“Terrorism does not stop at borders, and it is, therefore, crucial that border management is strengthened. It is key to protect the Central Asian states against a possible spillover of terrorists from Afghanistan and to prevent the deterioration of security, stability, and human rights in the area,” noted Dr. Andreas Prothmann, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Federal Republic of Germany to the Republic of Tajikistan.
The event provided a platform for discussions of organized cross-border crime threats and challenges and ways to address them effectively.
Ms. Ashita Mittal reiterated the UNODC ROCA’s commitment to continue and expand its programmes in the region in partnership with the governments, civil society and all other bilateral and multilateral stakeholders.
UNODC has been present in the Central Asian region since 1993. It supports the five Central Asian countries in addressing the trafficking of illicit drugs, people, firearms and commodities, preventing and countering organized crime, corruption, violent extremism and terrorism, as well as promoting drugs and crime prevention and criminal justice and rule of law reforms.
On the margins of the high-level international conference, UNODC organized an exhibition to showcase its work and achievements in border management and security and countering terrorism in Central Asia.

07 October 2022
To mark the the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Committee of Emergency and Civil Defense joined hands with UNDRR and UNICEF to organize a Children’s Drawing Contest in Dushanbe, with financial support from the EU and USAID BHA
A children’s drawings contest was held on Friday in Dushanbe to mark the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction (IDDRR), which is celebrated globally on 13 October.
With financial support from the European Union and USAID’s Bureau of Humanitarian Affairs, the contest was co-organized by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), in collaboration with the Committee for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense of the Government of Tajikistan (CoESCD), and the Government of Switzerland.
In 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched “The Sendai Seven Campaign” to promote each of the seven targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction over seven years. In 2022, the International Day focuses on Target G of the Sendai Framework: “Substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030.”
Communicating disaster risk information and advocacy in disaster risk reduction is often challenging due to the lack of clear understanding of hazards and risk, proper knowledge of how to identify then as well as cultural beliefs and specific risk perception. As a result, certain vulnerable groups, especially children and youth, suffer disproportionately when disasters occur. It is therefore important that people-centered early warning systems and preparedness enable early action to minimize the harm to people, assets, and livelihoods.
Approximately 80 children and youth participated at the drawing contest, which aimed at raising their awareness on the global environment, disaster risk reduction, the impact of climate change and the need for joint efforts in protecting the planet and preventing hazards.
In his opening speech, the First Deputy Chairman of the CoES, Mr. Hotamsho Latifzoda noted that: "The main purpose of such events is to popularize the culture of safe living among the younger generation, to inform the general public of the importance of the task of prevention and awareness-raising among the population who are most at risk of becoming victims of natural, environmental and man-made disasters, regarding the available means for preventing the escalation of dangers into disasters."
“You have to know that art makes children powerful and our future in your hands, so let’s make the world a much better place for living”- highlighted Salome Steib, Director of the Swiss Cooperation office in Tajikistan.
“Today another important message is conveyed: “Early warning and early action for all”. It means: “take early action”, because early action can save lives. The primary goal of disaster risk reduction is prevention. But when that is not possible, then it is important that the populations and sectors that are at risk can receive the alert, understand it, and most importantly, act on it,” – said Mr. Giuseppe Aristei, Programme Manager, EU Delegation to Tajikistan.
Mr. Octavian Bivol, Chief, UNDRR Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, highlighted in his opening remarks: “Investing in building the preparedness of children pays off in not only enabling them to protect themselves, but they also become agents of change who can build the resilience of their families and communities by sharing what they learned”.
Other UNDRR-led activities for raising awareness on disaster risk reduction amongst children and youth in Central Asia within the EU-funded project include the Sing for resilience contest and the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction 2022 quiz.
Background information
About the IDDRR
The United Nations General Assembly has designated 13 October as the IDDRR to promote a global culture of disaster risk reduction. It is an opportunity to acknowledge the progress being made toward reducing disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Japan in March 2015.
The Sendai Framework has seven global targets and 38 indicators for measuring progress on reducing disaster risk and losses. These indicators align the implementation of the Sendai Framework with the Paris Agreement on climate change towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
In 2016, the UN Secretary-General launched “The Sendai Seven Campaign” to promote each of the seven targets over seven years. In 2022, the International Day will focus on Target G of the Sendai Framework: “Substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030.”
To raise awareness and mobilize action around these calls, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) is using the 2022 IDDRR, to call for greater investment in expanding early warning and early action for all.
People-centred early warning and preparedness systems can enable early action to minimise damage to people, property and livelihoods. Early warning systems should ensure that populations and sectors at risk can receive a warning, understand it and, most importantly, take action. Hence, early warning should initiate early action that is well prepared and tested.

Title: WFP fosters experience sharing on wheat flour fortification between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
06 October 2022
Representatives from Tajikistan state institutions, wheat flour mills and the private sector have completed a four-day study tour to Uzbekistan to get familiar with the implementation of Uzbekistan’s regulatory framework for wheat flour fortification. The visit was organised by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in partnership with the Government of Tajikistan.
During the study tour, participants received information on regulatory framework and millers’ experience and achievements on wheat flour fortification in Uzbekistan, the procurement of micronutrient premix and support provided to millers in the country. Uzbekistan has an extensive experience fortifying food with minerals and vitamins, particularly wheat flour.
“This gives us the opportunity to learn about success stories, and institutional and legal frameworks on wheat flour fortification in Uzbekistan. This visit will further strengthen the implementation of the Law on Food Fortification and the National Programme for Prevention of Micronutrient Deficiency and Related Diseases among the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2022-2027,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan Adham Musallam.
“WFP is committed to provide technical support to the Government, the private sector and relevant ministries and departments to promote wheat flour fortification in Tajikistan,” he added.
Fortification is one of the most cost-effective means of combating micronutrient deficiencies, which remains a public health issue, particularly for women and children in Tajikistan. Malnutrition can lead to the development of diseases and chronic health conditions.
The Government of Tajikistan adopted several strategic documents to eliminate micronutrient deficiencies among the population and has identified food security and nutrition as one of the country’s four strategic goals in the 2016-2030 National Development Strategy.
WFP is the only agency that brings fortified food, including fortified wheat flour and vegetable oil, to the country. Through the National School Feeding Programme, around 450,000 primary grade schoolchildren in 2,000 schools receive daily hot meals prepared with these nutritious ingredients.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Title: Tajik judges enhance their capacity to apply new housing code
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
05 September 2022
Nineteen judges from the Sughd region of Tajikistan have been trained on international standards on the right to adequate housing and how to apply the provisions of a new Housing Code which entered into force on 1 September 2022.
A two-day training for judges “The right to adequate housing and a new Housing Code” was conducted jointly by the NGO “Independent Centre for Human Rights” and the Supreme Court with the support of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) Regional Office for Central Asia. The training seminar took place in Guliston, Sughd region, on 2-3 September 2022.
Mr. Shodmon Alizoda, Chairman of the Judicial Board on Family Affairs of the Supreme Court of Tajikistan, in his welcoming remarks noted that a new Housing Code contains multiple legislative innovations which have to be carefully studied to ensure their correct application.
He also stressed the importance of partnership with civil society: “We greatly appreciate our continued cooperation with the “Independent Centre for Human Rights”, whose experts have provided us with important expertise during the process of elaboration of the Housing Code and continue providing their support after the Code has been adopted”.
Mr. Suhrob Shoev, OHCHR National Programme Officer, emphasized the interdependence and interrelation of all human rights. He noted, “The right to adequate housing is key for the realisation of many economic, social and cultural rights and is linked, in particular, to the rights to health, education and employment”. He added, “Ensuring the right to adequate housing, especially for vulnerable groups, is an important driver in achieving SDGs”.
During the training, participants learned about the legal safeguards of the right to adequate housing as well as the rights and obligations of homeowners and members of their families. A separate training session was dedicated to the discussion of real-life cases related to protection of the right to adequate housing and adequate compensation. In addition, participants discussed the role of media in the coverage of forced evictions as well as challenges to the effective implantation of the law “On Access to Information about Activities of the Judicial Bodies”.
“Although a number of issues remain to be discussed, the seminar was very helpful in clarifying approaches to application of the new Code’s provisions”, said Ms. Mavjuda Pulodi,  a judge of the Supreme Court. “To enjoy the trust of the citizens in Tajikistan, judges need to ensure that administration of justice, in particular related to the right to adequate housing, is transparent, fair and impartial”, she remarked.
As per feedback from participants, the OHCHR will consider organising similar training for judges in other regions of Tajikistan and, to make such capacity building activities sustainable, to support train-the-trainers seminars as well as development of thematic training modules for the Supreme Court’s Judicial Training Centre.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
02 September 2022
Experts from the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction of Tajikistan and related national agencies, international and local organizations, and representatives of academia participated in a workshop to validate the results of a stress test of the country’s disaster risk management system. The workshop was funded by the European Union (EU) and organized by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) within the joint project on disaster risk reduction in Central Asia.
The initial workshop to stress test Tajikistan’s disaster risk management system was held in July 2022, with the analysis of the stress test, compiled by UNDRR, validated by the stakeholders during Friday’s workshop. These workshops follow a comprehensive capacity assessment and planning exercise of Tajikistan’s disaster risk management system, which was conducted by the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense and UNDRR in May 2022. The assessment revealed challenges in the existing disaster risk management system and suggested a targeted plan for strengthening it, which were also presented at Friday’s workshop.
The stress test analysis is the first of its kind supported by UNDRR in Central Asia. Its results will contribute to further strengthening the DRM system and an increased understanding of the complex disaster risks in the country.
Mr. Tojiddin Mahmadov, the representative of the Main Department for Protection of Population and Territories of the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense highlighted: “Strengthening national institutional capacity for disaster prevention and preparedness, taking into account the occurrence of possible stresses, such as complex and cascading disasters, are among the main areas of action of the National Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for Disaster Risk Reduction 2030 in the development of a disaster risk management system”
Mr. William Lindberg, Programme Manager of the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Tajikistan, said that “the EU is strongly committed to continue supporting the DRR sector in the country. This is reflected in our 2021-2027 budget, where DRR has an important role under one of the identified priority areas. We are currently engaging with our partners, including UNDRR, to map the sector and identify potential areas of support in the future”.
Mr. Abdurahim Muhidov, UNDRR Regional Programme Coordinator, noted: “The ability of a country to predict, assess, and reduce risk and minimize possible losses depends on the national vision and commitment. Such ability can be created with collective effort with engagement of all stakeholders”.

01 September 2022
The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, completed the construction works at the Balkhi temporary accommodation center and handed over the completed infrastructure to the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense of the Republic of Tajikistan.

As part of the collective refugee emergency preparedness efforts, in October 2021, the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense (CoESCD) together with UNHCR and other international organizations started the construction of a temporary refugee accommodation center within the existing Anti-Hail Centre in Jaloliddin Balkhi district in Khatlon province. The temporary settlement was established for the accommodation of refugees that could also be used to shelter persons affected by natural disasters as well as for simulation exercises and training of rescue staff. The Anti-Hail Center belongs to CoES and is 52 km away from the Tajik-Afghan border.
UNHCR, in partnership with other humanitarian agencies within Refugee Coordination Model, has engaged in various humanitarian and development actors together to construct temporary accommodation facilities, water pumping and drainage, setting up electricity lines, an electricity transformer, and power generators. UNHCR, together with the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH), carried out construction works on the installment of a temporary shelter, the Refugee Housing Units, while UNICEF built all the related Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) infrastructure, including the installment of the water tower to provide the settlement with continuous access to water. The total UNHCR contribution to the Center amounted to USD 411,618. The capacity of the Balkhi temporary accommodation center allows to host up to 500 individuals. As of now, all the planned construction works have been completed, and the settlement has been handed over to CoESCD for use in case of refugee emergencies or natural disasters.
“The Balkhi refugee accommodation center – is a unique product of joint coordination and collaboration of multiple humanitarian and development partners, who brought together their capacity, resources, and knowledge to support the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense in preparation to the possible refugee emergencies.” – said Mr. Mulugeta Zewdie, UNHCR Representative in Tajikistan during the Handover Ceremony.
The Center was created against the background of unstable security and political situation in neighboring Afghanistan last year when government structures and the international community remained at a high level of alert and preparedness for the possible emergency.  On March 18 this year, Balkhi temporary accommodation center saw the visit of Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, who also appreciated the collective efforts undertaken to create the Balkhi settlement and encouraged all engaged in continuing this positive cooperation.

Title: Authorities in Tajikistan Discuss the Linkages Between Human Rights and Sustainable Development Goals
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 August 2022
Representatives of sixteen state institutions of Tajikistan came together for two days to discuss the interrelations between the protection of human rights and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
A two-day workshop “Applying human rights-based approach to development in the context of implementation of the Agenda 2030” was organized by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights' (OHCHR) Regional Office for Central Asia. The training took place in Varzob from 24-25 August 2022 in a hybrid format and included presentations and practical exercises.
The workshop aimed at increasing the understanding of human rights focal points from various state institutions on the human rights protection as a key precondition for development, and on the practical side - on how reporting on human rights and human rights-based approach to data can be used for reporting on implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In his welcoming remarks, Mr. Aziz Solehzoda, the Leading Specialist of the Department of the Human Rights Guarantees of the Executive Office of the President of Tajikistan underlined that “the implementation of SDGs and the realization of human rights are interconnected and reinforcing processes” Mr. Solehzoda also stressed the importance of human rights for securing investments into the country’s economy.
Mr. Pavlo Byalyk, Human Rights Advisor with the Office of the Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan emphasized that a “Leave No One Behind” approach to development, which implies reaching out to and consulting with the most disadvantaged groups, is key for identifying development priority focus areas as well as the effective means to address them. “There can be no real progress in development, unless all people of Tajikistan, particularly the most excluded and marginalized groups, feel improvements in their lives”, he noted.
During the workshop, the participants learned about the international human rights mechanisms and their interaction with Tajikistan, discussed the structure and functioning of the Governmental Commission on Implementation of International Obligations in the field of Human Rights as a national human rights mechanism for reporting, implementation, and follow-up, as well as considered the ways of improving inter-agency coordination for preparing human rights reports.
The participants explored the links between the most recent recommendations Tajikistan received within the third cycle of the Universal Period Review with the SDG implementation and learned how to use the Universal Human Rights Index as an online tool for identifying thematic clusters of human rights recommendations and their relevance to SDGs.
Participants also were trained on applying a human rights-based approach to data and participated in a practical exercise on how to plan the implementation of the data-related human rights recommendations. In the context of Tajikistan’s expected engagement in the process of the Voluntary National Review (VNR) in 2023, participants also learned about the experience of other Central Asian states in applying human rights-based approach to the VNR reporting.
“We learned a lot during these two days about linkages between human rights and implementation of the 2030 Agenda”, said Ms. Odinazoda Mahtobbi, Deputy Chair of Social Development Department of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade. “It would be important to continue such discussions and focus them in the future on some selected SDGs”, she added.
The workshop was attended by representatives of the Department of Human Rights Guarantees of the Executive Office of the President of Tajikistan, Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights, Supreme Court, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Health and Social Protection, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labor, Migration and Employment,  State Agency for Statistics under the President of Tajikistan, Agency for State Financial Control and Combatting Corruption, Drug Control Agency under the President of Tajikistan, Committee on Women and Family Affairs, as well as the State Committee for National Security.

Title: EU-funded project supports stress testing of Tajikistan’s disaster risk management system
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
15 July 2022
Experts from the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction of Tajikistan, international and local organizations, and representatives of business and academia participated in a stress testing workshop of Tajikistan’s disaster risk management (DRM) system against the most impactful disaster scenarios in the country.
The workshop was funded by the European Union (EU) and organized by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) within the joint project on disaster risk reduction in Central Asia.
In May 2022, Tajikistan’s Committee of Emergency Situations & Civil Defense and UNDRR concluded a comprehensive DRM system capacity assessment and planning exercise, which revealed major needs and challenges in the system and suggested a targeted plan of action to strengthen the disaster risk reduction (DRR) policy implementation in the country.
As the next step of the process, EU-UNDRR project supported the National Platform to conduct a stress test analysis - a scenario-based multi-stakeholder assessment process to evaluate the state of national capabilities to reduce, absorb and transfer disaster risk and develop a targeted action plan to further support the strengthening of the DRM system. During the meeting, participants developed disaster scenarios for Tajikistan based on relevant sources, and prioritized required DRM system capacities against the disaster scenarios.
Over the past years, Tajikistan has made significant progress in increasing its capacity in DRM and in the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. As part of the work towards reducing disaster risks, Tajikistan has developed and adopted the National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2019, its implementation is guided by the National Platform for DRR. However, the increasing challenges posed by climate change and the rapid change of the global hazard trends may create strong stress for the DRM system of the country.

The theme of World Drug Day 2022 is ‘health and humanitarian crises’. To commemorate the Day, the UNODC Cross-Border Cooperation Project in Central Asia conducted the campaign to raise public awareness of illicit drug problems.
Central Asia borders Afghanistan - the world’s largest opium poppy producer. The region is on the front line of efforts to counter drug trafficking along the northern route.
Thematic public awareness-raising campaigns play an important role in the fight against illicit drugs. It is crucial to inform, in particular, young people, who make up more than half of the population in Central Asian countries about the risks posed by drug use and illicit drug trafficking.
The awareness-raising campaign was conducted at the Korday border crossing point (BCP) on the Kazakh-Kyrgyz border, the Sypatay Batyr BCP on the Kazakh-Kyrgyz border, the Ak-Zhol BCP on the Kyrgyz-Kazakh border, the Zhibek Zholy BCP on the Kazakh-Uzbek border, the Dusti BCP on the Tajik-Uzbek border, the Sariosiyo BCP on the Uzbek-Tajik border, the Gisht Kuprik BCP on the Uzbek-Kazakh border and the Aktau International Airport in Kazakhstan, the International Airport Manas in Kyrgyzstan and the Tashkent International Airport in Uzbekistan.
During the campaign, the UNODC team and law enforcement officers working at the BCPs and international airports placed information banners and disseminated fridge magnets among people crossing the borders. The messages on the banners and magnets were presented in English, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Russian, Tajik, and Uzbek languages.
A campaign video dedicated to the Day was shown at the arrival and departure terminals of international flights of the Aktau International Airport and the border terminal of the Sypatay Batyr BCP.
The UNODC representatives and law enforcement officers informed the citizens crossing the land and air borders about World Drug Day, the harmful health consequences of drug use and the legal consequences of illicit drug use and trafficking, among others.
The banners provided the following useful information: “Even a single use of a drug can cause severe harm to the human body. You can become addicted to any type of drug the first time you try it”; “Illegal drugs are often transported under the guise of ordinary food, medications, or other legal goods”; “Anyone can be found to be a drug trafficker by agreeing to transport a stranger’s luggage across the border if it is found to contain drugs.”
The key message on the magnet was a reminder of the harms of drug abuse.
The campaign was conducted under the Cross-Border Cooperation Project of Sub-programme 1 “Countering transnational organized crime, illicit drug trafficking and preventing terrorism” of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia 2022-2025. The project aims to enhance the capacity of border crossing points and improve regional cross-border cooperation by promoting Border Liaison Offices’ concept and developing information and communication networks for border agencies.
The project is funded by the Government of Japan.

30 June 2022
The Government of Tajikistan and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today presented the 2022-2027 State Programme on School Feeding Development in the Republic of Tajikistan. The presentation in Dushanbe was attended by representatives for the Government, UN agencies and the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
“Thanks to the support of the Government and continued funding from the Russian Federation, school feeding has become a flagship WFP programme in Tajikistan, contributing to the wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren across the country,” said Adham Musallam, WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan.
“By providing schoolchildren with healthy, nutritious school meals today, we not only help Tajik children grow and learn better, but also instill a life-long healthy eating habit that can be passed on to future generations,” he added.
School Feeding is WFP’s largest programme in Tajikistan, representing WFP’s decade-long commitment to Tajik children and their families. Since 1999, WFP has been partnering with the Government to implement school feeding in the country, and today some 440,000 schoolchildren in 2,000 schools across 52 districts and towns receive daily fresh meals under the programme. WFP has also supported the renovation and construction of school canteens, bakeries and greenhouses, and has provided expert support on the implementation of school meals.
The Russian Federation remains a key donor to the school feeding programme and to WFP’s work in the country, with more than US$ 80 million in funding provided to WFP since 2013.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Title: WFP supports Wheat Flour Fortification initiatives in Tajikistan

17 June 2022
DUSHANBE – Representatives from the Government of Tajikistan, wheat flour mills and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) gathered in the town of Guliston in Sughd Region for a roundtable meeting to discuss the implementation of the national fortification law signed in 2019 and to address the concerns and queries of the various stakeholders involved in wheat flour fortification in the country.
The roundtable, which was conducted with the support of WFP, was the beginning of discussions around food fortification issues, particularly wheat flour fortification in the country. For the first time, Tajik Wheat Flour Mill “Ordi Dushanbe” launched wheat flour fortification in May 2022 after installing necessary equipment and importing premix to the country.
“Micronutrient deficiencies in Tajikistan remain a public health problem with short-term and long-term effects, especially among women and children. Though improving the diversity of diets to include more vitamins and minerals is the best approach to reduce micronutrient malnutrition, food fortification is an immediate nutrition intervention. Reducing micronutrient deficiencies not only prevents anemia and other health problems, but also reduces the country’s healthcare expenditures and builds food security, “ said WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan Adham Musallam.
The Government of Tajikistan has identified food security and nutrition as one of the four strategic goals of the country in the National Development Strategy 2030. Tajikistan’s law on providing the population with fortified food determines the framework for prevention and for implementation of programmes to eliminate micronutrient deficiency and related diseases in Tajikistan.
Through its School Feeding Programme, WFP remains the only agency in the country to bring fortified food, especially fortified wheat flour and vegetable oil to the country and arrange hot meals for almost 440,000 primary grade schoolchildren in 2,000 schools across the country. WFP will provide technical support to the Government of Tajikistan to strengthen the health system and work with wheat flour mills and relevant ministries and departments on healthier behaviors.
Prior to the roundtable, WFP organised a field visit for participants to wheat flour mills in Sughd Region to get familiar with their work and identify gaps in the fortification of wheat flour.

Title: UNODC conducts in Dushanbe a regional workshop on visual stories for human rights advocacy
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 June 2022
Visual storytelling is a powerful tool in human rights advocacy to raise legal awareness and reduce the stigma and discrimination against people in prison, people who use drugs and people living with HIV.
On 16-18 May, UNODC conducted a regional workshop on visual stories for human rights advocacy for civil society, government and law enforcement professionals from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan who work with and provide legal assistance to people in prisons, people affected by HIV, and people who use drugs.
The workshop aimed to strengthen participants’ visual storytelling techniques, including the use of mobile photography and filmmaking technical skills for effectively imparting knowledge to a variety of target audiences.
“The workshop provides a unique opportunity for rights groups in Central Asia to share ideas, exchange best practices with like-minded practitioners, and foster critical thinking on pressing human rights and health issues amongst participants and with Picture People’s trainers,” said Mutabara Vohidova, National Project Officer, UNODC Programme Office in Tajikistan, in her opening remarks.
For three intense days, the participants learned to capture professional-quality photos and videos on their smartphones as well as use visuals ethically and effectively to develop a visual project to advocate issues related to HIV and drug use.
The workshop was delivered by Claudia Modonesi, Picture People* Chief Executive Officer, human rights expert and media trainer, and Nick Danziger, Picture People Director, photojournalist, filmmaker and author.
“We live in a visual era, where digital media and technology go hand in hand to give us the best visual experience within reach, whether it is on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. It is crucial for human rights defenders and advocates in Central Asia to make the best use of video and images to inform, denounce and raise awareness on human-interest stories that need to be seen and heard to influence social change,” said Claudia Modonesi.
“It was extremely rewarding to work with such a committed and engaged group of people from across the Central Asian region advocating for better health for people living with HIV,” she added.
Upon completion of the workshop, the participants were awarded certificates. They thanked the organizers and trainers and assessed the workshop very positively.
“Excellent emotional atmosphere, productive knowledge, practical sessions. The programme was very intensive, the trainers are high-caliber professionals! During the workshop, we learned how to visually communicate with the audience and convey information at the emotional level tailored to each case. We tried our hand at applying the acquired knowledge and skills in the development of visual projects in PechaKucha presentation format. We worked in teams and jointly chose the topic of the project. Lively discussions, development of presentations using videos and photos - where each team managed to demonstrate their vision on how to visually increase the effectiveness of their human rights activities. I will continue to study visual storytelling on my own and improve my skills acquired at this workshop,” said Valentina Mankieva from Kazakhstan.
“The workshop was held in an absolutely positive and friendly atmosphere. I participated in such an event for the first time. The trainers shared with us their extensive and valuable experience. For myself, I acquired the skills of visual advocacy centered on the human being. I thank the organizers and trainers, participants of the event for the opportunity to have such a theoretically and practically useful communication,” said Elena Hasanova, Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist from NGO SPIN Plus in Tajikistan.
“Visual storytelling is the leading trend today, so it is very important to have the skills to use it effectively in your work. The workshop was conducted at a high level. Presentations by trainers, practical exercises, creative atmosphere, communication with colleagues - everything was perfect. The trainers are not just cool pros, but very interesting people.  I thank UNODC for the excellent organization of the event, the trainers and all the participants!” highlighted Marina Maximova from Kazakhstan.
The workshop was conducted within Sub-programme 3 “Addressing drug use, increasing treatment of drug use disorders and preventing HIV/AIDS” of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia 2022-2025.
*Picture People is a UK not-for-profit organisation that trains and supports human rights activists and filmmakers to produce and use films to effectively expose human rights abuses, change public perceptions and influence change.

25 May 2022
Dushanbe, 25 May 2022 - The Seventh Annual Inter-Regional Meeting within the UNODC-WCO Global Container Control Programme (CCP) organized jointly by the Customs Service under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan and UNODC started today.
The event brought together the heads and authorized officials from customs authorities and other competent agencies of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as representatives from international partner organizations, the donor community and UNODC.
“Interagency cooperation and information exchange are one of the effective ways to increase the capacity of customs authorities in their work to identify high-risk containers. Together, we will create a mechanism in customs administration that will contribute to more effective container control. It will allow, in particular, to significantly enhance the effectiveness of the work in drug trafficking prevention and will contribute to the economic development of the countries participating in the CCP,” said Mr. Azim Tursunzoda, First Deputy Head of the Customs Service under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, in his welcome speech.
“Recent developments require law enforcement agencies across the region to pay greater attention to border security, cargo control and fostering collaboration to stop transnational crime. UNODC actively promotes and supports regional and inter-regional cross-border cooperation initiatives, including the CCP which represents an important element of the UNODC’s comprehensive strategic approach to preventing and countering transnational organized crime. The CCP is a crucial part of the UNODC’s border security initiatives in the region,” said Ms. Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia, in her opening remarks.
Ms. Ashita Mittal underscored that another important element in ensuring the success of law enforcement practice is the effective application of anti-corruption and integrity measures. She highlighted that UNODC stands committed to providing support to these efforts.
Mr. Tofik Murshudlu, the Head of Coordination, Border Management Branch, UNODC Headquarters, noted that “The CCP has a longstanding partnership with countries of Central Asia, Black Sea and Pakistan and established more than 30 Port Control Units and Air Cargo Control Units in the region. The programme continues to expand to additional sea, dry and airports benefitting from the results in terms of seizures of drugs and other illicit goods.”
He reiterated UNODC’s commitment to further support the Governments in their efforts towards enhancing border control, cross-border cooperation, data exchange, and joint operational activities on preventing and suppressing high-risk consignments through the CCP’s integrated strategic approach.
During a two-day event, participants will discuss the priorities, needs and challenges in cargo/container control, promotion of integrity in customs and strengthening inter-regional cooperation among customs and other competent authorities of the CCP participating countries in identifying high-risk cargo in the context of the current security situation in the region.
At the end of the meeting, a Joint Declaration of the heads and authorized officials from customs authorities and the CCP participating countries will be adopted.
The UNODC-WCO CCP was established as a joint initiative of the UNODC and the WCO in 2004. The mission of the CCP is to build capacity in the Member States seeking to improve risk management, supply chain security and trade facilitation in seaports, airports and land border crossings to prevent the cross-border movement of illicit goods.
The regional segments of the CCP for the Central Asian and Black Sea regions and Pakistan are funded by the Governments of Canada, Germany, Japan and the United States of America.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
17 May 2022
DUSHANBE, 17-18 May – Through financial support from the European Union, the city of Dushanbe and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) conducted two self-assessment workshops focused on disaster resilience. The Disaster Resilience Scorecards, tools of the global initiative Making Cities Resilient 2030 (MCR2030), were used at the workshops to provide a set of assessments that allow local governments to assess their disaster resilience, and identify gaps and strengths, laying the foundation for the local strategy development.
The assessments were conducted within the frames of the EU-funded “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia” initiative, as well as the membership of the city of Dushanbe in the MCR2030 initiative. The assessments are part of the longer-term process of disaster resilience assessments and local disaster resilience strategy development of the city of Dushanbe, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
The self-assessments are being carried out by the members of the Technical Working Group established by the city of Dushanbe, consisting of representatives of the local and national government. The workshops are hands-on exercises following an introductory meeting conducted earlier. The workshops were also attended by the EU Delegation to Tajikistan and UN partners.
In the first self-assessment workshop, participants worked on the “Preliminary Disaster Resilience Scorecard” assessment, aimed at establishing a baseline measurement of the city’s current level of disaster resilience as well as to increase awareness and understanding of resilience challenges across relevant stakeholders. The second workshop, conducted with the support of the World Health Organization, used the “Public Health System Resilience Scorecard”, aimed at strengthening the coverage of public health issues and consequences in disaster risk management.
The workshops successfully introduced participants to the foundations of local resilience building, and they were able to identify disaster resilience gaps and assess the current policy and practices for strengthening the city’s resilience.
The workshops were conducted at a pivotal time, just weeks before the Seventh Session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, the world’s foremost gathering on reducing disaster risk and building the resilience of communities and nations.
Mr. William Lindberg, Programme Manager of the Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Tajikistan, said: “Disaster Risk Management is an important part of the European Green Deal, the EU’s Strategy for Central Asia and the new Global Gateway strategy. Together with our Member States, we are providing a broad response to disasters, ranging from finance and medium and long term technical assistance and capacity building to partner country authorities, to short-term rapid response action to support humanitarian needs in the aftermath of natural disasters. We are fully committed to support Tajikistan to develop a robust DRM sector that is ready to meet potential future disasters, stemming not least from climate change.”
Mr. Sulaimon Shamsizoda, Head of the Department of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense in the city of Dushanbe, noted: “In recent years, the Republic of Tajikistan has worked to increase the country's capacity in the field of disaster risk management and to fulfill obligations under the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. As part of this process, Tajikistan has adopted a new disaster risk reduction strategy. In this regards, I would like to highlight that the Committee for Emergency Situations of Dushanbe is successfully carrying out different activities aiming to strengthen the city's resilience. We hope to continue our work on resilience-building with different partners in future.”
Mr. Abdurahim Muhidov highlighted that “the city of Dushanbe is developing very fast. It is very important to strengthen the city’s safety and environmental friendliness, and resilience to existing and emerging hazards, and to integrate these considerations into the city’s overall development plan. These preventive measures provide safe and comfortable conditions for the residents of the city and ensure the proper functioning of its infrastructure”.

Title: Our use of sand brings us “up against the wall”, says UNEP report
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
26 April 2022
Strategic recognition for sand and actions across sectors needed, report urges:
• Sand is the world’s second most exploited resource and must be wisely managed
• Legal changes, recycled building material, crushed rock and ‘ore-sand’ from mining, among solutions.


Geneva, 26 April 2022 – 50 billion tons: enough to build a wall 27 metres wide and 27 metres high around planet Earth. This is the volume of sand and gravel used each year, making it the second most used resource worldwide after water. Given our dependency on it, sand must be recognised as a strategic resource and its extraction and use needs to be rethought, finds a new report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
The report, Sand and Sustainability: 10 strategic recommendations to avert a crisis, released today by UNEP’s GRID-Geneva team, provides the necessary guidance gathered from world experts to switch to improved practices for the resource’s extraction and management.
Extracting sand where it plays an active role, such as rivers, and coastal or marine ecosystems, can lead to erosion, salination of aquifers, loss of protection against storm surges and impacts on biodiversity, which pose a threat to livelihoods through, among other things, water supply, food production, fisheries, or to the tourism industry.
According to the report’s authors, sand must be recognised as a strategic resource, not only as a material for construction, but also for its multiple roles in the environment. They stress that governments, industries and consumers should price sand in a way that recognises its true social and environmental value. For example, keeping sand on coasts may be the most cost-effective strategy for adapting to climate change due to how it protects against storm surges and impacts from sea level rise - such services should be factored into its value.
An international standard on how sand is extracted from the marine environment should also be developed, the report proposes. This could bring about dramatic improvements as most marine dredging is done through public tenders open to international companies. Meanwhile, the report recommends that the extraction of sand from beaches be banned due to its importance for coastal resilience, the environment and the economy.
“To achieve sustainable development, we need to drastically change the way we produce, build and consume products, infrastructures and services. Our sand resources are not infinite, and we need to use them wisely. If we can get a grip on how to manage the most extracted solid material in the world, we can avert a crisis and move toward a circular economy,” said Pascal Peduzzi, Director of GRID-Geneva at UNEP and overall programme coordinator for this report.
Infrastructure, homes, food and nature at stake
Sand is critical to economic development, needed to produce concrete and build vital infrastructure ranging from homes and roads to hospitals. By providing habitats and breeding grounds for diverse flora and fauna, sand also plays a vital function in supporting biodiversity, including marine plants that act as carbon sinks or filter water. The resource will be crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and tackling the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. However, it is being used faster than it can be naturally replenished, so its responsible management is crucial.
A circular economy is within reach
The authors note that solutions exist for moving towards a circular economy for sand, including  banning the landfilling of mineral waste and encouraging sand to be reused in public procurement contracts are among the policy measures cited. Crushed rock or recycled construction and demolition material, as well as ‘ore-sand’ from mine tailings are among the viable alternatives to sand that should also be incentivised, the report details.
They add that new institutional and legal structures are needed for sand to be more effectively governed and best practices shared and implemented. Sand resources must furthermore be mapped, monitored and reported on, the report recommends. Meanwhile, all stakeholders must be involved in decisions related to the management of sand to allow for place-based approaches and avoid one-size-fits-all solutions, the paper stresses.
The report follows a resolution on Mineral resource governance adopted at the fourth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) that called for actions on sustainable sand management. This mandate was confirmed at UNEA-5 in 2022 in the new resolution titled Environmental aspects of minerals and metals management, adopted by all member states.

Title: WHO urges accelerated action to protect human health and combat the climate crisis at a time of heightened conflict and fragility
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 April 2022
On this World Health Day (April 7, 2022), WHO is issuing an urgent call for accelerated action by leaders and all people to preserve and protect health and mitigate the climate crisis as part of an “Our planet, our health” campaign marking the organization’s founding day, which falls at a time of heightened conflict and fragility.
In issuing its call-to-action, WHO notes that 99 per cent of people breathe unhealthy air mainly resulting from burning of fossil fuels. A heating world is seeing mosquitos spread diseases further and faster than ever before. Extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, land degradation and water scarcity are displacing people and affecting their health. Pollution and plastics are found at the bottom of our deepest oceans, the highest mountains, and have made their way into our food chain and blood stream. Systems that produce highly processed, unhealthy foods and beverages are driving a wave of obesity, increasing cancer and heart disease while generating up to one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. This health and social crisis is compromising people’s ability to take control over their health and lives.
“The climate crisis is a health crisis: the same unsustainable choices that are killing our planet are killing people,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We need transformative solutions to wean the world off its addiction to fossil fuels, to reimagine economies and societies focused on well-being, and to safeguard the health of the planet on which human health depends.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fault lines of inequity across the world, underlining the urgency for creating sustainable, well-being societies which do not breach ecological limits and which ensure that all people have access to life-saving and life-enhancing tools, systems, policies and environments.
WHO’s Manifesto to ensure a healthy and green recovery from COVID-19 prescribes protecting and preserving nature as the source of human health; investing in essential services from water & sanitation to clean energy in healthcare facilities; ensuring a quick and healthy energy transition; promoting healthy and sustainable food systems; building healthy and livable cities; and stopping the use of taxpayers’ money to fund pollution.
The Geneva Charter for well-being highlights what global commitments are needed to achieve equitable health and social outcomes now and for future generations, without destroying the health of our planet.
Through its World Health Day campaign, WHO is calling on governments, organizations, corporations, and citizens to share actions they are taking to protect the planet and human health.

These partners will come together towards the end of the year to develop detailed joint workplans outlining the actions and initiatives needed to achieve the goals of the Cooperation Framework.
Mr. Ashurzoda noted: “Today’s event is an important milestone in completing the process of developing a new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2026. It should be noted that the new framework is closely linked to the goals of the National Development Strategy until 2030 and its medium-term program for 2021-2025 and reflects the key national priorities.”
“I would like to sincerely thank the Government of Tajikistan and all stakeholders present here today for the joint work. The new Cooperation Framework is a different paradigm and brings a full partnership, mutual accountability for results and reaching people in Tajikistan that are farthest behind.  We can only do this if we work fully together” noted  Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu in her opening remarks.
During the meeting the UN Country Team also presented the 2021 UN Annual Results Report . The report provided comprehensive information in all major areas of the UN’s work in the country and highlighted achievements in financing SDGs, joint actions for nutrition, gender-based violence prevention and UN’s COVID-19 response among others. Some of the results highlighted are the following:
The report will be available on the UN in Tajikistan web-site in English, Tajik and Russian shortly.
The United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is the most important instrument for planning and implementation of the UN development activities at country level. With its focus shifted from development assistance to development cooperation and integrated approach, the Cooperation Framework is in the center of UN reform. The goal of the UN Reform is to improve the coherence, accountability and effectiveness of the UN system to deliver better results for the people and support the Government of Tajikistan to achieve the goals and targets under the SDGs.

18 March 2022
18 March, Dushanbe - Concluding a two day visit to Tajikistan, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, called on the international community to redouble its support for Afghan refugees in Tajikistan and throughout the region.

In Dushanbe, Grandi was received by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon. They discussed the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and the international protection needs of asylum-seekers and refugees. Grandi commended the Government for its generosity in hosting refugees for almost three decades and called for expanded support for long staying and new Afghan refugees.
“Despite the many crises in the world, it is critical that the international community not neglect the needs of Afghan refugees, including here in Tajikistan,” he said.
The High Commissioner also met with the Ministers of Foreign and Internal Affairs. Grandi expressed his appreciation for their cooperation and underlined the important role Tajikistan plays in ensuring international protection for people forced to flee.
To this end, Grandi welcomed the resumption of the Government’s comprehensive registration of asylum seekers in order to determine their refugee status, and pledged UNHCR’s full support to the Government in this area.
In addition to the meetings with officials, Grandi visited the Balkhi refugee settlement near the Tajik-Afghan border in Khatlon province with the Chairman of the Committee for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense. The settlement was recently established by the Tajik authorities, with support of the international community, as part of its emergency preparedness measures, and is ready to receive any new asylum seekers from Afghanistan.
Grandi also met with the refugee community in Vahdat city, which hosts three quarters of refugees in the country. He learned about their experiences of living in Tajikistan, including the challenges that have emanated from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan.
“The Afghans I met today demonstrated the extraordinary potential of refugees. They were young, talented, and full of energy and drive. It is now up to the international community and the host Government to provide them with the space and the opportunity they need so that they can make the most of their potential,” said Grandi.
There are nearly 14,000 refugees and asylum-seekers living in Tajikistan.

15 March 2022
On 15 March, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan organized an online side event on the margins of the 65th session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs to present the “Review of the Situation on Narcotic Drugs in the Republic of Tajikistan for 2021”.
The event brought together representatives from UNODC, Drug Control Agency under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Central Asian countries, the diplomatic corps and international organizations accredited in Tajikistan, Embassy of Tajikistan in Austria, National Information and Analytical Center for Drug Control under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan, UNOV, UNAIDS, CSTO, CARICC, SCO, and others.
“I would like to emphasize the important role of Tajikistan in addressing the trafficking of drugs, especially because of its long border with Afghanistan - one of the largest opium poppy-growing countries. Tajikistan is an active contributor to the regional counternarcotics efforts and plays an important role in promoting drug control cooperation. The review of the situation on narcotic drugs in the Republic of Tajikistan for 2021 is one of the elements to contribute to information and knowledge exchange in the region, and we encourage our partners to continue their efforts in developing information and analysis materials,” said Ms. Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative for Central Asia, who moderated the event.
Major General of Justice Habibullo Vohidzoda, Director of the Drug Control Agency, made a presentation of the annual drug review for 2021. The policy of the Republic of Tajikistan in countering drug trafficking, efforts in the prevention of drug abuse and drug demand reduction, the counternarcotics activities of law enforcement agencies, relevant ministries and departments, public organizations, as well as related achievements and challenges were reflected in the review.
Habibullo Vohidzoda, in his speech, noted that the problem of drug trafficking and smuggling is transboundary in nature, and it requires, first of all, the strengthening of state borders. He called on donor countries and international organizations to provide financial, technical and logistical assistance to the authorized agencies of the Republic of Tajikistan in strengthening the Tajik-Afghan border, given the threats emanating from Afghanistan.
The presentation was followed by an exchange of views and questions and answers.

Title: Russia contributes US$ 2 Million to School Feeding in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 January 2022
News Release
DUSHANBE - The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) welcomes a contribution of US$ 2 million from the Russian Federation in support of the school feeding programme in Tajikistan.
“Caring for the younger generation of Tajikistan is one of our priorities. Russia has already allocated more than US$ 82 million towards school feeding in the country in the spirit of alliance and strategic partnership that have been linking our countries for 30 years,” said Minister-Counselor, Embassy of the Russian Federation to the Republic of Tajikistan, Shamil Foatovich Shamsutdinov.
“This contribution is very timely for Tajik schoolchildren. Thanks to the close partnership with the Government of Tajikistan and the continued support from the Russian Federation, WFP has been providing healthy, nutritious school meals to children through the school feeding programme, contributing to their growth and development,” said Adham Musallam, WFP Representative and Country Director. “WFP also provides technical support to the Ministry of Education and Science in the management and coordination of the school feeding programme throughout the country.”
The school feeding programme is WFP’s largest operation in Tajikistan, which has been funded by the Russian Federation since 2013.  Under this programme, nutritious meals are provided to schoolchildren in grades one to four across 2,000 schools in 52 districts and towns of the country. In 2021, with the financial support of the Russian Federation, the country’s schools received 7,000 tons of food to prepare school meals for some 440,000 schoolchildren.
The programme also contributes to the modernization of schools’ infrastructure. A total of 50 school canteens have been repaired and equipped with modern equipment, and nine greenhouses, five interschool bakeries and one food processing factory have been built. Additionally, eight private bakeries have been equipped, which also work with schools.
Since 2013, the Russian Federation has allocated US$ 82.1 million to WFP for the implementation of the school feeding programme, US$ 54 million of which has gone towards food assistance and US$ 28.1 million for school infrastructure modernization.

23 December 2021
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has supported the construction and rehabilitation of 70 houses damaged or destroyed by a magnitude 5.8 earthquake that struck Rasht Valley back in July.
“WFP is very pleased to be working with the Government and partners to help affected families recover. We tried our best to complete this project before the winter season arrives, and we managed to do just that. Seeing families already moving into new and warm homes is the best outcome we could ask for,” said Adham Musallam, WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan.
Through a three-month project, WFP worked closely with the Committee of Emergency Situation and Civil Defense under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan (CoES) and provided US$ 500,000 to cover the cost of the project. A tripartite agreement between CoES, WFP and a public organization Markazi Dastgirii Gharm was signed to facilitate the reconstruction activities and project coordination.
Over the past five years, WFP has been providing technical assistance, equipment, and trainings to CoES staff at the local and regional levels to help build disaster-resilient communities. In 2021, WFP assisted some 30,000 people through resilience-building projects, while strengthening national emergency preparedness and response capacities for the Government development partners.

Joining the global partnership allows governments, civil society organizations and others to strengthen partnership with various stakeholders to assess the situation of stigma and discrimination in the country, act and allocate resources and Monitor and report on the concrete steps taken to address HIV-related stigma and discrimination in the targeted settings.
Mr. Ziyovuddin Avgonov thanked the UN and partners for cooperation in fighting HIV/AIDS and mentioned following: “Without addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination, we won't achieve the goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.”
Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator noted: “Only together and only when we are speaking out on the harmful effect of stigma and discrimination on epidemic and the rights of people living with HIV, we can ensure negative effects of the epidemic are minimized. Tajikistan knows how to deal with HIV/AIDS. Let’s just join hands, ring the alarm bells and refocus our efforts to the new situation and stop this increase once and for all.”
The Global Partnership for Action to Eliminate All Forms of HIV Related Stigma and Discrimination was formed in 2017 to create an opportunity to harness the combined power of governments, civil society, bilateral and multilateral donors, academia and the United Nations to consign HIV-related stigma and discrimination to history.

DUSHANBE – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has started delivering food to Afghanistan from Tajikistan in support of the agency’s emergency response for Afghan families facing hunger this winter.
The first convoy of seven trucks left WFP warehouses in Dushanbe, heading to Afghanistan’s Badakhshan province in the northeast. Some 2,500 metric tons of wheat flour procured from the region will be delivered in the coming days and used by WFP Afghanistan in its lifesaving operations.
“Racing against time, WFP colleagues in Afghanistan need all the support we can provide to preposition food before snow cuts off roads, especially in the remote districts such as those in Badakhshan,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan Adham Musallam during a ceremony today to mark the departure of the aid, attended by representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Committee for Emergency Situation under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan.
“We thank the Government of Tajikistan for standing with the Afghan people at this critical juncture. The corridor is extremely timely in helping us bring food into Afghanistan through border crossings,” added Adham Musallam. He also thanked the Tajik Government for its support to the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) managed by WFP. Regular flights are now connecting Dushanbe with Kabul and other destinations in Afghanistan and is open to the entire humanitarian community.
Afghanistan is fast becoming the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. WFP has been ramping up lifesaving support, reaching 14.8 million people with food and nutrition assistance since the beginning of this year. However, the needs are immense. The agency needs US$220 million per month to reach 23 million people facing acute food insecurity in 2022.

Title: Government of Tajikistan, UN and EU officially launch the Spotlight Initiative programme and start the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 November 2021
Today, on International Day for the Elimination of Gender-Based Violence (GBV), the Government of Tajikistan, the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU) gathered to launch the ground-breaking Spotlight Initiative in Tajikistan which aims to end sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls. The event also launched the national 16 Days of Activism Against gender-based violence campaign, which this year marks its global 30th anniversary.
A wide range of stakeholders - government officials, UN agencies, EU representatives, donor community, national and international organizations,  civil society, media, youth groups and activists joined the event in solidarity to promote action on the issue of violence against women and girls.
Violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, is widespread around the world, and has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Tajikistan, according to the Government’s Demographic Health Survey data of 2017, 31% of ever-married women have experienced some form of gender-based violence.
Tajikistan is one of the 25 countries in the world and two countries in Central Asia where the government, the UN and the EU are partnering to increase financing and expertise through the Spotlight Initiative to end sexual and gender-based violence.
This year the Spotlight Initiative and the 16 Days of Activism campaign will work to raise awareness, facilitate dialogue, promote increased commitments and highlight joint progress on reducing gender-based violence.
Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan noted: “The Spotlight Initiative is a joint flagship programme of the EU and UN that aims to reverse the negative trends in violence against women and girls with serious investments and solutions. In the same time, it is a demonstration of the UN Development System reform in action on the Sustainable Development Goals, demonstrating that a significant, concerted, and comprehensive investment in gender equality and ending violence can make a transformative difference in the lives of women and girls and entire society.”
Ms. Petra Gašpárová, EU Deputy Ambassador to Tajikistan noted: “Spotlight Initiative promotes a society with no tolerance for gender-based violence. It’s a collective effort – in which the government, local governance bodies, international partners and the civil society together develop a capacity to better understand and effectively address violence against women and girls. In Tajikistan, the Spotlight Initiative provides a strong toolbox to act at all these levels. The global 16 Days of Activism campaign helps us bring this important issue in the spotlight, show solidarity with the survivors of domestic violence and create an environment in which it is safe to speak up and seek help, for the benefit of the thousands of girls and women who suffer in silence.”
Note: The Spotlight Initiative is a global, multi-year partnership between the EU and the UN to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. The overall vision of the Spotlight Initiative in Tajikistan which will be implemented by December 2022 is that women and girls enjoy their right to a life free of violence. The funding of 5 million euros for the programme in Tajikistan will contribute to the elimination of sexual and gender-based violence by responding to the needs of women and girls and addressing the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, as well as developing the capacity to prevent and effectively address domestic violence and other forms of abuse, using a multi-sectoral and intersectional approach.

Title: UNODC continues to strengthen capacities of the Drug Control Agency of Tajikistan’s cadre of instructors

19 November 2021
“I knew what pedagogy is, but I had no idea about andragogy [adult education]. I have attended many training courses, but this one was among the best. It not only reminded me of my previous trainer experience but also brought new ideas to the surface,” says General Sheravliyo Mirzoavliyoev, a participant of the training-of-trainers course conducted by UNODC within the framework of the “Tajikistan Drug Control Agency Establishing the Training Academy: Phase II” component.
“Drug Control Agency has a vision of creating a pool of trainers. Having senior experts sit together with the new generation is a great idea. We learned both about new training methods and techniques and shared our own experience in conducting trainings. Training-of-trainers course is an important step forward,” he adds.
The feedback received from other training participants is also very positive:
“I am working in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, and I will serve as a trainer there. I used to think that good training must be supported by high technology devices, but now I know that effective training first needs a well-developed structure with clear goals and objectives,” says Ms. Mohira Shirinova.
Ms. Mumtoz Loikzoda, with nine years of experience in the DCA notes: “I need to develop a separate lesson plan for each training topic to deliver sessions in a more productive way.”
UNODC continues to strengthen the capacities of the Drug Control Agency under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan (DCA) to better gauge and respond to threats of organized crime, including illicit drug trafficking, and ensure effective crime prevention. In this effort, the capacity-building of DCA officers forms a key component for effective and efficient law enforcement activities.
On 8-12 November, UNODC conducted a training-of-trainers (ToT) course for 20 DCA instructors, including three DCA Academic Training Unit staff and five DCA retired officers with extensive experience in delivering trainings.
The ToT courses aim to establish a national pool of law enforcement experts. The trained experts will support DCA with the development of training curriculum and deliver trainings for the staff, provide advice on the application of relevant tools, standards and norms, best practices in design, delivery and evaluation of training programmes. In addition, the ToT courses provide the staff with continuous learning and development opportunities.
Developed training materials included, among others, a training manual and audio-visual products translated into the Tajik language.
The ToT course was delivered by Mr. Mustafa Erten, the UNODC Head of Programme Office in Tajikistan.
The participants thanked organizers for providing them with such learning opportunities and highlighted that the course was very interactive and practical. The post-course assessment showed a 120% increase in knowledge.
The ToT course was organized within the framework of the “Tajikistan Drug Control Agency Establishing the Training Academy: Phase II” component of Sub-programme 1 “Countering transnational organized crime, illicit drug trafficking and preventing terrorism” of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia.
The component is funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).

Title: National Food Systems Pathway launched by Government of Tajikistan with support of United Nations
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
10 November 2021
The Committee for Food Security under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan and the United Nations (UN) hosted a high-level meeting to launch the National Food Systems Pathway with the participation of government, UN, development partners, civil society and the private sector.
The meeting was a follow-up to the global Food Systems Summit held in Rome in September 2021 where the UN Secretary-General called on countries to build sustainable food systems to accelerate progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that promote healthier, more sustainable and more equitable food systems.
Food security is one of the five key priorities of the National Development Strategy for Tajikistan, as despite improvement in the socioeconomic situation, every third household is considered moderately or severely food insecure, with most negative effect on children. Lack of nutritious food limits physical and cognitive development of children. And, as they grow up, it affects health and productivity as workers. Annually, malnutrition is estimated to cost countries significant economic losses.
Speaking at the launch, Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, the UN Resident Coordinator underlined the importance of food systems for the future development of Tajikistan: “Building sustainable food systems is key not only for promoting food security and nutrition, but also for green growth and jobs. We need to increase food production while also considering environment protection. With the same amount of land, more food can be grown using climate-smart agricultural practices. The UN in Tajikistan stands ready to support the implementation of the national food systems pathway to ensure everyone has safe and nutritious food.”
“Ensuring food security is one of top priorities of every state and nation, and constant efforts are being made in Tajikistan in this area as well. The purpose of the adoption and approval of this initiative is to improve food security and safety in the country. It will urge ministries and agencies to take the necessary measures to eradicate hunger, malnutrition and poverty” noted Fayzullozoda Muhammadsaid Ubaydullo, Chairperson of  the Committee for Food Security under the Government of Tajikistan.
Designed to address existing gaps and challenges to sustainable food systems in the country, the pathway cuts across all key dimensions: food production, processing, distribution, safety standards, sale, consumption, and nutrition. The objectives and activities of the pathway include: access to safe and nutritious food for all, sustainable use of natural resources, environment-friendly production, food consumption behavior, wellbeing and equity, and sustainability (rehabilitation/regeneration).

02 November 2021
Representatives of the Government of Tajikistan, the United Nations, private sector, development partners, academia and independent experts met to discuss the current state of development financing in Tajikistan, review financial mechanisms for the implementation of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and link these efforts to a focus on green recovery from COVID-19.
The workshop took place against the backdrop of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) this week in Glasgow, recognizing that Tajikistan will need innovative financing modalities to achieve these priorities. Partners exchanged knowledge and information and agreed to establish a network of experts to follow-up on the priorities for SDG financing in Tajikistan.
The workshop also provided an important opportunity for the members of the Financing NDS/SDG working group of the National Development Council under the President of Tajikistan to formulate priorities for the upcoming period and identify new partnerships for the financing agenda.
Ashurboy Solehzoda, First Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade stressed the need to accelerate resource mobilization and joint implementation of the NDS and the SDGs through the creation of an enabling environment for effective partnerships with all relevant actors.
Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator  highlighted that a wide range of financing options need to be considered to achieve the SDGs - public and private, domestic and international. She noted: “We face a triple planetary crisis- climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. Without radically changing the way we produce and consume things we are heading towards a precipice. That is why today’s topic is so important- it brings together two interrelated issues: how to promote green recovery and how we can find resources to finance this agenda. We have to act now.”
The workshop is a part of wider initiatives of the UN in Tajikistan on environment and green development and was organized jointly with the Ministry of Economic Development and by UN Economic and Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in collaboration with the UN in Tajikistan and a joint initiative on “SDG Financing in Tajikistan”, under implementation by UNICEF, UNDP and UN Women.

Title: WFP and Russia hand over fortified wheat flour and vegetable oil to Tajikistan for National School Feeding Programme
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
26 October 2021
DUSHANBE – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan handed over 1,485 tons of fortified wheat flour and around 61 tons of vegetable oil to the Ministry of Education and Science of Tajikistan during a ceremony this week. The food will cover the needs of the national School Feeding Programme in the Districts of the Republican Subordination (DRS), Khatlon Region, and the Gorno-Badakshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO).
The handover ceremony was attended by WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan Adham Musallam, Russian Ambassador to Tajikistan Igor Lyakin-Frolov and Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Tajikistan Sobirzoda Nurali Mirali.
The food assistance was purchased with funds from the Russian Federation, which allocated
US$5 million to improve food security in Tajikistan in 2021 as part of the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between WFP and EMERCOM of Russia. With this financial support, WFP has already delivered an additional 945 tons of fortified wheat flour and about 60 tons of vegetable oil to the town of Khujand for rural schools in Sughd Region.
“Since 2013, Russia has allocated more than US$80 million for the implementation of the School Feeding Programme in Tajikistan. Such an impressive amount is a clear confirmation of the strategic partnership and alliance that link Russia and Tajikistan," said Igor Lyakin-Frolov.
“Thanks to the support of the Russian Federation, WFP helps the young generation through school meals to reach their full potential,” said WFP Tajikistan Representative and Country Director Adham Musallam. “We are extremely grateful for Russia’s considerable and consistent support, which has proven crucial in assisting schoolchildren.”
The School Feeding Programme is WFP’s largest operation in Tajikistan, supporting 450,000 students with regular nutritious meals in grades 1-4 across 2,000 schools in 52 districts and towns. Along with food supplies to educational institutions, the programme also contributes to the modernization of the school feeding system in Tajikistan, including the renovation and construction of school canteens, bakeries and greenhouses, with expert support from the Russian Social and Industrial Foodservice Institute. The Russian Federation has allocated more than US$80 million to WFP for the implementation of the school feeding programme since 2013.
Russia is Tajikistan's strategic partner in the field of development and rendering humanitarian aid to the country.
In Tajikistan, WFP focuses on supporting development programmes that help strengthen institutional capacities. Since 1999, the organization has been partnering with the Government of Tajikistan to implement and manage school feeding in the country. This reflects WFP's strong commitment to changing the lives of the country's population for the better. Providing schoolchildren with healthy meals not only improves nutrition and overall health, but also increases access to and achievement in education.

Representatives of the Committee on Environmental Protection, Dushanbe Mayor’s Office, UN in Tajikistan, diplomatic corps and international community gathered today to plant trees in Javonon park in Dushanbe to jointly mark UN Day 2021 and advocate for climate action.
The tree planting event raised awareness of the triple planetary crisis to life on earth: climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution. All three trends negatively impact people’s wellbeing and sustainable development efforts.
Occurring on the eve of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland (COP26, 31 Oct-12 Nov 2021), statements by the UN, Mayor's Office and COEP drew attention to Tajikistan’s planned participation in the conference to raise awareness on environmental protection and advocate for sustainable solutions and future green development.
Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, opened the tree planting event by noting: “I believe every country and every individual has a responsibility on climate action. A healthy environment protects our biodiversity and food systems and reduces pollution and climate change. By coming together let’s reaffirm our commitment to a greener Dushanbe, a greener Tajikistan, and a greener and more peaceful world”.
United Nations Day (24 October) marks the anniversary of the day in 1945 when the United Nations Charter entered into force. UN Day, celebrated every year, offers the opportunity to amplify our common agenda and reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN Charter that have guided us for the past 76 years. As the world begins gradually to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, let us reinforce the call to strengthen international cooperation in the interest of both nations and peoples, building back together for peace and prosperity.

Title: National Workshop on SDG Financing in Tajikistan to discuss the innovative approaches in financing to achieve SDGs on the national level took place in Dushanbe
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 October 2021
The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan within the framework of the joint UN project "Financing Sustainable Development Goals in Tajikistan" run by UNICEF, UNDP and UN Women convened a two-day national workshop on ‘Securing Financing to Achieve SDGs in the Republic of Tajikistan’ at the National Library in Dushanbe on October 22-23, 2021.
The workshop was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education and Science, the State Committee for Investment and State Property Management, and other government officials at republican and sub-national levels. In addition, participation of the development partner community, civil society organizations, and representatives of state preschool and general secondary educational institutions is anticipated.
The workshop represents the first in the series of events within the framework of the joint programme ‘SDG Financing in Tajikistan’, which is co-financed by partner UN organizations and the UN Joint SDG Fund. The workshop is intended to institutionalize robust, inclusive and sustainable policy dialogue on SDG financing vis-à-vis achieving national policy priorities in the Republic of Tajikistan.
The joint programme specifically focuses on the education sector as the pilot and can demonstrate how new ways of facilitating and securing financing for SDGs can be explored and further replicated in other sectors. The workshop also represents an opportunity for the programme to marry technical inputs and deliverables with the national dialogue on the financing of medium- and long-term strategic policy priorities in Tajikistan.
“Financing of the education sector was never as important as now. The negative impact of COVID-19 is being experienced by all of us on all the levels. Thus, we very much welcome the inclusive dialogue with the participation of different stakeholders, such as private sector, civil society, and development partners to explore innovative approaches in budgeting and financing for the education sector and achievement of the SDGs”, underlined Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Republic of Tajikistan, Ms. Gulchehra Ganizoda.
The workshop will also be an opportunity for the programme team to present initial deliverables, such as the fiscal space assessments, the comprehensive review of financing bottlenecks and opportunities in the education sector, and the proposed mechanism (tool) to track and report on-budget public expenditures aligned with national SDG targets and indicators.
“We commit to implement the national strategies on achievement of SDGs in a better and efficient ways. We would like to thank our development partners for their substantial support and all the efforts in achieving our goals on the national level”- noted Deputy Minister of Economic Development, Mr. Ashurboy Solehzoda.
Inputs from these deliverables, as well as the anticipated discussion on the options to increase fiscal space, will feed into the development and finalization of the national SDG financing roadmap, which will subsequently be endorsed by the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, thereby providing the foundation for securing necessary SDG financing to implement the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for the period until 2030 and other sectoral strategies and programmes.
“The outcome of the workshop will feed into the finalization of the National SDG Financing Roadmap that will hopefully be endorsed by the Government of Tajikistan, and roadmap will be aligned to national development priorities and sector strategies.  ” – emphasized UN Women Country Program Manager Ms. Aziza Khamidova.

During the workshop, participants learned about methodology and process of the Disaster Risk Management System capacity assessment, applied it to their own context and made proposals for future capacity building.
In addition to the Capacity Assessment exercise, the workshop also discussed the achievements on disaster risk reduction. The draft of the DRR Regional Strategy for the Central Asia was featured alongside with the initial results of the online assessment of the DRR Strategy on Tajikistan. The program of the event included information on the activities on the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction in Tajikistan.
Mr. Jamshed Kamolov, the Head of the Main Department for Protection of Population and Territories of the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, stated: “the Republic of Tajikistan, within the framework of the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, which brings together relevant ministries and agencies of the country, as well as representatives of international organizations as observers, takes effective measures to ensure sustainable development based on the SFDRR priorities. Tajikistan is ready to strengthen international cooperation in the field of disaster risk reduction.”
Mr. Gieseppe Aristei, Representative of the European Union, noted: “The ability of a disaster risk management system to protect the population and the environment that surrounds us depends on the ability to adapt to the new challenges that the environment in which we live offers us. Over the years, the country has greatly strengthened its ability to deal with risk. The exercise proposed today is to further improve from where we are today.”
Mr. Abdurahim Muhidov, UNDRR Regional Programme Coordinator for Central Asia mentioned: “The national system of disaster risk management is an important step forward and next steps in multi-hazard approaches, investments and international cooperation are key, especially with the increasing impacts of climate change”.
Over the past years, the Republic of Tajikistan has undertaken efforts to strengthen the country's capacity in disaster risk management including a National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2019 and National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 October 2021
With the aim to ensure inclusive economic growth by supporting the most vulnerable families in rural areas of Tajikistan, the signing ceremony of the matching grant agreements and cash distribution took place today in Tajikistan’s western Yovon district. The initiative was supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the local authority of the district under a multi-country project, funded by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
In total, 51 successful matching grant winners from Dahana and Norin jamoats of Yovon district have received grants to realize their business plans. The investments will mostly support improved agricultural production, greenhouses for lemon and vegetables production, livestock production with a focus on sheep breeding and meat production, as well as poultry breeding.
A matching grant is a one-off, non-reimbursable transfer for a particular aim and on condition that the recipient makes a specified contribution for the same purpose.
224 business-applications have been screened by FAO, and district local authority and community members. With the support from specialists, farmers have further elaborated their business proposals based on pre-selected ideas.
“FAO developed and is now successfully scaling up the matching grant model to support agricultural development in Tajikistan,” said Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan. “The main goal of these projects is to improve production, nutrition, environment and life through investment into agriculture and agribusiness. This particular support is aimed at the vulnerable households who suffer from the impacts of COVID-19 and that of climate change. The financial mechanism used will help ensure sustainable income among low-income segments of the communities and growth of the rural economy, as they can stimulate market development and innovations.”
Now, beneficiaries will begin realizing their ideas. FAO, together with the local authority of Yovon district, will monitor the grants’ performance and support the entrepreneurs with technical advice.
This activity was carried out within the GEF-supported FAO project “Integrated natural resources management in drought-prone and salt-affected agricultural production landscapes in Central Asia and Turkey ('CACILM2'). The project aims to contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, promote sustainable land management and climate-smart agriculture practices, increase and improve provision of goods and services from agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a sustainable manner, reduce rural poverty, increase farmers’ capacity to cope with climate change caused challenges, as well as increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises.

Title: With Russian funding, WFP and Sughd authorities inaugurate new bakery in support of school feeding in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
29 September 2021
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the local authorities of Sughd Region inaugurated a bakery in the town of Isfara. This is the sixth such bakeries that WFP has renovated and built in the region with funding from the Russian Federation.
Representatives from WFP and the Russian Consulate in Sughd Region, along with officials of Sughd Region and Isfara town, participated in the inauguration ceremony. Freshly-made bread from these bakeries are now part of school meals that benefit more than 90,000 primary schoolchildren across 270 schools supported by WFP.
“Thanks to the financial support of the Russian Federation, and in partnership with the Russian Social and Industrial Foodservice Institute, we are able to carry out the bakery construction and renovation. Advanced technology and new equipment mean bread can now be made faster, cheaper and of better quality. Investments like these not only contribute to children’s health and development, but also provide more jobs for local communities whose lives have been impacted by the current socio-economic challenges in the country,” said WFP Representative, a.i., Hyun Ji (Angie) LEE.
Across the country, WFP has constructed and renovated a total of eight bakeries in partnership with the private sector, benefiting 114,000 primary schoolchildren in 340 schools. The bakeries are in Panj, Yovon districts in Khatlon Region, and Bobojon Ghafurov, Spitamen, Jabbor Rasulov, Devastich districts, and Istaravshan and Isfara towns in Sughd Region.
School feeding is WFP's largest operation in Tajikistan, supporting half a million young students in 2,000 schools across 52 rural districts and towns. For many vulnerable families and communities, healthy and nutritious school meals are often the only reliable source of food for their children. Evidence has shown that school meals contribute to better nutrition, improved health as well as increased access to education for children.
Since 1999, the World Food Programme has been collaborating with the Government of Tajikistan to improve the national school feeding system. This reflects WFP's strong commitment to changing the lives of the country's population for the better.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.  We are the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
28 September 2021
UNODC continues to strengthen the analytical capacities of the Tajik border officers to combat cross-border crime and ensure effective border control. Information processing and analysis form a key component for effective and efficient border management activities in this effort.
On 23-27 September, UNODC conducted a training course on the provision of informational and analytical support for management activities for twenty-five border officers from analytical divisions of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO).
In her opening address, Ms. Sita Farrell, Director, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Office at the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe, noted: “With the dynamic changes in the stability and security of neighboring countries, it is important that the border officers are equipped with required skills to prevent threats.  The goal of the training is to provide the necessary skills to Border Guards’ officers that will add value in enhancing their analytical skills and addressing the cross-border threats more efficiently.”
“I am confident that the training will enhance the efficiency of the border officers-analysts’ job,” noted Colonel Bakhtiyor Sobirov, Deputy Head of the Regional Department of the Border Troops in GBAO, in his opening speech. He expressed thanks on behalf of the management for the timely organization of this important training.
“The training is being conducted at an important time to strengthen the gathering and analysis of strategic and tactical intelligence concerning smuggling of illicit drugs and other contraband and assessing the threats posed on the border by organized crime. The competent and thorough analysis aids the agency to correctly deploy resources and be able to monitor certain border areas more effectively,” said Mr. Mustafa Erten, Head of the UNODC Programme Office in Tajikistan, in his opening remarks.
During the training, the participants learned about information security and protection of information, including protection of computerized information, analysis and assessment of the operating environment, creation of analytical maps by using geoinformation mapping, use of IBM i2 software for data processing and analysis, among others.
The training was delivered by national UNODC experts - border officers who completed the UNODC training-of-trainers courses.
Upon completion of the training, the participants were awarded certificates. They thanked UNODC for organizing the course and the trainers for their professionalism. They noted that such highly informative and useful trainings would enhance the efficiency of their day-to-day job.
The training was organized as part of the UNODC Initiative on Strengthening Control along the Tajik-Afghan Border under the UNODC Programme for Central Asia for 2015-2021. The initiative is focused to utilize the train-the-trainer approach to ensure the sustainability of intelligence collection methods and analytical capabilities. It is in line with the National Border Management Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2010-2025.
Since 2006, UNODC has constructed and rehabilitated eleven border posts and outposts on the Tajik-Afghan border, mainly at the Shurobod and Shahrituz stretches. Currently, UNODC is working on designing and projecting works for the construction of the strategic border outpost - Chaldovar at the Shahrituz stretch of the Tajik-Afghan border.
The outpost will be constructed for 75 border officers with their families. The project will also supply the site with furniture and equipment to provide the border officers with proper living and working conditions.
The initiative is funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).

Title: The rocky road to becoming a village expert vet
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 September 2021
Training opportunities for one person can ensure better chances for a whole.
20 September 2021, Dushanbe – Livestock plays a significant role in Tajikistan’s economic growth. Healthy livestock is also a driving force for sustainable production and food security and can contribute to better nutrition for millions of people in the country. This not only represents a source of high-quality food, but is a source of income for many smallholder farmers for purchasing food, as well as agricultural inputs, such as seed, fertilizers, and pesticides.

Without question, Amirkhon Nazirov truly loves animals and recognizes their value for Tajik rural families and society.
With 30 years of devoted work as a veterinarian, Amirkhon is now a senior vet at the veterinary station under the Committee for Food Security responsible for controlling animal diseases in Tajikistan’s Shamsiddini Shohin district.
His career path was rocky and challenging, yet his continuous wish to learn and develop brought him further. Earlier, he was selected to participate in training provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) that has helped him advance in his professional path.
“Through the opportunity to attend this course, I gained new knowledge and skills that advanced the service I’m delivering in this field,” stated Amirkhon. “This is very important to ensure the community’s recognition of the veterinary services’ value.”
Amirkhon lives in a mountainous area of Tajikistan neighboring Afghanistan, where most people are engaged in agriculture. He dreamed of becoming a vet since his childhood. After graduating from the veterinary college, Amirkhon joined his father, who worked as a horse herder at the Frunze state farm.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was finally assigned as a veterinarian to the same state farm. The large farm offered plenty of work for the young specialist, who had to treat all types of livestock, including horses, cows, goats, and sheep, and, on some days, even travel far, and deal with difficult cases. But he never gave up and tried everything to save the animals.
Amirkhon further developed his knowledge in 2019 through a comprehensive 10-day veterinary course offered by FAO in close cooperation with the Tajik Veterinary Association as a part of an European Union funded FAO project.
The training courses composed of theoretical and practical parts taking place in clinics and on farms. Along with 157 veterinarians, Amirkhon gained the skills and expertise needed for preventing, detecting, and responding rapidly and effectively to animal diseases. In addition, upon completion of the courses, the vets received veterinary tools and special clothing to help their work with rural communities.
“The courses played a crucial role in skilling vet specialists; the experts of the Veterinary Association were very knowledgeable and experienced,” added Amirkhon. “I really needed such courses to improve my knowledge and become more confident. In the past, due to the lack of knowledge and skills, we encountered serious challenges in treating livestock. I learned to do caesarean operations on animals when they have difficulty delivering, which is very important to save their lives. I am better able to manage the treatment of livestock and pets, in particular when they have flu, colitis, gastritis, scabies, etc. Nowadays, people have higher expectations in terms of the quality of veterinary services ensuring animal welfare and food safety.”
Devoted to continuous learning
For Amirkhon, it was not the first encounter with FAO. He also participated in FAO’s brucellosis control programme in Tajikistan that ran between 2003 and 2013. It was one of the most successful in Central Asia, and 642 veterinarians and local communities benefitted from this.
The programme helped advance practical knowledge and experience on preventing and treating brucellosis, and tackling the threat for both animal health and public health. FAO promoted gaining practical experience in laboratory diagnostics and surveillance, and supported the development and implementation of sound strategies for sustainable control programmes against brucellosis in livestock.
“I believe that prevention is much better than the cure,” remembered Amirkhon. “To limit the spread of the brucellosis within and among flocks and herds, we used long-term vaccination as the main preventative tool. Thus, we could minimize the negative impact of this disease on human health and the livestock on which households depend for income and food security.”
“Vets are fully dedicated to protect animals’ health and well-being and also humans’, very much linked to this,” says Amirkhon Nazirov. “Of course, differences exist between these two types of patients and options for treatment; however, we still have common interests and shared challenges. That is why there should be a strong collaboration between human and veterinary medicine to solve public health problem overall.”
There is a famous quote attributed to Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov: The medicine cures a human, and the veterinary medicine cures the whole humanity. Amirkhon made this quote his motto and lives up to this.
Activities related to improving veterinary services are part of the project “Strengthening institutions and capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and State Veterinary Inspection Service for policy formulation,” funded by the European Union. The main objective of this project is to assist the Government of Tajikistan in institutional reforms of their agricultural sector, including food security and safety.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 August 2021
UN and the Government of Tajikistan launched the new joint initiative aiming at empowering families left behind for improved migration outcomes in Khatlon, Tajikistan.
The initiative designed to support the implementation of the Global Compact on Migration was launched during the kick-off meeting with participation of the Ministry of Labor, Migration and Employment of Population of the Republic of Tajikistan, UN agencies and partners. The initiative funded by Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund will be executed by four UN Agencies: IOM, UNICEF, UN Women and UN FAO, with IOM taking a role of convening agency.
The opening event brought together 52 representatives from government and non-government agencies, including UN and civil society organizations, donor agencies, MPTF, INGOs, research institutions and other involved parties.
The initiative framed within the wider UN cooperation framework in Tajikistan, utilizes a multi-sectoral approach to the vulnerabilities of families left behind in Kulob and Dusti districts, with focus on the well-being, economic situation and rights of families left behind and strong gender component. Participants of the event emphasized the importance of this project to respond to multidimensional problems of families left behind and providing them with support they need to overcome the problems they face due to migration of their family members.
The Migration MPTF is the only UN financing mechanism fully dedicated to supporting joint initiatives of Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders in the national implementation of the Global Compact. Tajikistan is among the first six countries where joint initiatives were supported in October 2020, among South Africa, Philippines, North Macedonia, Chile and Mexico.

Title: FAO delivers seeds to flood-affected farmers in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
18 August 2021
18 August 2021, Dushanbe – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in close cooperation with Tajikistan’s Ministry of Agriculture, provided seeds of white bean, mung bean, maize, carrot, and cucumber to flood-affected farmers in the south-western part of the country.
This critical livelihood support aims at safeguarding the incomes of vulnerable rural households to ensure the immediate restoration of agriculture production affected by the 2021 floods and mudflows. With FAO's emergency support, those affected can have the means and capacity to produce the food needed, secure some income from the second harvest season, and build resilience against future shocks.
The initiative reached more than 787 households and around 312 dekhkan (individual or family) farms, cultivating 850 ha of arable land in Kulob, Vakhsh, and A. Jomi districts of the Khatlon region.
Starting from March 2021, the country was hit by a number of extreme weather events, including sharp fluctuations of temperatures, heatwaves, and frost during the spring, resulting in the full or partial loss of productivity of early vegetables and fruit trees.
In addition, in the beginning of May, a series of floods and mudflows destroyed croplands, pastures, and livestock, and damaged houses and other facilities, severely affecting the most populated districts of the Khatlon and Sughd regions.
“Immediately after the disasters hit Khatlon, FAO, jointly with other UN agencies, launched missions to assess the situation and define the most vulnerable members within the rural communities who has lost their harvests,” explained Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan. “In Tajikistan, many rural families depend on agriculture for their food and livelihoods. Therefore, FAO aims to reach out to the vulnerable population and will continue helping the most vulnerable people and families to recover their livelihoods.”
“The flood devastated our livelihoods and completely washed away our crops. Due to the lack of resources, we could not afford purchasing vegetable and legume seeds to plant for the second time,” said Sarvarbi Sharipova, a female farmer from Ziraki village, Ziraki jamoat, Kulob city. “I am very grateful to FAO for providing us high quality seeds.”
In recent years, more nature-induced disasters are affecting rural areas and livelihoods, and damaging the infrastructure. The country is vulnerable to climate change and environmental catastrophes, such as floods and mudflows that are increasing in frequency.
The flood and mudflow this spring damaged around 6 188 ha of arable land, livestock, and other infrastructure, as well as washed away household belongings.
This activity is part of the project on emergency preparedness and response to multiple crises in Tajikistan, funded by the FAO Technical Cooperation Programme. It aims to secure livelihoods, and feed and provide food security for the population.

Title: Dushanbe, the capital city of Tajikistan, launches development of the City Resilience Strategy and Action Plan that will include pandemics and biological hazards
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
13 August 2021
DUSHANBE – On 11-12 August, the City of Dushanbe in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia (UNDRR ROECA), conducted the first Self-Assessment Workshop on city's resilience to disasters using “Public Health System Resilience Scorecard” and “Preliminary Disaster Resilience Scorecard”.
This work is part of the “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia” initiative, implemented by UNDRR ROECA with funding from the European Union.
The workshop took place just as the city of Dushanbe officially joined the Making Cities Resilient 2030 (MCR2030) initiative and expressed its commitment to disaster risk reduction and building resilience. Being part of this initiative will allow Dushanbe to increase local resilience through advocacy, the exchange of knowledge and experiences, and the establishment of learning networks between cities to achieve the goals established in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sendai Framework 2015-2030.
The Technical Working Group established by the Executive Body of State Power in the City of Dushanbe and composed of over 40 representatives of the local and national government as well as risk analysis institutions, aims to develop by August 2022 the City Strategy and Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction for Dushanbe. The Strategy and Action Plan will be based on multi-hazard approach, addressing amongst other pandemics and biological hazards. Experience from past epidemics and the current COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the importance of coordination and cooperation between disaster managers, health workers and other sectors.
Mr. Amirkhon Kurbonzoda, First Deputy Mayor, stressed: “The intention of Dushanbe to join the Global Initiative for Making Cities Resilient 2030, is to assess the resilience of Dushanbe to disasters and develop a draft Strategy and Action Plan for Strengthening the City's Resilience to Disasters. By joining the global network of global cities, the City of Dushanbe has demonstrated its commitment to take action to ensure the safety and well-being of citizens during disasters and crises.”
Mr. Octavian Bivol, ROECA Chief, said: “I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the strong collaboration between UNDRR and the Government of Tajikistan. UNDRR’s support to Dushanbe for the development of a local resilience strategy and action plan constitutes a first concrete step in Dushanbe’s membership of the Making Cities Resilient 2030 initiative and is made possible through the initiative "Strengthening Disaster Resilience and Accelerating the Implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia", funded by the European Union.”
Mr. Giuseppe Aristei, representative of the European Union, noted: “Our focus today is improving city resilience, which means for a City to enhance its ability to bounce back and grow even stronger and better in the face of the chronic stresses and acute shocks associated with natural and man-made hazards. To this end we will have the opportunity to discuss about the initiative ‘Making Cities Resilient 2030’ and other useful tools and proposals for a better preparedness and for guiding cities on how to improve resilience overtime.”
UNDRR has called on national and local disaster management agencies globally to include health emergencies in the discussion on disasters, as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards.
Tajikistan is prone to many types of hazards, including avalanches, droughts, earthquakes, epidemics, floods, heat waves, insect infestation, landslides, mudflows and windstorms.

30 July 2021
On 23-27 July, UNODC conducted a training course on the provision of informational and analytical support in management for twenty-five mid- and senior-level border officers from analytical divisions of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan in the Khatlon Region.
The training aimed to further strengthen the analytical capacity of the border officers to develop the workflow of information processing on the Tajik-Afghan border.
In her opening address, Ms. Sita Farrell, Director, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Office at the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe, noted: “The goal of the training is to improve the Border Troops’ capacity through enhancing its officers’ analytical skills in more efficiently addressing the cross-border threats that include smuggling of drugs, goods, and people. The U.S. government once again reaffirms its commitment to helping Tajikistan secure its borders from external threats.”
“The training is very relevant for us considering the recent developments on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The knowledge acquired by the trainees will be systematized and applied by them in their day-to-day job,” highlighted Colonel Nazarmamad Gulmamadov, Chief of Staff of the Regional Department of the Border Troops in the Khatlon Region, in his opening speech.
“The training focuses on gathering, strategic and tactical analysis of intelligence concerning smuggling illicit drugs and other contraband and assessing the threats posed by organized crime. The competent and thorough analysis aids the agency to correctly deploy resources and be able to monitor certain border areas more effectively. The training will contribute to the enhancement of the informational and analytical system of management bodies, units and divisions of the Border Troops of Tajikistan,” said Mr. Mustafa Erten, Head of UNODC Programme Office in Tajikistan, in his opening remarks.
Upon completion of the training, the participants were awarded certificates. They noted that the training was highly informative and relevant and such trainings would enhance the efficiency of their job.
“I would like to thank the organizers of this training for providing us with the opportunity to gain new knowledge and skills required for our activities and trainers for their professionalism. The training programme was comprehensive, to the point and delivered in an accessible form,” noted S. Safarov, a border officer.
The training was organized as part of the UNODC Initiative on Strengthening Control along the Tajik-Afghan Border under the UNODC Regional Programme for Central Asia for 2015-2021. The initiative is focused to utilize the train-the-trainer approach to ensure the sustainability of intelligence collection methods and analytical capabilities. It is in line with the National Border Management Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2010-2025.

Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 July 2021
DUSHANBE – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Ministry of Education and Science of Tajikistan signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the development of a sustainable National School Feeding Programme.

“With this MoU – the first between WFP and the Ministry – we are pledging our commitment to improving the lives and creating a better future for the children of Tajikistan by investing in school feeding. We will work together towards the transition of the current programme to be government-owned from 2021 to 2027,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Tajikistan Adham Musallam.
School feeding is among the priority areas of the National Development Strategy 2016-2030, National Strategy for Education Development 2021-2030 and its Mid-term Action Plan 2021-2023. Its institutionalization is particularly set forth in the National Strategy for Sustainable Development of the School Feeding in Tajikistan up till 2027.
The School Feeding Programme is WFP’s largest operation in Tajikistan. Since 1999, the organization has been partnering with the Government to implement and manage school feeding across the country. In vulnerable and food insecure communities, providing healthy food to children at school means better nutrition, improved health as well as increased access to education.
Currently, around 430,000 Tajik schoolchildren from grades 1 to 4 in 2,000 schools of 52 rural districts are served hot, nutritious soup or other local meals. Traditional bread baked using staple food commodities provided by WFP is also included. With the support of the Russian Federation, WFP also works on the renovation of school canteens, bakeries, and continued training of school staff on healthy diets.

Title: United Nations and the Government of Tajikistan discussed the Roadmap for preparation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2023-2026
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
15 July 2021
On 15 July 2021, the UN in Tajikistan, with support and collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, discussed with a range of government and non-government partners the roadmap for preparation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2026 (UNSDCF). The hybrid event convened senior representatives of key ministries and state agencies, civil society organizations, private sector and the United Nations Country Team.
The new Cooperation Framework for 2023-2026 will significantly contribute to the implementation of Tajikistan’s development priorities reflected in the National Development Strategy 2016-2030 and aligned with the SDGs 2030. The Cooperation Framework is the new partnership platform designed to convene all national and international partners in a dialogue on national development priorities and achieve the objectives of the UN Reform process in contributing towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
The roadmap provides an overview of the milestones and timeline for the development of the new UNSDCF, including the strategic prioritization approach, the broad and inclusive consultation process and the final validation by stakeholders.
Mr. Muzaffar Huseynzoda, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in his opening remarks particularly mentioned the strong and strategic cooperation of the Government of Tajikistan and the UN system in Tajikistan and expressed their full support of the new Cooperation Framework as an integral component of the UN Reform process.
Effective coordination and active participation of state bodies, civil society organizations, private sector and international partners during the entire process of preparation and its implementation was underlined by Mr. Ashurboy Solehzoda, First Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade.
Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan noted that the UNSCDF process is a key component and outcome of the UN Reform and differs from the previous strategic planning approach. It will serve as a partnership platform, including for strengthening development financing, bringing in non-traditional partners, increase flexibility and streamline the process and promote the active involvement of all partners.
The round table provided an opportunity for participants to better understand the UNSDCF formulation process as well as the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders. The UNSDCF roadmap was officially presented to all parties securing the way for further successful preparatory work towards the design of the UNSDCF for Tajikistan for 2023-2026.

Title: Birthrates took another dip after COVID-19 hit. But it’s time to stop worrying about numbers
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
11 July 2021
The focus on birthrates misses the point, writes Alanna Armitage on today’s World Population Day. What matters is shaping countries in a way that people want to live and have families in them.
The COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated, at least temporarily, the global trend towards lower fertility rates. It’s normal for birthrates to fluctuate from one month to the other, but a look at the statistics shows a sharp decline in the number of births in many European countries in late 2020 – nine month after the first lockdowns kicked in.
Emerging news about the COVID-19 “baby bust” have fueled anxiety about countries’ demographic futures. The pandemic, and its impact on people’s reproductive choices, hit at a time when fertility rates were already very low across Europe. In Eastern Europe, mass outmigration had added to the problem: people don’t only have fewer children, they had also left their home countries in droves in search for better opportunities elsewhere. As a result, populations had been shrinking; countries like Bulgaria or Latvia had lost a quarter of their population since the 1990s.
We don’t know if birthrates will rebound after the pandemic. Historically, this was generally the case after dips in fertility rates during major crises. Data compiled by Tomas Sobotka, a leading demographer, shows that in the last few months birthrates in Europe have indeed shown signs of recovery. Much depends on how lasting the pandemic’s social and economic impact will be.
But the focus on birthrates misses the larger point. Rather than worrying about the ups and downs of population numbers, it is time to wake up to the reality that low fertility is very likely here to stay. And we must come to grips with what needs to be done to prepare our economies and societies for this all but inevitable demographic future.
This is not an easy shift. Common wisdom has it that high birthrates and population growth are desirable for countries, signs of national wealth and power. We are used to thinking in these categories. And it is true that economies may shrink, in absolute terms, when populations become smaller.
But this does not mean that people will become poorer. In fact, per capita prosperity might well go up as workforces are getting smaller, salaries are likely to rise, and increasing automation will lift productivity. Smaller populations are also good for the planet, as fewer people means less consumption, less pressure on scarce resources and less pollution.
To be sure, the transition from population growth to population decrease can be challenging, as many countries, especially in Eastern Europe, can testify. Societies are ageing rapidly and fewer working-age people have to provide for an ever-increasing number of older people. Rural areas are depopulating as people find better opportunities in bigger cities or abroad. Social systems are coming under pressure and it is costly to maintain infrastructure and services in sparsely populated regions.
But these challenges are manageable. Not only that: the need to address them opens up opportunities for innovation that can catapult countries into a more prosperous future. Places like Cluj in Romania or Belgrade in Serbia have emerged as major hubs for the tech industry, attracting talent from within the country and even from abroad. Across Eastern Europe, migrants have returned home due to the pandemic, bringing with them valuable skills, knowhow and networks. Governments are experimenting with ways to harness the key contribution of older people and better integrate them in the economy and society, and open up labor markets, and public life more broadly, to women, minorities and other marginalized groups, tapping into hitherto under-used resources. There even is talk about immigration, long a taboo topic in much of Eastern Europe. All of this contributes to making countries’ stronger in tackling demographic challenges.
Does this mean birthrates do not matter at all? Not quite. They do matter in that they tell a story of denied reproductive rights. People across Europe generally say they want two children, but many end up having one or none at all. This gap between desired and actual fertility is what governments should focus on – not with the intention to boost population numbers, but to help people realize their reproductive rights and be able to have the number of children they want.
This requires removing the many barriers people face when starting a family: economic uncertainties, high cost of housing, growing infertility, lack of affordable childcare and the expectation for women to compromise on their careers and shoulder the burden of care alone.
Progress on creating more family-friendly societies with more equal opportunities for women and men may well lead to higher birthrates, as people will feel more confident in starting a family and having the number of children they want. But neither is this guaranteed, as the example of falling birthrates in family-friendly Scandinavia shows, nor is it what should motivate the push towards family-friendly policies. The measures needed to make sure people can have the number of children they wish have value in themselves, improving people’s well-being and vastly upgrading countries’ development potential.
At UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, we understand the importance of demographic shifts for shaping countries’ futures, and we are supporting countries in strengthening their demographic resilience and in making the most of the opportunities they have.
The sooner we acknowledge that the solution to Europe’s demographic woes does not lie in increasing birthrates, the sooner we will be able to widen our focus to what really matters in addressing the continent’s perceived population crisis: our ability to create countries that people want to live and have families in.

Title: Experts from Tajikistan strengthen disaster reporting
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
08 July 2021
DUSHANBE– On 7-8 July 2021, experts from Tajikistan participated in the second part of the National training on the “DesInventar-Sendai” – a disaster information management software.
The main objective of the training was to strengthen relative capacities of authorities responsible for disaster risk management, including technical staff in use of the analysis module of the DesInventar -Sendai system. During the workshop, experts identified the progress and necessary steps to implement the system in the country. In addition, participants also reviewed the status of the reporting to Sendai Framework Monitor and discussed the existing national system for collecting and analysing data on disaster losses and the DesInventar-Sendai system. They compared technical features of the systems in the context of alignment with the Sendai Framework Monitor.
The “DesInventar-Sendai” system supports a dialogue on risk management and disaster risk reduction planning between all stakeholders from local to regional levels. This is especially important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic which has demonstrated the need to accelerate action on disaster risk reduction and to strengthen information management and exchange. The system allows to analyse disaster trends and impacts through a large range of sectoral and socio-economical dimensions. It is expected the implementation of the “DesInventar-Sendai” system software will help Tajikistan to develop sustainable disaster information management system aligned with the Sendai Framework monitoring process.
The training brought together experts from Committee for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense, Agency on Statistics, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Committee for Environmental Protection and Agency for Hydrometeorology.
The workshop was organized by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), in collaboration with CIMA Research Foundation and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), with the support of the European Union. The event took place within the framework of the “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia” initiative, funded by the European Union.
Background information
The EU-funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing the Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, development of regional DRR strategy, national disaster loss accounting systems, and community level disaster risk reduction. On the local level, the project supports development of disaster resilience strategies of capital cities. For this project, the EU committed EUR 3,750,000 for the three-year implementation.

Title: New equipment to tackle scourge of locusts in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
07 July 2021
7 July 2021, Dushanbe – Locust infestations are severely threatening Tajikistan’s agriculture. Led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), a wider effort delivered tires for various vehicles used in locust operations as well electronic gadgets, to support locust management in Tajikistan.
Using FAO’s own sources through a Technical Cooperation Programme, the emergency preparedness and response project aims to secure livelihoods, feed and food security of the populations living in the infested areas, including improved locust control through modern equipment, effective techniques, and proven solutions to control the locusts in Tajikistan.
Locust outbreaks and upsurges, particularly in Khatlon and Sughd provinces and Districts of Republican Subordination, are very destructive as locusts attack pastures and a wide range of crops. The livelihoods and food security of farmers in these regions, as well as in neighbouring areas, suffer greatly from crops and pasture damages caused by locust swarms.
The tires for tractors, all-terrain vehicles with sprayers, and for motorbikes will be used by the State Entity "Locust Control Expedition" of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Earlier, locust and agriculture specialists in the locust-affected areas have participated in trainings and workshops on locust monitoring and response in the framework of this FAO project. Appropriate locust monitoring entails improved early warning and response mechanisms to locust outbreaks, as well as establishing proper and timely control operations, leading ultimately better protection of crops and pastures.
“Locust populations still remain in the affected districts, especially in remote, hard-to-reach areas where surveillance or control operations are difficult,” said Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan. “It is crucial to maintain and increase control efforts using ground survey and control teams, as well as reporting that enables data to be recorded and transmitted to the national locust center. The project is aimed at the ensuring the relevant capacity of responsible agency for monitoring, early warning and timely response. As locust outbreaks will continue threaten the country’s agricultural sector and rural livelihoods, support should continue as well.”
Further assistance to the State Entity "Locust Control Expedition" in the form of technical knowledge and skills, as well as equipment to control locust infestations is granted by a regional FAO project strengthening regional coordination and efforts against locust implemented in six Central Asian countries with financial support from the Japanese government.
Tajikistan’s goal with its preventive locust control strategy is to reduce the number of infested and treated hectares, and the negative impacts of control operations on human health and the environment, and also to protect the food security and livelihoods of highly vulnerable rural communities.

The first goal of the joint project was to ensure the supply and availability of modern contraceptive methods at all levels. UNFPA, in cooperation with the MoHSPP of Tajikistan completed the procurement of contraceptives based on a multi-year procurement forecast. Moreover, with the support of the Government of Japan and in order to expand the choice of the population in contraception, new types of contraception were purchased, including subcutaneous implants, injectable and oral methods of contraception and the number of contraceptives were increased from 5 to 8 types.”
Project results and achievements: Сontribution of the Government of Tajikistan for the procurement of contraceptives increased from $20,000 in 2017 to $90,000 in 2020.  The State RH Programme for 2019-2022 is developed and under implementation.  Five types of contraception purchased according to the country's annual requirement. Three new types of contraception purchased in 2020, such as injectable, oral and subcutaneous. 110 midwives from the most remote Health Houses of Khatlon, Sughd regions and Districts of Republican Subordination certified in provision of quality IUD insertion and removal services and provided with insertion and removal kits. To date, more than 5000 successful IUD insertions/removal registered by RH services.  953297 family planning users have access to the currently available five modern methods of contraception. The increase in the number of more than 50,000 new users confirmed by the MoHSPP statistics.

Title: UNODC trained Tajik mid-level law enforcement officers on modern control techniques for vehicles, cargo and goods inspection
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 June 2021
On 21-25 June, UNODC conducted a training course on modern control techniques for vehicles, cargo and goods inspection in Dushanbe for mid-level officers from the Border Troops, Customs Service, Drug Control Agency and Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan working at the road and rail border crossing points in Tajikistan.
The training aimed to enhance the knowledge and skills of the officers to effectively respond to challenges during an inspection at checkpoints and strengthen their capacity to combat cross-border crime.
The training provided both theoretical and practical sessions. It was delivered by Mr. Lauris Krivans, the customs expert from Latvia who has extensive experience in conducting search operations and training customs officers.
During the training, the participants learned about advanced cross-border vehicle inspection procedures and control techniques, including inspection of cargo and trains, risk analysis and assessment, profiling, operational psychological assessment, among others.
In the course of the practical sessions, the participants strengthened their skills in the use of endoscopes, videoscopes, density meters, laser distance meters and telescopic mirrors.
The feedback received from the participants at the end of the training was very positive. They thanked UNODC for organizing the training and requested to conduct similar highly informative and useful courses in the future.
The training was conducted within the framework of Cross-Border Cooperation Component of Sub-programme 1 “Countering transnational organized crime, illicit drug trafficking and preventing terrorism” of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia designed to counter the trafficking of Afghan opiates through the northern route by establishing Border Liaison Offices (BLOs) at the key border crossing points (BCPs) in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan. It is the first project to establish BLOs in Central Asia, and its stakeholders are the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Border Troops, Customs and Drug Control Agencies of each country.
The establishment of BLOs in Central Asia builds a strong foundation for further effective interagency and cross-border cooperation. To date, 19 BLOs have been established on the Tajik-Afghan, Uzbek-Afghan, Tajik-Uzbek, Kyrgyz-Tajik, Kyrgyz-Uzbek, Kyrgyz-Kazakh and Kazakh-Uzbek borders. Each country assigned staff for the establishment of BLOs and allocated premises at the BCPs, while technical assistance was provided by UNODC ROCA through organizing training courses and providing equipment to support the operation of the offices.
The component is funded by the Government of Japan.

Title: On World Refugee Day, UNHCR promotes the inclusion of refugees in health, education and sports in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 June 2021
On 20 June, World Refugee Day, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, acknowledges the efforts of Tajikistan including refugees in health systems, education, and sports, supporting their integration into the local communities.
As of the end of 2020, Tajikistan hosts 5,989 refugees and asylum seekers. Most but not all have access to medical care, including COVID-19 vaccination, education, and work. UNHCR will continue supporting authorities and other partners to achieve greater inclusion of all refugees in healthcare, education, employment, and social protection to fully contribute to their host communities' development.
"During the pandemic, despite the challenges they face every day, refugees in Tajikistan have stepped up, working as doctors, nurses, teachers, and keeping their communities functioning. We have been inspired by cooperation between refugees and members of their host communities in Tajikistan," said Mulugeta Zewdie, UNHCR Representative in Tajikistan.
Despite the pandemic, the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people, according to UNHCR's latest annual Global Trends reports released on 18 June. This is a further four percent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019.
World Refugee Day is an opportunity to acknowledge the experiences of the millions of people forced to flee violence and persecution. But it is also a day to celebrate the fact that, with help from welcoming communities and kind neighbors, people can find the strength to heal, rebuild and even thrive.
This year, World Refugee Day is focused on the power of inclusion in health systems, education, and sports. Health care because of the importance of working together to recover from the pandemic. Education because of the millions of children whose education was interrupted by the pandemic. And sports because it transcends language and nationality to bring people together. In 2021, a team of 29 refugee athletes will join the Tokyo Games with the support of UNHCR and the International Olympic and Paralympic Committees.

Title: KOICA and UNOPS deliver specialized medical beds to 13 hospitals to serve 2 million people in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
28 May 2021
Through an initiative by and with the generous support of the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) delivered 225 mechanical hospital beds, including mattresses and bed sheets, to 13 hospitals in Dushanbe, Shakhrinav and Tursunzade, as well as the Kathlon and Sughd regions. The deliveries were finalized on 28 May 2021.
The beds are expected to serve an area with a population of two million people, and approximately 6,700 patients will use them annually. This support will benefit patients that require hospital treatment, including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as long-term therapy.
This project, initiated by KOICA and implemented by UNOPS, is in direct support of the strengthening of the priority health system, in line with the COVID-19 response plan of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Population (MOHSPP) and wider UN interventions in Tajikistan.
Underlining the importance of this project, Ms. Freya von Groote, UNOPS’ Director of the Austria Multi-Country Office and Representative to Tajikistan said:
“UNOPS is honoured to continue supporting the Government of Tajikistan with enhancing the country’s healthcare systems, including to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to provide this support based on our extensive experience on cost efficient procurement, global network of suppliers and local presence in Tajikistan.”
Speaking about the deliveries, Dr. Gafur Muhsinzoda, First Deputy Minister of Health and Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tajikistan said:
“At the end of December 2020, KOICA generously provided the Government of Tajikistan with funds to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In close partnership with UNOPS, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Population was able to ensure timely, efficient and transparent procurement of mechanical hospital beds for the COVID-19 patients in over 13 hospitals, benefiting their rest and recovery.”
Reflecting on the accomplishment, Mr. Minhyeon Song, Vice President of KOICA said:
"To fulfill the objectives of Korean Government's ‘ODA Korea: Building TRUST’ strategy’, KOICA has been implementing the Comprehensive Rapid Response Program in multiple countries. KOICA expects that the beds, which UNOPS successfully procured and delivered, will assist the Government of Tajikistan in its urgent response to the Pandemic and the establishment of sustainable health service.”
Notes to the Editors:
Background
In December 2020, amidst one of the worst global health crises ever experienced, UNOPS and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population (MoHSPP) signed an agreement for an amount of US$400,000 to aid in the public health response to the crisis and support the Government in procuring and delivering 225 mechanical beds to 13 key hospitals country-wide, benefiting approximately 2 million people in Tajikistan residing in the catchment areas of the hospitals.

Title: Smallholder farmers in Tajikistan received 100 tonnes of high quality potato seed
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 May 2021
25 May 2021, Dushanbe – Today, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Tajikistan concluded the distribution of 100 tonnes of high quality potato seed to smallholder farmers to strengthen the potato seed production system in Tajikistan. The activity covered potato producers in Nurobod and Lakhsh districts of the Rasht Valley, Devashtich and Mastchohi Kuhi districts of the Sughd region, Vanj and Darvoz districts of the GBAO, as well as Khovaling district of the Khatlon region.
This initiative should give farmers access to good quality potato seeds – a critical agricultural input – and thus improve livelihoods by increasing yields and advancing production practices, which will lead to further enhancing agribusinesses in Tajikistan. Developing the system of seed replenishment at the grass-roots level through connecting smallholder producers to cooperatives and seed distributors is very critical.
The provision of high yield potato seeds for small-scale farmers will not only contribute to increased productivity of the value chain for potato seeds, but also the potatoes produced will be available for local consumption, which will improve food security and nutrition of rural populations. Moreover, it will contribute to create a strong and reliable network of key actors for an efficient and effective potato production through a better understanding on how replenishment of seed stock functions and what improvements are needed in the institutional system.
“Having geographical advantage, Tajikistan has a great potential in the production of potato seeds in Central Asia, and with the rational utilization of the existing resources this country can become the hub of high quality potato seed producer and even exporter of potato seed in the region. However, due to the pandemic, we understand the seeds became not widely available in the country and we wanted to support the farmers by providing potato seeds, fertilizers and organize trainings to strengthen technical capacity of the farmers,” emphasized Kikuchi Takeshi, Representative of JICA Tajikistan office.
Last year, the first sowing campaign of seed potatoes under a joint FAO-European Union project allowed farmers to reap a good harvest in August-September, particularly in Nurabad district of Rasht valley.
“With this support, Tajikistan has a unique opportunity to establish an economically viable, resource efficient, and environmentally sustainable production system for seed potato to supply quality seeds for farmers in Tajikistan and in the neighboring countries,” said Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan. “FAO has a remarkable experience and expertise in piloting innovative approaches to produce seed potatoes in Tajikistan. Last year’s experience demonstrated that farmers can improve production quality and quantity, through following the technology and tracking system developed and introduced by FAO.”
“The replenishment of seed stock in the country with high quality seeds will provide the smallholder farmers with better utilization of agricultural inputs and efficient land use via improved productivity,” he added.
There are existing challenges that prevent farmers from benefitting from potato production. Low quality seeds decreases harvest potential and farmers’ income. Better supply and access to high quality seed potato is very important to improve potato production and productivity. In addition, good farming practices for both seed and table potato, including favourable conditions to select quality seed and production practices, as well as postharvest handling and storage can play a major role and should be well understood and routinely applied by producers and processors.
This activity is part of a pilot project for agribusiness development in Tajikistan, funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and regional project on lifecycle management of pesticides and disposal of persistent organic pollutant pesticides in Central Asian countries and Turkey, funded by the Global Environment Facility.

Title: UNICEF and WHO brings 4,6 million doses of polio vaccine to Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
23 May 2021
Dushanbe 23 May 2021 – 4,6 million doses of polio vaccine arrived to Dushanbe early Sunday morning, 23rd of May. These vaccines will be used during the national polio immunization campaign planned for May-July 2021 to stop circulation of poliovirus. In the course of the campaign   almost 1.4 million children under the age of six will be targeted to receive oral polio vaccine to strengthen the protection against poliomyelitis. The shipment was received by the head of the Republic Center of Immunoprofilactic Mr Faizali Saidzoda and the staff of the UNICEF and World Health Organization in Tajikistan.
The vaccination campaign is led by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Population of Tajikistan, and supported by WHO and UNICEF, within the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
“UNICEF is working with partners to support local authorities to conduct important rounds of polio campaign to strengthen the immunity of the children against the poliovirus. The supplemental campaign will be accompanied by a social mobilization campaign to encourage communities to get their children vaccinated. “said Zainab Al-Azzawi, Deputy Representative for UNICEF Tajikistan.
After thorough investigation of poliomyelitis cases in the Republic of Tajikistan, the Government and health partners have been working hand-in-hand to prepare for and conduct supplemental immunization of children to prevent transmission of the virus.  According to the decree of the Government of Tajikistan, two rounds of polio vaccination campaign have been planned on 31 May to 5 June and 28 June – 3 July respectively.
“There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented through vaccination. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. Oral polio vaccine is safe and effective, its use enabled eradication of polio in most of the countries around the world. The use of oral polio vaccine in Tajikistan is crucial for preventing the virus transmission and protecting children from this crippling disease. WHO appreciates all the efforts made by the Tajik Government and health partners in preparation of the campaign and vaccine procurement and urges parents to vaccinate their children” said Dr Victor Olsavszky, WHO Representative in Tajikistan.
The polio campaign is supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a consortium dedicated to the eradication of polio. The GPEI is spearheaded by national governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF and supported by key partners including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.

Title: Experts from Tajikistan trained on the “DesInventar-Sendai” software, with support from UNDRR and the EU
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
21 May 2021
DUSHANBE– On 20-21 May, experts from Tajikistan stepped up action on disaster resilience through a training on the “DesInventar-Sendai” – a disaster information management software. The workshop was organized by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), in collaboration with CIMA Research Foundation and the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), with the support of the European Union. The event takes place within the framework of the “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia” initiative, funded by the European Union.
Measuring disaster losses is an important element in managing disaster risk. The availability of current and historical information on losses caused by disasters, analysis of tendencies, scale, and impact will help in long-term development and investment planning, in adaptation to the climate change, preparing for new emerging hazards and risks. The system is adapted to the country’s hazard profile and is based on the existing national mechanisms of disaster information.
As a main benefit, the “DesInventar Sendai” system supports a dialogue on risk management and disaster risk reduction planning between all stakeholders from the local to the regional level. This is especially important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic which has demonstrated the need to accelerate action on disaster risk reduction and to strengthen information management and exchange. The implementation of the “DesInventar Sendai” system software has helped more than 90 countries worldwide to develop sustainable disaster information management systems aligned with the Sendai Framework monitoring process. The system allows to analyze disaster trends and impacts through a large range of sectoral and socio-economical dimensions.
The two-day training included theoretical and practical exercises on the “DesInventar-Sendai” modules, and brought together specialists in data and information processing and analysis from different departments of the Committee for Emergency Situations and Civil Defense, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Committee for Environmental Protection, Agency on Statistics, and Agency for Hydrometeorology.
Background information
The EU-funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing the Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, development of regional DRR strategy, national disaster loss accounting systems, and community level disaster risk reduction. On the local level, the project supports development of disaster resilience strategies of capital cities. For this project, the EU committed EUR 3,750,000 for the three year implementation.

Title: WFP and Tajik Government sign MOU on integrated water resources management and climate change adaptation
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
19 May 2021
DUSHANBE – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation of Tajikistan have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on technical cooperation in integrated water resources management and climate change adaptation.
Within this MOU, WFP and the Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation of Tajikistan will strengthen bilateral cooperation, establish and advance the systems, modalities and procedures that will be needed to strengthen integrated water resources management as key component of climate change adaptation.
“WFP will support the Agency for Land Reclamation and Irrigation of Tajikistan in the implementation of its plan for the use of integrated water resources management within the framework of the Water Sector Reforms Programme of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2016-2025 and the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy,” said WFP Deputy Country Director and Representative, a.i. Mariko Kawabata. “With the joint efforts, we aim to enhance the adaptive capacities of vulnerable households to cope with the adverse effects of climate change”.
The sides will also strengthen technical cooperation for the improvement of an integrated water resources management approach in order to enhance the adaptative capacities of vulnerable households to cope with the adverse effects of climate change.
Through its resilience projects, WFP helps food-insecure households and communities build their common assets to boost their resilience against climate-related shocks. While they are engaged in asset creation projects, such as building and rehabilitating roads, irrigation canals, and water supply systems. Communities receive cash transfers for working on creating community assets such as irrigation systems, soil and water conservation, drinking water supply system and the construction of bridges, roads and other critical infrastructure. These reduce the risk of disaster, strengthen livelihoods, and build climate resilience.
In addition, WFP provides policy advice, technical assistance and capacity and systems strengthening to key public institutions and private sector stakeholders, such as the Committee for Emergency Situations and Civil Defence, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Chamber of Commerce, and other relevant agencies, in line with SDG 17.
In 2020, within the framework of the COVID-19 response action and through its resilience activity, WFP launched cash-for-work projects to support more than 27,000 beneficiaries in GBAO and the Rasht Valley. WFP prioritized households that were chronically food insecure and directly affected by the socioeconomic shocks, primarily due to market price spikes and reduced income from remittances. Households headed by women were of particular concern. The projects provided 6,700 participants and their families with cash assistance in exchange for their work on rehabilitating or constructing community assets such as irrigation canals, drinking water supply systems, feeder roads, and forestry areas in the targeted communities. Specific activities at the sites ensured the participation of women, despite cultural-sensitivities regarding labour-based works, and people living with physical disabilities who could not work also received assistance.

Title: UNODC supports the opening of two Border Liaison Offices on the border between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan

18 May 2021
Dushanbe, 18 May 2021 - United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Regional Office for Central Asia in partnership with the law enforcement agencies of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, opened two Border Liaison Offices (BLOs) at the railway border crossing points (BCPs) Pakhtaobod (Tajikistan) and Kudukli (Uzbekistan) on the Tajik-Uzbek border.
The opening ceremony was held at Pakhtaobod and Kudukli BCPs with the signature of the handover documents.
“The opening of the Border Liaison Office at the Pakhtaobod railway border crossing point is another link in the system of ensuring reliable protection of the state border. Its activities will contribute to the further strengthening and enhancement of interagency, regional and international cooperation. We thank the Government of the United States of America and UNODC for supporting the implementation of this initiative and for cooperating in ensuring border security,” said Colonel Rajabzoda Nasimjon Kholmurod, Deputy Commander of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan, in his welcoming speech.
“The Border Liaison Offices programme in Central Asia’s merits extend beyond the construction of a building and equipment – it supports cross-border cooperation which is essential to successful border management. Pakhtaobod and its sister office at Kudukli in Uzbekistan, are the first railway BLOs in Central Asia. They add a new dimension to the project which will require new skills and training,” said Ms. Sita Farrell, Director, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Office at the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe, in her opening remarks.
“Drawing on the resources of all the agencies at the BLO has greater potential for impact than one agency acting alone. Each agency has different authorities and therefore different information, so combining that information gives a complete picture. BLOs make such cooperation possible and effective,” Ms. Farrell added.
Ms. Ashita Mittal, UNODC Regional Representative to Central Asia, congratulated the national partners with the opening of the first railway Border Liaison Offices on the Tajik-Uzbek border and expressed hope that their operation would enhance border security and improve the cooperation between law enforcement authorities of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
“The BLO project envisages the establishment of a mechanism through which neighboring border authorities can exchange strategic information related to drug trafficking along and across borders. UNODC will continue strengthening the capacity of the Border Liaison Offices in Central Asia within the framework of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia 2021-2025 with a view of enhancing cross-border cooperation on the Tajik-Uzbek border,” said Ms. Ashita Mittal, in her opening remarks.
“It should be noted that BLOs have proven to be an effective tool in strengthening interagency and cross-border cooperation. The BLO initiative provides for the creation of a unique mechanism to counter drug trafficking. I am hopeful that these newly established offices will make a significant contribution to strengthening border security and further developing cooperation between the law enforcement agencies of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan,” said Mr. Utkir Kadirov, Deputy Chairman of the Customs Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan at the opening ceremony of the BLO at Kudukli.
The establishment of BLOs in Central Asia builds a strong foundation for further effective interagency and cross-border cooperation and intelligence-sharing to effectively counter transnational organized crime while facilitating legitimate international trade. To date, 19 BLOs have been established on the Tajik-Afghan, Uzbek-Afghan, Tajik-Uzbek, Kyrgyz-Tajik, Kyrgyz-Uzbek, Kyrgyz-Kazakh and Kazakh-Uzbek borders. Each country assigned staff for the establishment of BLOs and allocated premises at the BCPs, while technical assistance was provided by UNODC ROCA through organizing training courses and providing equipment to support the operation of the offices.
BLOs are established under the Regional Cross-Border Cooperation Component designed to counter the trafficking of Afghan opiates through the northern route. It is the first project to establish BLOs in Central Asia, and its stakeholders are the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Border Troops, Customs and Drug Control Agencies of each country. The initiative is part of Sub-programme 1 “Countering transnational organized crime, illicit drug trafficking and preventing terrorism” of the UNODC Programme for Central Asia.
The initiative on the opening of the BLOs at the Pakhtaobod - Kudulki railway border crossing points between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan was funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL).

Title: Tajikistan strengthens stakeholder engagement on disaster risk reduction
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
18 May 2021
DUSHANBE – On 18 May, the Government of Tajikistan and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) organized a workshop with the stakeholders in reduction of risk of disasters. The objective of the meeting was to introduce the systemic approach in disaster risk reduction, approaches and methods for national capacity building as well as identifying the focus areas for strengthening governance in DRR. The participants, which included members of the Tajikistan National Platform for DRR, United Nations agencies, and other local and international stakeholders, discussed the application of a systematic approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR) in Tajikistan.
The event was conducted as part of the UNDRR Initiative “Strengthening resilience to disasters and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, funded by European Union. The workshop comes at an important moment when the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing climate change impact have elevated the importance of the systemic approach to strengthening the resilience of the region and countries with regard to multi-dimensional risks. In addition, these developments have further underlined the importance of investment in disaster prevention.
Mr. Tojiddin Mahmadov, the Head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Department of the General Directorate for Protection of Population and Territories of the Committee for Emergency Situations And Civil Defence under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan said: “Taking advantage of the systemic approach to disaster risk reduction and the effective involvement of all stakeholders in risk management is designed to improve government coordination mechanisms as well as to strengthen regional cooperation in disaster risk reduction.”
Mr. Giuseppe Aristei, Programme Manager of the EU Delegation to Tajikistan stressed: “The EU is committed to continue to support and to improve preparedness and planning, employing evidence-driven decision-making and innovative technologies, such as remote sensing in the context of disaster risk reduction. We encourage pursuing the effective implementation of the national strategy and the development of relevant tools such as the national disaster loss databases across the region.”
“The workshop today has once again shown the strong commitment of the Government of Tajikistan and the stakeholders to the inclusive, all-of-society approach in the implementation of the Sendai Framework and reducing disaster risks,” said Abdurahim Muhidov, the representative of UNDRR.
Over the past years, Tajikistan has significantly increased its capacity in disaster risk reduction to accelerate the accomplishment of the targets identified in the Sendai Framework. As part of these efforts Tajikistan adopted the National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management in 2010, established the National DRR Platform in 2012, and adopted the revised National Strategy for DRR in 2019 – a new document outlining the vision and commitments for DRR for the period until 2030.  These major steps and the commitment of the Government of Tajikistan ensure that local resources and international partnerships are mobilised to pursue risk-informed sustainable development. As next steps Tajikistan plans to continue the work together with international partners in strengthening the national coordination and building capacity in information management.
Background information
The EU-funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing the Sendai Framework priorities.

05 May 2021
The roundtable discussion dedicated to the World Press Freedom Day (WPFD) -took place in Dushanbe with the participation of the journalists, mass media experts and representatives, public organizations, state institutions as well as the UN Resident Coordinator and UN agencies.
The event was organized by the UN Resident Coordinator's Office with support of OHCHR in Tajikistan, UNESCO Almaty Cluster Office for Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and public organization "Khoma". It aimed at commemorating the global Press Freedom Day marked globally on 03 May and discussing issues around the media viability in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also explored joint actions among participants to ensure access to verified, factual, and credible information as a public good to all COVID-19 recovery efforts to build back better and more resilient societies around the globe.
In his opening statement Mr. Saimurod Fattohzoda Parliament Member, Chairperson of the Information, International Relations and Public Organizations Department of the Parliament noted the importance of cooperation with mass media and reaffirmed commitment for further enhancement of the situation with access to quality and timely information for the public good.
Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator noted in her opening remarks: “In the 21st century -  in an era of information and digitalization, full and safe access to mass media and social networks is vital for collective knowledge and creation of shared prosperity. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how access to reliable information is important to save lives. Let us work together to ensure mass media have enough capacity to access and share verified content so that everyone is able to enjoy their right to access information”.
Several thematic presentations were provided during the meeting around this year’s topic, such as human rights mechanisms and access to information; access to the official information and sharing verified content, and media preparedness to operate in times of COVID19.  Participants concluded that the shift to online media and the wide expanse of social media should not create barriers to the right to access information. Efforts should be made to further the population’s media and information literacy as one of the key competencies in the modern world so as to enable them to detect fake or erroneous news, use credible information, and make safe and informed decisions.
Note: The World Press Freedom Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 1993, following negotiations at a UNESCO conference in Windhoek, Namibia in 1991. It serves as an occasion to inform citizens of their right to freedom of expression and difficulties associated with the exercise of this right around the world. In 2021, marking the 30 years since the Windhoek Conference, the World Press Freedom Day focuses on contemporary issues for freedom of expression, access to information, and the public service role of journalism within the changed communications ecosystem.

Title: WFP News Release:  WFP and Tajik Government sign MOU on climate change adaptation
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
30 April 2021
DUSHANBE – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the Agency for Forestry of the Republic of Tajikistan have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to work together to build Government capacity to adapt to climate change.
Within this MOU, WFP and the Agency of Forestry of the Republic of Tajikistan will collaborate in developing and disseminating information on forestry management in relation to local climate, establishing 400 hectares of orchards and agroforestry covering 200 hectares. In addition, training on tree selection suited to local ecosystems, planting, and application of compost is planned for the employees of the Agency. Training on drying fruits from the orchards, vegetables and herbs, processing, and preservation would be also considered in the future.
WFP will also raise awareness about climate change and adaptation among the 50,000 people participating in the project, ensuring they have timely and relevant climate information for household decision-making when it comes to food security.
“This MoU will pave the way for wide ranging bilateral cooperation towards our common goal of improving food security in Tajikistan. WFP will continue enhancing the capacity of the Agency for Forestry at both the local and regional levels in natural resource management and climate change adaptation, particularly in the areas of afforestation, reforestation and agroforestry,” said WFP Deputy Country Director and Representative, a.i. Mariko Kawabata.
Through its resilience projects, WFP helps food-insecure households and communities build their common assets to boost their resilience against climate-related shocks. While they are engaged in asset creation projects, such as building and rehabilitating roads, irrigation canals, and water supply systems.
In 2020, within the framework of the COVID-19 response action and through its food assistance for assets creation activity, WFP launched cash-for-work projects to support more than 27,000 beneficiaries in GBAO and the Rasht Valley. WFP prioritized households that were chronically food insecure and directly affected by the socioeconomic shocks, primarily due to market price spikes and reduced income from remittances. Households headed by women were of particular concern. The projects provided 6,700 participants and their families with cash assistance in exchange for their work on rehabilitating or constructing community assets such as irrigation canals, drinking water supply systems, feeder roads, and forestry areas in the targeted communities. Specific activities at the sites ensured the participation of women, despite cultural-sensitivities regarding labour-based works, and people living with physical disabilities who could not work also received assistance.

Title: SDG Global Festival Of Action - A Turning Point for People and Planet

25 March 2021
Over 20,000 gather at the SDG Global Festival of Action, calling for transformative change to turn things around for people and the planet
Calling for the beginning of a ‘new era’ following COVID-19 recovery, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed alongside United Nations Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner, spoke today at the fifth annual SDG Global Festival of Action, bringing to attention the urgent need for economic and social change that protects our ecosystems and humanity’s well-being.
The Deputy Secretary-General stated her support for an inter-generational transition, putting youth at the forefront to allow them to shape the SDG agenda, and encouraged countries to listen to its young people to ensure we don’t return to business as usual.
Convened over two days, from 25 to 26 March, under the theme ‘A Turning Point for People and Planet’, the Festival connected government and private sector leaders with changemakers, activists, creatives and more, hosting talks, performances, interactive workshops, and exhibits to inspire and mobilize action. Because of the pandemic, the dynamic in-person event moved to a virtual platform, elevating its attendance to over 20,000 remote participants from 203 countries and territories, making it the largest and most geographically diverse Festival ever.
With the world still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and many countries still in lockdown, the year 2021 was framed as a critical year to accelerate progress on the SDGs, with climate, gender equality, poverty and inequalities, and sustainable financing firmly in focus. The Festival aimed to scale up both awareness and ambition ahead of important events such as the G20 meetings, The Generation Equality Forum, The Food Systems Summit, and the important COP climate conferences in Italy and Scotland towards the end of the year. Over 300 speakers from 80+ countries represented the wide range of SDG stakeholders, came together to share their knowledge and experience on how to tackle the world’s ongoing challenges, present solutions, and discuss what is at stake if we fail to meet the promises of the Sustainable Development Goals.
“It’s become clear that everyone has a role in advancing this transformation,’ said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator. “On the one hand, we need new policies that steer our societies in the right direction. On the other, each of us is an agent for change. Our individual behaviors will add up to make the difference - powerfully so.” Marina Ponti, Director of the SDG Action Campaign who organized the Festival, echoed the sense of optimism and called to seize the opportunities that came with the unprecedented global crisis we saw last year, noting that we should use what we’ve learned to shift the way we live, consume, earn and produce. “Together, we can dream big. We can act with shared hearts and convictions. And we can generate a global turning point that resets our world for good.”
Other speakers during the opening day included SDG Advocate and disability activist Eddie Ndopu who talked about how the pandemic has caused pre-existing inequities to bubble up to the surface, including a crisis of inequality, the ecological breakdown of the planet, and systemic injustices - yet shared optimism in the fact that it has also compounded humanity’s capacity for creativity, genius and resilience. David Nabarro, Special Envoy of WHO on COVID-19, echoed Eddie’s statement in his talk highlighting that only by working together and supporting each other will humanity come through this pandemic with the strength it needs to help set the world on the right path.
Chairman of Japan SDGs Action Promotion Council, Norichika Kanie, was proud to represent Japan as they became the first country to host a local edition of the Festival - the SDG Global Festival of Action from Japan, an integral component of this year’s Global Festival. Sharing local solutions and setting an example of a nationwide movement for action, the spin-off was curated by 12 UN agencies based in Japan and featured Goodwill Ambassadors Misako Konno (UNDP) and MIYAVI (UNHCR), popular comedian Yuriyan Retriever, and many other multi-sectoral stakeholders. Dr. Kanie urged that we work together to combine our solutions for people and the planet, to light the spark for action following the vision set out by the Sustainable Development Agenda.
Representing youth climate advocates, Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines joined with an impassioned plea to recognize and empower marginalized sectors of society, especially those from the global south, who are on the frontlines of the unequal impacts of climate change, and who are not always included in the conversations on how to confront the crisis.
To interact and engage the participants at the Festival, organizations, and experts helped organize 27 workshops focusing on ideation, upskilling, campaign activation, and well-being, creating a unique and personalized experience for the 10,000 participants that signed up to join just the workshops alone. Workshop hosts included civil society organizations such as Social Watch, Project Everyone, Humanity Lab Foundation, and the World Organisation of the Scout Movement, with more lined up for Day 2.
The creative arts were also represented with musical contributions from global artist Yoko Ono with her ode to the planet ‘I love you Earth’, as well as performances from climate activists including Patti Smith, Bomba Estéreo, and Tenzin Choegyal scheduled for Day 2, The 20 exhibits that were available to participants throughout the program included exclusive pieces by La Triennale Di Milano, street art, photography and immersive media by Oculus, Lavazza, CANON, Google Arts & Culture Lab, and Terry Riley and Sasha Waltz.

17 March 2021
ALMATY– On 17 March, 16 technical experts from Central Asia have been trained in the framework of the EU-funded project on strengthening disaster risk reduction in the region. The training aimed to improve national reporting on achieving the targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the major international agreement to reduce and prevent disaster risks across the globe. The training session was organized by the Center for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk Reduction (CESDRR) in Almaty with the support from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the implementer of the EU-funded project.
The annual national reporting on the implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is the instrument and the process that provides comprehensive picture on the national progress, needs and priorities in building the resilience to disasters. The Sendai Monitor is tool that informs the national authorities and the international community on the progress in disaster risk reduction in the country, as well as supports national decision making in long-term development.
During the event, Director of the Strategic Planning Department at Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), Mr. Bill Ho, outlined the common challenges of the Sendai Framework reporting process and elaborated on the ways to overcome these challenges. Head of National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction of Kyrgyzstan Mr. Almabek Aydakeev, shared the experience of the Kyrgyz Republic in reporting on the indicators of the Sendai Framework Monitor.

Title: Sustainable Development Goals can guide North and Central Asia to build back better, says UN report
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
16 March 2021
Almaty (ESCAP News) – The Asia-Pacific region must accelerate progress everywhere and urgently reverse its regressing trends on many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve its ambitions by 2030, says a report released today by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
The 2021 edition of the Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report shows that the region fell short of its 2020 milestones for the Goals, even before entering the global pandemic.  In the last decade, Asia and the Pacific has made extraordinary progress in good health and well-being (Goal 3), which may partly explain its relative success in reducing the health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its population. Yet despite these hard-won gains, the region faces many challenges, such as providing an adequate healthcare workforce, reducing premature deaths and improving mental health.
Despite good progress on several goals, North and Central Asian countries need to redouble efforts in reversing negative trends. The prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity in the subregion is approximately 17 per cent of the total population and has been increasing in recent years. North and Central Asia also need to reverse current trends on inequality indices for education, gender parity in labour force participation and compliance with labour rights.
An alarming observation in the report is regressing climate action trends (Goal 13) and life below water (Goal 14). The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for more than half of the global greenhouse gas emissions and adverse impacts of natural disasters on people and economies increase year-by-year. As we find our way out of this pandemic, the report suggests we must focus efforts on more equitable and greener growth.
“Recovery measures are an excellent opportunity for us to rethink our options for development pathways that are inclusive, more resilient, and respect planetary boundaries,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and ESCAP Executive Secretary Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. “As we enter the Decade of Action to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to reinforce our collective commitment to the SDGs and let it provide our compass for building back together, better and greener.”
The report highlights the impact of mandatory lockdowns and social distancing measures on data collection activities, particularly from vulnerable groups. To build back better, Governments should renew their commitments to the SDGs’ monitoring framework so that recovery can accelerate a global transformation as promised by the 2030 Agenda.
As part of its commitment to support countries with national-level follow-up and review of the SDGs, ESCAP has developed a “National SDG Tracker” tool for countries looking to replicate the progress assessment found in the report. National governments can use the tool to produce snapshots of progress towards the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda.

24 February 2021
More than 17,000 individuals from a variety of backgrounds across Tajikistan participated in the online survey and in local dialogues held in 2020 under the auspices of the global campaign. In cooperation with the Government of Tajikistan, the United Nations’ goal was to engage wide segments of society with a special emphasis on women, youth, and those whose voices are too often marginalized or not heard.
In 2020, the United Nations launched a global conversation to mark its 75th anniversary. Through an online survey and local dialogues, over the course of 12 months, people from all countries and all walks of life were asked about their hopes and fears for the future.
“The national conversation campaign showed that despite the COVID-19 pandemic and economic slowdown, the people of Tajikistan are generally keeping their optimism about the future. The top long-term priorities of respondents related to respect for human rights, increased employment opportunities, and improved health care services, while 88% of respondents highlighted the importance of international cooperation to achieving these goals and noted the importance of addressing global challenges jointly.” - Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator.
The national conversation campaign included: online and off-line dialogues with decision-makers, women, girls, and youth, civil society organizations working with persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups; digital information campaigns, quizzes, and Q&A sessions through social media, an online drawing, and video contest under the title of "Postcards from the Future”, TV programs and a town hall meeting with all UN personnel in the country.
The report provides an analysis and key findings of the campaign and is designed to also feed into the future programming of the United Nations and the development of a new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework jointly with the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan.

Title: Supermodel and philanthropist Natalia Vodianova teams up with UNFPA to end the stigma around women’s bodies and health
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 February 2021
New York, 24 February 2021 - Supermodel, philanthropist and impact investor, Natalia Vodianova was today appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency. UNFPA and Ms. Vodianova will unite to empower women and girls by tackling the stigma and taboos that surround their bodies and health and lead to pervasive discrimination and exclusion.
“For too long, society’s approach to menstruation and women’s health has been defined by taboo and stigma. And this has undermined the most basic needs and rights of women. It is now our responsibility to culturally redefine what is normal,” says Natalia Vodianova. “Menstruation is a normal bodily function. As UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador, I want to work to build a world where we no longer need to explain this.”
Menstruation is a monthly challenge for billions of people worldwide. On any given day, more than 800 million girls and women between ages 15 and 49 are menstruating. They might face exclusion from public life, barriers to opportunities, sanitation and health, heightened vulnerability and even life-threatening neglect. For too long, this issue has not received enough attention, but this has slowly started to change in recent years and achieving this change is central to UNFPA’s mandate.
“It’s a tragic irony that something as universal as menstruation can make girls feel so isolated,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “We all have a role to play in breaking the taboos around menstruation, and UNFPA is pleased to partner with such a powerful and committed advocate. Societies prosper when girls are confident, empowered and making their own decisions!”
Over the past three years, Ms. Vodianova and UNFPA have hosted a series of global events together under the “Let’s Talk” banner to dismantle taboos and advance women’s health and gender equality. These events have inspired action from governments, civil society and the private sector to create an environment in which women and girls can live free from shame, exclusion and discrimination. Change-makers, policy-shapers and influencers from sectors including fashion, politics, sports, civil society, technology and media have gathered in Turkey, Kenya, Switzerland, Belarus and India to raise the standard for women’s health around the world.
Raised in poverty by her mother in Russia, with a half-sister who has cerebral palsy and autism, Natalia Vodianova is a passionate advocate for human rights, including reproductive rights and the rights of people living with disabilities. Strongly established in the sectors of fashion and technology, she will work to connect these industries with the United Nations to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

Title: Russian Federation and WFP provide support to families of most vulnerable schoolchildren in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
22 February 2021
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has begun delivering fortified wheat flour and vegetable oil to the families of  vulnerable schoolchildren in the Khatlon Region of Tajikistan, supported by USD 1 million from the Russian Federation.

The 1,200 tons of wheat flour and 50 tons of vegetable oil were purchased will meet the needs of around 22,000 households. Families living in Sughd and Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous (GBAO) regions, Roghun town as well as the districts of Rasht Valley will receive similar support.
“For many years, Russia has been helping build an effective national school feeding system in Tajikistan. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, it was important for us to provide additional targeted assistance to schoolchildren and their families who need it most. We believe that this will not only enrich their diet, but also contribute to their educational outcomes,” said the Russian Ambassador to Tajikistan Igor Semenovich Lyakin-Frolov.
This food assistance remains part of the WFP School Feeding Programme, reaching over 600,000 students from grades 1 to 4 in 2,000 schools across 52 rural districts of Tajikistan with regular healthy and nutritious meals. In 2020, Russia allocated USD 5 million to WFP to purchase 3,000 tons of fortified wheat flour and over 300 tons of vegetable oil for schools in Tajikistan. As part of its response to COVID-19, WFP provided one-off take-home food rations to 24,000 vulnerable families whose children are part of WFP’s School Feeding Programme.
“We are thankful to the Russian Federation for its contribution to the WFP School Feeding Programme. COVID-19 has impacted household food and nutrition security, especially among the vulnerable population. The additional contribution comes timely, which allowed us to deliver the food assistance at the peak lean season when household food insecurity is at its highest due to high food prices and limited income generating opportunities.” said WFP Deputy Country Director and Representative, a.i. in Tajikistan Mariko Kawabata.
In addition to providing food, the School Feeding Programme is also supporting the technical modernization of Tajikistan's school feeding system, including the renovation and construction of school canteens, bakeries and greenhouses, for which the Russian Federation has allocated more than USD 28 million since 2012.
Russia is a strategic partner of Tajikistan in the field of humanitarian aid. Since 2005, the Government of the Russian Federation has allocated USD 83.5 million for the supply of food to vulnerable people in the country.
Since 1999, the World Food Programme has been collaborating with the Government of Tajikistan to improve the national school feeding system. This reflects WFP's strong commitment to changing the lives of the country's population for the better. Providing schoolchildren with healthy meals not only improve nutrition and health but also improves access to education.

Title: FAO scales up national food control systems in Tajikistan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
12 February 2021
12 February 2021, Dushanbe – National food control systems play a crucial role in ensuring food safety throughout the food chain. Everyone participating in the food chain from regulators, farmers to processors, distributors, retailers, and consumers has some responsibility for food safety and quality.
A teleconference on practical details for implementing food inspections and practical considerations for sampling honey and apricots for food safety concluded today in Dushanbe. The event aimed to strengthen the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan's food safety and quality control system.
Participants represented the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, Committee for Environmental Protection, Committee for Food Security under the Government of Tajikistan, Plant Protection and Chemicalization and Crop Production departments of the Ministry of Agriculture, Tajik agency for standardization, certification, metrology, and trade inspection (Tajikstandard) and private sector.
The participants had an opportunity to learn about the fundamental components of national and international food control systems and the importance of official control and monitoring systems for honey and apricots production. They shared experiences and knowledge on improving food chain safety and exchanged recommendations related to strengthening cooperation with the national and regional bodies to furtherance control systems for apricots and honey.
"Implementing food inspection has a critical place in food safety and quality control systems. Nowadays, it is very urgent and important to maintain food safety along food supply chains to ensure that the food is safe for human consumption inside the country and also complies with international safety standards to ensure it is safe to be imported. In this regard, the effective and efficient regulations are viewed as central elements to enforce national food control systems," pointed out Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan.
Food safety and quality control are primarily the responsibility of food producers and processors; they benefit economically from selling their products. Simultaneously, the public has a right to safe and healthy food and the governments, therefore, pass regulations to ensure that this right is preserved.
It is worth noting that previously in March - December 2020 and January -February 2021 FAO organized a series of teleconferences on use of veterinary medicinal products, complete comparison analysis of regulatory food safety and quality criteria applicable to honey and apricots, risk categorization of food business operators, general aspects of planning food inspections, etc. for national partners.
The teleconferences were organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), under the project "Enabling market access for Tajik agricultural products through improved food safety system" jointly implemented with the International Trade Center. The project is funded by the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF).
The project's main objective is to support Tajikistan with institutional, regulatory, and participatory solutions to improve the legislative base and official controls related to the safety of honey and apricots to ensure wholesome food and food security.

25 January 2021
A two-day training on the basics of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), including interpreting and documenting results, as well as quality control procedures starts today under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) with the support of the Committee for Food Security under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan.
The main goal of the event was to increase national expertise, especially of the technical workforce, for better biosafety measures including risk analysis, appropriate bio-containment practices and monitoring environment and food safety with regards to genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
The training programme has been tailored to meet the needs of a very specific audience, including leading specialists and experts, representing the National Center for Diagnostics, the phytosanitary and the veterinary and animal breeding departments of the Committee for Food Security under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, Tajik agency for standardization, metrology, certification and trade inspection “Tajikstandard”, the Laboratory of Biosafety and the Institute of Botany, Plant Physiology and Genetics of the Tajik National Academy of Sciences and other relevant national stakeholders.
They will learn to detect genetically modified organisms in food crops, important in the process of reviewing biosafety-related decision-making and concepts and methodologies relevant to risk analysis of genetically modified organism release and biosafety management.
“Capacity building is at the heart of FAO’s mandate. Indeed, insufficient access to information, lack of coordination, as well as inadequate capacities have major consequences in applying the national regulatory frameworks. The training programme for regulatory officials will support to expand the technical expertise on agro-related biosafety issues at the national level,” pointed out Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Tajikistan.
In December 2020, FAO organized a series of trainings on GMO risk assessment, regulations and actions on positive findings, working in compliance with ISO 17025 for national partners, in addition a training on real-time GMO detection and advanced systems is expected to in the near future.
The development of an effective coordination mechanism, involving the main stakeholders and ensuring coordination of roles and responsibilities among the relevant authorities dealing with biosafety, forms the base for a solid institutional setting at national level.
The training is part of an FAO Technical Cooperation Programme to improve capacity and monitoring system of genetically modified organisms in Tajikistan, which aims at enhancing the national capacity in monitoring and control of GMO and thus facilitating in increasing trade of agricultural products and economic relation between Tajikistan and other countries.

Title: Government and United Nations in Tajikistan met to discuss financing framework for achievement of national priorities and SDGs
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
24 December 2020
The First Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade, Mr. Ashurboy Solehzoda, and the UN Resident Coordinator a.i. Mr. Oleg Guchgeldiyev, convened a meeting of senior decision-makers from government, the United Nations and national and international development partners, to discuss the financing framework for achieving national development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals 2030.
The Government of Tajikistan and the United Nations are partnering on a new initiative launched in the context of this meeting to improve the financing framework and resource mobilization for the National Development Strategy 2016-2030 and national SDG targets. This initiative focuses on improving alignment between planning and financing processes, conducting analyses of public expenditures in key sectors in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness of financing, and improving partnerships with the private sector to increase investments in sectors of the economy that have a positive social impact.
Both the Government and the United Nations reiterated that it will not be possible to meet national development objectives without a significant increase in financing from both domestic and international sources, and especially increasing the share of private financing and investment in Tajikistan. While the COVID-19 crisis has created great hardship and increased the need for resources to finance development goals, it has also created new opportunities with many countries reviewing how they plan to finance their development goals and exploring new approaches that blend different types of financing. This remains an area of great untapped potential for Tajikistan.
The partnership on financing the SDGs is supported by the UN Joint SDG Fund and brings together the integrated policy advice of UNICEF, UNDP and UN Women, in partnership with the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ministry of Finance, State Committee on Investments and State Property Management, Ministry of Education and Science, the Lower Chamber of Parliament, other relevant state organizations, local governments, development partners and the private sector.
Opening the meeting, Mr. Ashurboy Solehzoda - First Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade expressed his gratitude to the UN agencies and other partners for their support and efforts in the area of enhancing financing policy, addressing financial gaps and resource mobilization to achieve national priorities and the SDGs and hoped to further strengthen cooperation.
Mr. Oleg Guchgeldiyev, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. in Tajikistan noted “Many countries are reviewing their national financing frameworks and identifying how they can attract innovative types of financing to achieve their SDG targets. Public financing and official development assistance (ODA) will not be sufficient to finance the achievement of the SDGs.”
The UN Joint SDG Fund supports countries to accelerate their progress towards the SDGs and to deliver on the commitment of the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind. The UN Joint SDG Fund is funded by the European Union, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

“The Russian Federation has been supporting WFP in Tajikistan since 2005. We would like to thank the Russian Federation for its collaboration with WFP and considerable and consistent support, which has proven crucial in assisting Tajik schoolchildren,” said WFP Deputy Country Director and Representative in Tajikistan Mariko Kawabata.
The handover ceremony was attended by representatives from WFP, the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan, the Ministry of Education and Science of Tajikistan, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population of Tajikistan and other partners.
Currently, around 500,000 Tajik schoolchildren from grades 1 to 4 in 2,000 schools across 52 rural districts are served hot, nutritious soup or other local meals and a piece of traditional bread baked using staple food commodities provided by WFP. In addition, with the support of the Russian Federation, WFP also works on the renovation of school canteens, bakeries, the further training of staff at Tajik schools and advocating healthy diets.
The School Feeding Programme is WFP’s largest operation in Tajikistan and represents the organization’s strong commitment to changing lives. In vulnerable and food insecure communities, providing healthy food to children at school means better nutrition, improved health as well as increased access to education.
In Tajikistan, WFP focuses on supporting development programmes that help strengthen institutional capacities. Since 1999, the organization has been partnering with the Government of Tajikistan to implement and manage school feeding in the country.
With the financial support of the Russian Federation, WFP, in cooperation with the Russian NGO Social and Industrial Foodservice Institute (SIFI), is working with the Tajik Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population and the Ministry of Education and Science towards the gradual transition of the School Feeding Programme to full national ownership starting from 2021.

Title: Central Asia countries strengthen coordination in disaster risk reduction
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
11 December 2020
In the annual meeting, the delegations of the countries analyzed the implementation of the Action Plan (Roadmap) for the implementation of the Framework for strengthening regional cooperation of Central Asian countries in the field of DRR and emergency situations in 2019-2021 adopted by the 2019 Regional Forum - Meeting of Heads of NDMAs. The national delegations reiterated the importance of preparedness for the new emerging threats such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reiterated the value of exchange of information and experience in building capacity for reducing the possible losses.
The program of the Forum included presentation of the first draft of the Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction, developed by CESDRR within the EU-funded Initiative. The strategy, aiming at reducing risk of cross-border scale and nature, calls for better exchange of information, joint risk assessment, building capacity of emergency management organizations, raising awareness of the existing and possible new hazards.
“We realize the importance of resilience at all levels, the importance of a strategy for regional cooperation, because not a single country can protect its population all by itself from the pandemic or from other threats”, stated Boobek Azhikeyev, Minister of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyz Republic.
“It is inspiring to see how Central Asia countries come together to share experiences, lessons learned and good practices. Just recently, in September this year, all five countries met to share experience and to coordinate actions for overcoming the COVID-19, together with international organizations. The work of the CESDRR is another concrete example of these critical efforts’, said Mr. Octavian Bivol Chief Regional Office for Europe, UNDRR.  “Next year is an important one for Member States for developing a resilient, green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening risk reduction initiatives, and improving governance. Disaster risk reduction is an investment to ensure that “never again” will we suffer such devastating consequences, whether from a biological hazard like COVID-19 or climate change.
“Strengthening resilience to potential natural disasters at all levels, from community to governments, has been an essential part of European Union’s disaster risk reduction efforts in Central Asia. Since 2003, European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO) has continuously implemented activities under its disaster preparedness program known as DIPECHO. Over the years, with a total of approximately 47 mln Euro and more than 110 projects, DIPECHO managed to promote DRR in Central Asian countries.”  - said Johannes Madsen, Head of Cooperation in Central Asia.
The Regional Forum adopted the outcome document, resolving to: acknowledge the information on the activities in disaster risk reduction in the region; further consolidate and enhance regional coordination; review the draft Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction for 2022 – 2030 and the draft Regional Risk Profile and contribute in their finalization. Central Asian states expressed willingness to work together in order to strengthen risk reduction governance and to reduce existing and future risks.
The Regional Forum brought together National Emergency Management Organizations, Sendai Focal Points, international organizations working in the area of emergency response and risk reduction, representatives of the European Union and UN system organizations.

Background information
The EU funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, including development of regional DRR strategy, regional data loss database, and enhancing the role of CESDRR as the center of excellence, the secretariat of regional platform for DRR, and a hub for regional coordination. The support on national level includes assistance in developing/adjusting national DRR strategies, disaster loss database, and establishment of national platforms for DRR. On the local level, the project will support assessment of resilience of major cities to disasters. For this project the EU committed EURO 3,750,000 for the three yeas implementation.

In Central Asia and Afghanistan the Programme is focused on strengthening efforts to end sexual and gender based-violence against women and girls and by symbolically shining a spotlight on barriers that hinder them from development.
Addressing the audience, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed noted that “since the outbreak of COVID-19 gender-based and domestic violence has increased globally, and the countries in Central Asia and Afghanistan are no exception”.
The ultimate goal of the Spotlight Programme is to create an environment where there is zero tolerance for sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices, which the national stakeholders and an estimated 35 million women and girls in the five Central Asian countries and Afghanistan will contribute to and benefit from.
EU Ambassador to Kazakhstan Mr. Sven-Olov Carlsson noted: “I am convinced that the Spotlight Initiative will benefit from the longstanding leadership and active support of governments, institutions and civil society organisations in this region. I am glad to acknowledge that governments and institutions have committed themselves to promoting gender equality. We are therefore looking forward to the robust implementation of relevant laws and policies”.
Working in partnership with key institutions and diverse partners, the Spotlight Initiative will focus on developing good practices as well as forging alliances in the region around areas such as legislative reform, institutional strengthening, tackling social norms and attitudes, strengthening civil society and women’s movements. The measures will also include digital literacy training and engaging key stakeholders to contribute to respecting and protecting women’s and girls’ rights. The Initiative is coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office in Kazakhstan and is implemented through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UN Women.
In her address to partners and invited guests, the United Nations Resident Coordinator Designate for Kazakhstan, Michaela Friberg-Storey emphasized: “The Spotlight Initiative will provide an important platform for the United Nations to support the countries as they tackle the pandemic of violence, one that threatens individual health and integrity, families, communities, and the global efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in this region”.
During the event participants spoke about their work and the challenges when addressing violence against women and girls. There was a collective agreement that all stakeholders, from the UN, EU, government, chiefs, women, men, girls and boys, need to be involved, and behaviours and mindsets need to be changed to combat any form of violence.
The Spotlight Initiative provides an opportunity for a multi-sectoral, coordinated and holistic approach in addressing violence against women and girls working through multiple stakeholders including governments, service providers, civil society and other key stakeholders. Being launched during a landmark year – celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the Spotlight initiative provides an opportunity to highlight the women’s right to a life free from violence.

The opening ceremony of the training centre was attended by Vise-president  of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tajikistan Muhammad Abdurahmon Navruz, the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Republic of Tajikistan Mr Igor Lyakin-Frolov,  Director of the IED NAS RT Dr Sharif Rakhimzoda, UNFPA Tajikistan Country Director Mr Yu Yu (online), UNFPA Tajikistan Head of Office Dr Nargis Rakhimova, as well as by officers of the above organisations and media representatives. The main goal of the Project is to identify/address demographic data-related gaps and improve data use for planning, programming, budgeting, and investments.

“In the spirit of strategic partnership and alliance, Russia provides continued support for the development of Tajikistan, including in the field of demographic statistics, which plays a key role in building-up the  socio-economic policy of the country for years to come,” noted  Igor Lyakin-Frolov, the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Republic of Tajikistan.
The new training centre houses modern equipment, in particular, 16 PCs, 2 MFPs (printers), videoconferencing system, interactive whiteboard, projector, as well as air conditioner and numerous furniture. Also, UNFPA purchased 16 STATA software licenses and 16 Eviews software licenses.
As a next step, UNFPA will work on building analytical capacity of national partners employing powerful statistical packages to enhance socio-economic and demographic projection/forecasting, modelling tools, data manipulation, visualization, statistics and automated reporting. The knowledge gained will be used for data analysis, forecasting/projection on national and sub-national levels to produce a series of policy-oriented researches/surveys that contribute to evidence-based national policy formulation.
The Government of the Russian Federation has allocated US $ 2.15 million to support this project.

Title: Committee of Women and Family Affairs, UN and EU launch 16 days of activism against gender-based violence in Tajikistan

25 November 2020
Campaign was launched on 25 November, which is globally marked as International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Key issues discussed during the event included the importance of acting and facilitating dialogue and transformations within families and communities and mobilizing youth, social media and civil society to prevent GBV and challenge harmful stereotypes and social norms and promote positive alternatives, through engagement of men both young and old.
This year, #16DaysOfActivism campaign takes place in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic during which countries around the world have seen an alarming increase in the prevalence of gender-based violence during lockdowns, access to and funding for services as decreased and frontline service providers have reprioritized pandemic response.

Nearly one in five women worldwide has experienced violence in the past year globally. In Tajikistan the government-issued Demographic and Health Survey data from 2017 showed that one in three women has experienced gender-based violence.
Ms. Sezin Sinanoglu, UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan noted: “During the COVID-19 pandemic women are suffering a shadow pandemic of gender-based violence. Without a significant increase in action, resources and mobilization, there is a risk of losing years of slow but hard-fought gains; decades of progress and millions of lives are at risk. We must keep gender-based violence at the top of government agendas and engage the public more broadly during this difficult time.”
Ms. Hilolbi Qurbonzoda Jumakhon, Chair of Committee of Family and Women Affairs under the Government of the RT, emphasized in her opening remarks: “The Government of Tajikistan is strong in its determination to end violence against women and girls and provide them with all opportunities for harmonious development and meaningful contribution to the development processes. We appreciate the unique important role development partners play assisting the Government in achieving SDGs and promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment.”
The theme of the 2020 campaign is “Orange the World: Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!” and reflects growing global priority actions to address the needs of women and girls experiencing gender-based violence and especially as it has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
To demonstrate their commitment, support, and solidarity with the global campaign, people all over the world light up their communities in orange, as the orange color symbolizes a brighter, free of violence future for women and girls.
In Tajikistan, the Orange Day campaign has been marked for several years, and this year traditional lighting ceremonies of landmark buildings by UN House, Office of the EU Delegation will be joined by other buildings in Dushanbe, including German Embassy, British Embassy, Swiss Development and Cooperation Office and Sozidanie Business Center, which will also be turned into orange color to show support to the campaign and global solidarity to eradicate all forms of violence against women and girls.
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is an international campaign that takes place each year commencing on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and lasts till 10 December, Human Rights Day, indicating that violence against women is the most pervasive breach of human rights worldwide. Each year Tajikistan joins the campaign featuring large-scale mass events to raise awareness and change perception towards violence against women and girls.  https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action/16-days-of-activism

18 November 2020
MOHSPP and UNOPS signed an agreement in May 2020 to procure and deliver USD 5.3 million of lifesaving equipment and PPE to tackle the COVID-19 crisis. The project has allowed UNOPS to support the Government of Tajikistan in strengthening the capacity of the health sector, by providing technical support, procurement services and delivery of critical medical equipment and supplies for the treatment of COVID-19 patients and protection of the hospital staff.
The 34 items procured and supplied in the period September to November 2020 include amongst others ICU ventilators, ICU electric beds, oxygen concentrators, mobile X-Rays, blood gas analysers, patient monitors, infusion pumps, ECGs, protective masks, coveralls, goggles and hand rub alcohol. In addition to delivering these items, also assembly, calibrating and training are included by UNOPS for the benefit of the medical staff.
“UNOPS is proud to be partnering with the Government of Tajikistan and The World Bank to respond to the COVID-19 crisis by providing lifesaving and protective equipment and supplies across the country,” said Freya von Groote, UNOPS Austria Multi-Country Office Director.
“Drawing on our procurement expertise and global and regional supplier networks, UNOPS provides holistic support to the benefit of the Tajik population and the public health services, including the installation of equipment and training services to ensure that equipment and supplies are optimally used and maintained,” she continued.
Around 1.8 million people across the country benefit from this project, in hospitals in Dushanbe, Gisar, Varzob, Khujand, Bokhtar, Kulob, Rasht and Khorog.
“In April 2020, The World Bank mobilized emergency funds to provide immediate assistance to the Government of Tajikistan to prepare and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In partnership with  UNOPS, the Government was able to ensure timely, efficient and transparent procurement of lifesaving medical supplies and equipment for local hospitals so that they are equipped and ready to treat COVID-19 patients,” said Jakub Jan Kakietek, Team Leader of The World Bank’s Tajikistan Emergency COVID-19 Project.
Thanks to its competitive processes, UNOPS procured high-quality items at competitive market rates, resulting in savings that will allow for additional procurements to the benefit of the Tajik people.
Background
In May 2020, amidst one of the worst global health crises ever experienced, UNOPS and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Population of the Republic of Tajikistan (MoHSPP) signed an agreement with US$5.3 million to support the Government in procuring and delivering lifesaving equipment and PPE to fight the COVID-19 disease to 10 key hospitals country-wide, benefiting approximately 1.8 million people in Tajikistan.
Funding from The World Bank, provided by a grant under the Tajikistan Emergency COVID-19 Project enabled the government to engage UNOPS in helping strengthen the capacity of the health sector in the capital and regions by providing technical support, procurement, delivery and distribution services of critical medical equipment and supplies.
With the funds, UNOPS is now strengthening the health sector capacity in the capital and regions by providing project management and procurement services for items and related technical support (assembly & calibration, training, warranty), organising delivery and distribution of items, and services.

Title: UNDP and Supreme Court of Republic of Tajikistan hold international online Judges’ Forum
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
15 October 2020
Judges, representatives of National Institute of Justice and UNDP Health, Governance and Human development specialists from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan will participate to address this year’s focus: criminalization of HIV exposure, transmission and non-disclosure. The EECA region, where almost all countries have laws that criminalize HIV exposure and transmission, is home to three of the world’s four “leaders” in terms of HIV prosecutions (Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine).
The majority of participants will be judges with experience in HIV-related cases and who understand human rights principles as a critical element to advancing HIV jurisprudence, as well as the judges who participated in last year’s Forum, held in Moldova.
“The Forum provides a platform for judges to discuss the latest scientific, medical and epidemiological evidence, international and regional guidance, and social and structural factors that increase the vulnerability of people living with HIV and key populations”, says Dr Rosemary Kumwenda, Regional Team Leader, Istanbul Regional Hub.
“We are excited to bring the judges together to compare judicial and legislative responses to HIV and related national, regional and international laws, and share experiences and challenges in their work with the protection of rights in the context of HIV and co-infections” says Dr Pratibha Mehta, Resident Representative, UNDP Tajikistan
The rate of new HIV infections is decreasing globally, but Eastern Europe and Central Asia is one of only three regions where the HIV epidemic continues to grow. Since 2010, new HIV infections have increased 72 percent, and AIDS-related deaths have increased by 4 percent. According to UNAIDS, there are approximately 1.7 million people living with HIV in the region. Most new infections in the region are among key populations, who must contend with punitive legal environments, social ostracization and discrimination.
While there have been significant improvements in the legal environment relevant to HIV and TB in the region, legal barriers persist, and key populations are still not sufficiently and effectively protected. Additionally, the legal, policy and regulatory frameworks that govern national efforts in prevention, treatment, care and support need significant strengthening. Some key obstacles include: criminalization of HIV transmission, non-disclosure and exposure; criminalization of sex work or introduction of increased punitive measures against sex workers; criminalization of drug use and/or possession for personal use; forced and coerced HIV testing and others.
Functional and effective judicial systems are imperative to ensure the protection of the rights of key populations. In this regard, the judiciary in a number of the EECA countries has been quite progressive also through important enabling court decisions.

11 September 2020
The handover ceremony was attended by representatives from WFP, the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan, the Ministry of Education and Science of Tajikistan and other partners.
“Thanks to the close partnership with the Government of Tajikistan and the Russian Federation, WFP helps the young generation through school meals to reach their full potential,” said WFP Tajikistan Representative and Country Director Alberto Correia Mendes. “We are extremely grateful for Russia’s considerable and consistent support, which has proven crucial in assisting schoolchildren.”
In 2019, more than 500,000 Tajik schoolchildren from grades 1 to 4 in 2,000 schools across 52 rural districts were served hot, nutritious soup or other local meals and a piece of traditional bread baked using WFP wheat flour.
The School Feeding Programme is WFP’s largest operation in Tajikistan and represents the organization’s strong commitment to changing lives. In vulnerable and food insecure communities, providing healthy food to children at school can means better nutrition, improved health as well as increased access to education.
In Tajikistan, WFP focuses on supporting development programmes that help strengthen institutional capacities. Since 1999, the organization has been partnering with the Government of Tajikistan to implement and manage school feeding in the country.
With the financial support of the Russian Federation, WFP, in cooperation with the Russian NGO Social and Industrial Foodservice Institute (SIFI), is working with the Tajik Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population and the Ministry of Education and Science towards the gradual transition of the School Feeding Programme to full national ownership starting from 2021.
The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies, building prosperity and supporting a sustainable future for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.
