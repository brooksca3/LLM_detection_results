Title: Government and Partners Call for Strengthened Partnership and Intensified Efforts Against Maternal and Neonatal Mortality Crisis
Content: 09 May 2024
Participants to the Maternal and Newborn Health Summit highlight the need to galvanize action to strengthen maternal and newborn health interventions, thereby contributing to the reduction of maternal, newborn and still births in Zambia.
LUSAKA, Zambia, 09 May 2024 – The Acting President of the Government of the Republic of Zambia, Her Honour Mrs. W.K Mutale Nalumango, called for renewed policy and financial commitments to save the lives of babies and mothers at the Maternal and Newborn Health Summit organised today in Lusaka by the Ministry of Health with support from key line ministries and cooperating partners.
Under the theme “Accelerating the Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Deaths in Zambia through Multi-Sectoral approach” the event presented an opportunity for the Government of the Republic of Zambia and partners to assess progress made in addressing maternal and newborn deaths.
Maternal mortality ratio has shown modest reduction every decade since year 2000. The facility maternal mortality ratio (MPDSR) has gone from 137 per 100,000 live births in 2020, to 123 in 2021 and to 118 in 2022. This progress highlights the efforts of the Government and partners in addressing the issue. Nevertheless, maternal mortality ratio remains unacceptably high, especially in some areas across the country.
Moreover, neonatal mortality rates have remained stagnant between 2020 and 2022, with a persistent rate of 24 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to UN Inter-agency Group data. Despite improvements in maternal and newborn health, there is still much work to be done to reduce the deaths as challenges persist in meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, Good Health and Wellbeing: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for at all ages, to be attained by 2030.
“The Maternal and Newborn Health Summit is a critical initiative in our ongoing efforts to reduce maternal, neonatal, and perinatal deaths in Zambia. Bringing together stakeholders from various sectors will be helpful in developing actionable strategies to overcome challenges faced in accessing quality maternal and newborn health care,” stated Her Honour, Mrs. W.K Mutale Nalumango.
In Zambia, a mother dies every 12 hours, a newborn dies every 30 minutes, and a stillbirth occurs every hour. In 2023 alone, 782 mothers and 16,000 newborns died, and 5,000 stillbirths were registered. Against this backdrop, the Maternal and Newborn Summit has drawn engagement and participation from all cooperating and implementing partners to review key indicators, provide recommendations for action, and map the way forward on partners’ support and collaboration.
"Ending preventable child and maternal deaths will require a coordinated effort between government, civil society, and the private sector to mitigate the three delays - delays in seeking care, delays in reaching care, and delays in receiving care. The United States will continue to work with you to find creative, affordable ways to connect more pregnant people to care during the most critical moments,” said U.S. Embassy Chargé d’Affaires, Linnisa Wahid.
The Maternal and Newborn Health summit participants discussed challenges contributing to maternal and neonatal deaths, particularly the three delays, namely, delay in seeking care, reaching care, and receiving care. Through collaborative efforts, stakeholders held sessions to discuss and develop strategies to overcome the identified barriers to care, improve access to quality maternal and newborn health care and refine resource mobilization efforts.
The United Nations Resident Coordinator, Beatrice Mutali, highlighted the need of concerted efforts to address maternal and newborn deaths. “The United Nations stands in solidarity with Zambia in its pursuit of improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. We believe that today’s deliberations will catalyse the momentum towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. We are committed to supporting the Government of the Republic of Zambia in improving access to healthcare services, particularly among the poor, and underprivileged populations and in underserved areas. We will continue to work with the Government, cooperating partners, civil society, the private sector, and communities themselves h to strengthen healthcare systems, improve the quality of care, and strengthen initiatives to promote healthy behaviours and improve care-seeking for health”.
Organized by the Ministry of Health in partnership with cooperating partners, the summit marks a significant step towards operationalizing the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH&N) roadmap and investment case.
The summit brought together the experts in the maternal and newborn health with policy makers to brainstorm on key issues and come forward with recommendations to improve health system for delivery of MNH interventions.
The World Bank Country Manager, Dr Achim Fock, who spoke on behalf of the Cooperating Partners, emphasized the importance of a multisectoral approach to addressing the challenges in RMNCAH&N.  “Zambia has a unique opportunity with roll out of decentralisation in the health sector whereby the needed multisectoral and multi-disciplinary actions can be most effective at community and local level. Local councils with the health leadership are already utilizing the Constituency Development Funds to build closer maternity clinics and investing in systems for transport for expectant mothers. Scaling this up and using the models that are already effective in some districts can be a game changer,” he said.
Some of the recommendations from the summit are to improve the healthcare system in Zambia by enhancing data-driven decision-making and implementing an effective Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System. Additionally, commitments are made to improve health related supply chain and logistics management, integrate quality improvement of RMNCAH&N services, and ensure community responsiveness of these services. Furthermore, to improve sustainability and access to healthcare by enhancing collaboration, linkages, and integration of service provision have been identified as key action. Finally, recommendations have been made to address the human resources gap and raise capacities to ensure a more effective and efficient healthcare system. By implementing these recommendations, Zambia will make significant strides in improving the health and well-being of its mothers and newborns.

Title: United Nations provides $5.5 million for Zambia’s Drought Response
Content: 26 April 2024
Lusaka, 26 April 2024
The United Nations (UN) has through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) activated an allocation of up to $5.5 million to support Zambia’s response to an unprecedented drought that has left about 7.5 million people in 84 districts in need of assistance, with the majority being women and children. The funding is subject to completion of necessary formalities by UN agencies in Zambia that are delivering as one in supporting the Government-led efforts to provide humanitarian and lifesaving assistance to affected populations.
The CERF funds will help in providing emergency food aid, distributing clean and safe water, protection, and delivering healthcare services to address drought-related health risks, among other needs. The support will also help to strengthen resilience in drought-affected communities to mitigate or avoid the humanitarian impacts of the drought and ensure that emergency relief enhances sustainability.
The Acting UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Penelope Campbell, has welcomed the support from CERF and underscored commitment by the United Nations in helping Zambia respond to the drought emergency.
“We stand in solidarity with the people of Zambia at this challenging time and are happy that CERF has initiated this emergency funding which will help alleviate the difficulties being faced because of the El Niño-induced drought. We commend President Hakainde Hichilema for declaring the drought emergency and further announcing an appeal as that enables the UN and other partners to mobilize support,” said Dr. Campbell.
The drought has significantly impacted eight (Central, Copperbelt, Eastern, Lusaka, Muchinga, North-Western, Southern and Western provinces) of the country’s 10 provinces. The most affected are Western, Southern, Central and Lusaka provinces. The most vulnerable groups directly affected include small-scale farmers that depend on rainfed agriculture, livestock herders, and individuals reliant on natural water bodies and shallow wells.

Title: Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence Against Children commends the strong commitment and efforts of the Government of Zambia to end Violence Against Children and stresses the need to invest more in child protection and well-being
Content: 15 April 2024
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) on Violence Against Children,Dr. Najat Maalla M’jid, concluded her first visit to Zambia at the invitation of the Government.
During this fruitful mission, the SRSG was accompanied by Honourable Doreen Mwamba, Minister of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS) and the UN Country team in Zambia.
Lusaka, 15 April – Throughout her 7-day mission, the SRSG had a first-hand engagement with the leadership of the country and stakeholders on efforts to end all forms of violence against children in Zambia, which is a Pathfinding country to end Violence Against Children since 2016.
The SRSG met with the Government and a variety of stakeholders including His Excellency the President, the Vice President, Cabinet Ministers, Provincial and District authorities, Members of the Parliament, House of Chiefs, Cooperating Partners, National Human Rights Commission, Civil Society Organizations, traditional leaders and media. She also undertook various on-site visits of programmes and institutions engaging directly with children, youth and women as well as front line social workers.
These interactions helped her explore areas of collaboration with the Government and partners to strengthen and scale up integrated child protection systems that are accessible to all children and their caregivers, leaving no child behind (children in street situations, children on the move, children with disabilities, children in conflict with the law, children living in poor and rural areas among others).
“The commitment and mobilization of the Government and all stakeholders I met during my visit, are clear,” stated the SRSG. During her meeting with His Excellency the President, Hakainde Hichilema, he reiterated his pledge to end child marriage and other forms of violence against children by 2030.
“Ending Violence Against Children is a priority for the Government of the Republic of Zambia. This country has a young population, so it is imperative to invest in children’s protection and well-being. What is at stake is the human capital of this country which is essential for its socio-economic development,” emphasized Hon. Doreen Mwamba, Minister of Community Development and Social Services.
The enactment of the Children’s Code Act, the amendment of the Marriage Act and the repealing of the Juveniles Act as well as various policies and programmes aiming at ensuring social protection, access to child and gender-sensitive education, health and justice, demonstrate this commitment.
Despite having progressive laws and policies that protect children from different forms of violence, Zambia is still experiencing challenges to ensure a protective environment. Violence against children remains a major concern and a daily reality for many children in Zambia. According to the Violence Against Children Study (2014). About 41 per cent of girls and 49 per cent of boys report having experienced or witnessed physical violence at household level and about 65 per cent of children indicate they have been bullied in school. Moreover, child marriage continues to have high prevalence with 29 per cent of girls and 2.8 per cent of boys married by age 18. Teenage pregnancy has remained stagnant at 29 per cent. There are also challenges with data availability and accessibility, coordination, and fragmentation of service provision.
”There is a need to accelerate the implementation of the Children’s Code Act to better coordinate the efforts, and to invest more in integrated child protection services which involve many sectors (social welfare, child protection, education, health, home affairs, labour, tourism and justice)  at central, provincial and district levels. Increased budget allocation for core child protection services is critical to address the insufficient numbers of social workers the country has. Prevention of violence makes economic sense as it will have high return on the development of the country.” highlighted the SRSG.
The SRSG also stressed the need to listen to and involve more children. “Children, who represent about 53 per cent of the population, cannot be seen as a problem to solve, but as an asset to invest in. And they must be part of the solution to end Violence Against Children. “
To conclude, the SRSG stated that less than six years remain to achieve the implementation of the 2030 Agenda – Sustainable Development Goals. “The clock is ticking!  Coordinated and sustainable actions to end Violence Against Children by 2030, are needed more than ever,” she highlighted while reiterating her support to the Government, in close collaboration with the UNCT.

Title: UN Coordinator for El Niño and UNICEF Regional Director Call for internatioal solidarity and support for drought-stricken Zambia
Content: 05 April 2024
Lusaka, 5 April 2024
Reena Ghelani, the UN Assistant Secretary General and Climate Crisis Coordinator for the El Niño / La Niña response and Eva Kadilli, UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, called for international solidarity and urged for concerted efforts to support the humanitarian response during their visit to Zambia, which concluded today.
Children and communities in Zambia need urgent support as the country faces a severe drought induced by El Niño, while still battling to recover from a historic cholera outbreak.
The UN representatives met with Government and local partners involved in ongoing efforts to address both the drought and the cholera outbreak and heard from communities and NGOs working on the frontlines of the humanitarian crisis.
“Communities affected by the drought need immediate support in terms of cash and food assistance. At the same time, we must help them become more resilient to climate shocks. The farmers we met who are using climate-smart techniques have been able to harvest some crops despite the drought. This shows us the importance of investing in climate adaptation for countries like Zambia that will face more frequent and severe droughts in the future,” warned Reena Ghelani.
This mission followed a recent declaration by President Hakainde Hichilema of a State of Emergency and National Disaster, noting that 84 of the country’s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and 1 million acres of crops, about half the country’s planted area, had been destroyed.
Experts have warned that the drought will impact food production and electricity generation. Communities in Zambia rely mainly on hydropower, and its consequences could last until the end of the lean season in early 2025. The crisis could have regional implications as well, because Zambia is a major maize exporter in the region.
The Zambian Government has reported over 22,400 cholera cases since last year and more than 720 deaths. Over 8 million people are exposed to severe and intense drought and 6 million people are at risk of food insecurity, who are to be targeted in the response according to the El Niño Impact assessment, with about 40,000 people facing emergency levels of food insecurity.
“Children are the most impacted by climate shocks, and the impacts of El Niño in the region have been devastating. In Zambia, a large number of the population in need, about 3 million, are children. Throughout the visit, we have been able to interact with community members, including female farmers. They are worried for their children as the drought could lead to an increase in malnutrition cases.  This will require immediate attention and UNICEF is ready to scale up our response in country, in coordination with the Government, the UN family and partners,” said Eva Kadilli.
Preliminary assessments indicate that over half of households surveyed have either no food stock left or less than one month supply available, and that more than 57 per cent of households assessed are already employing crisis and emergency level coping strategies.
The United Nations in Zambia has put together a multi-hazard preparedness and response plan to support Government-led efforts, and is calling upon international partners to join forces with the UN, to be able to provide emergency assistance and boost preventive measures and sustainable recovery.

Title: United Nations Responds to Zambia’s Drought Disaster and Emergency
Content: 04 March 2024
Lusaka, 4 March 2024
In response to the Presidential declaration of the drought national disaster and emergency in Zambia, the United Nations (UN) is working with the Government in preparing a drought response plan to support affected households in 84 severely affected districts across seven provinces.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Beatrice Mutali, says the UN family has been getting ready to support Zambia and recently developed a Multi-hazard Preparedness and Response Plan to help the country to navigate challenges posed by the onset of El Niño conditions and climate change, as well as the unprecedented cholera outbreak ongoing.
“With the drought response plan, we expect the government to launch a humanitarian appeal that we hope will enable us to mobilize about USD30 million to provide humanitarian support, livelihoods recovery, and resilience building for the over 1 million households of which a significant number are children, at risk of food insecurity, acute malnutrition, and disease,” Ms Mutali said.
The dry spell has from mid-January this year affected most of the central and southern half of the country, that has received less than normal rainfall leaving 1 million hectares of maize destroyed, almost half of the country’s maize cultivation. It is also projected that the drought will lead to a power deficit or 430 Megawatts and affect ground and surface water levels, with severe consequences for sectors beyond agriculture since +80 per cent of Zambia electricity generation comes from hydropower.

Title: United Nations provides $2.5 million to fight cholera in Zambia
Content: 01 February 2024
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Lusaka, 1 February 2024 - The United Nations (UN) has allocated $2.5 million in response to the cholera outbreak in Zambia. The funds, provided by the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), will be used to support efforts by the Government in controlling the further spread of the disease.
As of 30 January 2024, a total of 16,258 cases were reported, including 606 deaths since the outbreak started in October last year, according to the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZHPHI).
The CERF funds will help cholera case management at health facility level and access to water and sanitation at homes, schools, and health facilities in the most affected areas. Other activities to be prioritized are awareness raising and community engagement through training and deployment of community-based volunteers. Additionally, the funding will support the protection of key groups, particularly women and girls, who might face the risk of experiencing gender-based violence and sexual exploitation as secondary impacts.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Beatrice Mutali, has pledged continued UN support to helping Zambia respond to the emergency.
“We are grateful to CERF for providing emergency funding in a speedy manner. As the UN in Zambia we are here to support all the way. We are on the ground, through UNICEF and WHO as technical leads with other agencies supporting and Delivering as One to help the Government fight this cholera outbreak,” said Ms Mutali.
Through WHO and UNICEF, the UN recently provided 1.7 million vaccines to Zambia, deployed 26 experts and made available more than $600,000 through core funds to support the Government’s immediate cholera response.
The other support provided included the provision of 320,000 sachets of Oral Rehydration Solution, nearly 6,000 test kits, chlorine, soap and personal protective equipment, among other critical supplies.
Zambia is facing an unprecedent cholera outbreak, with the fatality rate around
four percent, and children aged below five years being disproportionately affected. The current outbreak has the capital city Lusaka as the epicentre and has been also fueled by the floods occurring in many parts of the country.

Title: UNICEF and UNESCO sound call for commitment to ensure safe re-opening of schools as world commemorates International Day of Education
Content: 24 January 2024
Lusaka, 24 January 2024
UNICEF and UNESCO called on the Government of the Republic of Zambia to ensure safe re-opening of schools on 29 January.as the country continues to respond to the Cholera outbreak which has affected more than 13,000 people, and necessitated a delay in the re-opening of schools for the 2024 school calendar.
“As we mark the International Day of Education which falls today, 24th January, we emphasize the dual significance of education: for children to reach their full potential and for Zambia's critical human capital, pivotal for socio-economic development. Now, more than ever, keeping children in school is paramount. During challenges like climatic shocks and health emergencies, such as the current cholera outbreak, maintaining education safeguards children from additional risks, reinforcing the urgency of our commitment to their continuous learning and our nation's resilient future,” said UNICEF Zambia Country Representative, Dr Penelope Campbell.
“Today’s children are facing a global learning crisis of startling proportions: the data shows us that, in Sub Saharan Africa specifically, 9 out of 10 children cannot read or understand a simple text by the age of 10,” said United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Team Lead, Alice Saili. “The introduction of free education in Zambia in 2022 and the subsequent teacher recruitment exercise of over 4,000 teachers in 2023 was a first step towards mitigating the global learning crisis within the Zambian context. However, there remains a need for greater investment in education – including towards the infrastructure that will ensure schools are resilient in the event of public health emergencies such as we are currently facing. The future of Zambia’s children rests on the commitments and actions that we take today.”
Owing to the current cholera outbreak, over 10,000 schools remain closed in what should have been the first three weeks of the new school year in 2024. This has prompted concerns about educational progress for children who were already behind due to pandemic-related school closures which increased the learning poverty rate from around 86% pre-Covid to an estimated 90 per cent in low- and middle-income countries.
To turn the tide, the African Union will, at its annual summit in February, declare and adopt 2024 as the Year of Education on the theme “Educate an African fit for the 21st Century:  Building resilient education systems for increased access to inclusive, lifelong, quality, and relevant learning in Africa”.
The objective of the summit is to re-galvanize Member States towards the achievement of the Continental Education Strategy for Africa and SDG4 – Quality Education targets. The summit comes as a follow-up to the UN Secretary General’s Vision Statement on Transforming Education in 2022, among other calls for action. It will engage the AU Commission to mobilize governments and development partners to rethink the models of education and skills development needed for Africa.
“Without inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong opportunities for all, countries will not succeed in achieving gender equality and breaking the cycle of poverty that is leaving millions of children, youth and adults behind,” stated Dr Campbell.

Title: Zambia joins clarion call to end Gender Based Violence in Southern Africa
Content: 13 October 2023
Lusaka, 13 October 2023
The United Nations (UN) in Zambia has joined other UN teams in five Southern African countries in preparing a five-year program aimed at eliminating Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Southern Africa, alongside Governments, Partners and Civil Society organizations.
The intervention comes amidst revelations that an estimated 33 percent of women in Southern Africa have experienced Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in their lifetime, compared to the global 27 percent. These statistics have stirred up countries in the sub-region to escalate an innovative and whole-of-society approach of response and preventive measures against GBV in the region.
Speaking during a satellite meeting held in Lusaka for the High-Level Partnership Rountable meeting in Pretoria on 10 October 2023, Gender Division Permanent Secretary Ms Mainga Kabika appreciated support from the governments of Ireland and Sweden, United Kingdom, the United States of America as well as the European Union in addressing GBV. She noted the GBV is a human rights violation that impacts development.
“We must recognize that Gender-Based Violence is a human rights violation that impedes social progress, economic development, and the achievement of sustainable development goals. Our collective response as governments must strive to be holistic, inclusive, and multi-faceted,” she said.
Speaking at the Pretoria meeting that brought together six UN Country Teams, Governments, cooperating partners and civil society organizations from the six countries - Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia, the UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Ms Beatrice Mutali, called for a more intensive and concerted approach by all to push for concrete changes to help fight GBV.
“We have the full support of the UN Secretary General, who included the fight against GBV and the Spotlight Initiative as one of the 12 High Impact initiatives aimed at demonstrating that transformative progress is possible despite challenging global circumstances to achieve the SDGs by 2030. We all need to do our part, through targeted communications and key messages that will drive positive behaviour change in Southern Africa,” she said.
Ms Mutali said that the worrying statistics indicate that Southern African is a leading sub-region on the continent with disturbingly high GBV prevalence and that advocacy and communication at various levels need to be heightened for effective behavioural change.
Meanwhile Chairperson of the Partnership Roundtable UN Resident Coordinator for Lesotho, Ms Amanda Mukwashi lamented the daily violence that women and girls face, which remains a “footnote in development” and relegated to a social development that is not considered as a big-ticket item such as the economy, natural resources and governance.
In a bid to demystify GBV by giving a voice to GBV Survivors, participants heard testimonies from South Africa, Eswatini, Namibia and Zambia that revealed the need to break the silence and cultural norms which contribute to perpetuating GBV.
The meeting demonstrated a linkage between development and GBV, poverty and GBV, which must be eliminated if women are to become free. The correlation was made by the Guest of Honour, Honourable Minister of Women, Youths and Disabilities for South Africa, Ms Nkosazana Dlamini. “Because we have created an environment of dependency, where women depend on men for survival and in a case where women decide to separate from this dependency, they often become victims of GBV,” Ms Dlamini-Zuma said.
The call for a systemic and wholesome approach to end GBV, which was made at the High Level Partner Sub-Regional meeting, is timely with the launch of the five-year anti-GBV programme that builds on the experiences and lessons learned from the previous Spotlight Initiative and focusses on transformative pillars of action such as human rights-based approach, leaving no one behind, national capacity and ownership, and a whole-system approach.
This, according to Ms Beatrice Mutali, is an approach that must be embraced because it focuses “on implementing the principle of Leave No One Behind by ensuring the inclusion of Persons with Disabilities and other marginalised and underserved populations”.
Citing her government’s commitment to continued partnership in fighting GBV, the Irish Ambassador to Zambia and Namibia, Ms Bronagh Carr, who spoke through a video message, noted that GBV was a core priority for Ireland.

“The task we have ahead is immense and will require all our inputs and all of our support. The focus must be on changing attitudes, gender roles and stereotypes, it means making violence against women and girls unacceptable. Lessons learnt in the previous Spotlight Initiative must be well articulated and disseminated,” Ambassador Carr said, who called for ensuring that prevention was at the heart of the intervention.

Other Cooperating Partners whose voices were heard in support of the Joint Initiative include the European Union, the United States of America, Canada and France. Those present in the satellite meeting in Lusaka included Zambia’s Permanent Secretary for Gender, Ms Mainga Kabika, representatives from the embassies of Ireland and Sweden, FDCO, USAID, academia, NGOs, people with disabilities, women and youth group leaders.

Title: United Nations Zambia to host SDGs Run in Lusaka to mark UN Day
Content: 02 October 2023
Lusaka, 2 October 2023
The United Nations in Zambia will on Saturday 28 October 2023 hold a 5km and 10km awareness run dubbed ‘Run for the SDGs’ to create awareness about the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are fully embedded in Zambia’s 8th National Development Plan and inspire action in support of these development goals. The event, which will take place at the Agricultural Showgrounds in Lusaka, shall be open to the public with no participation fee required.
Speaking during a media briefing held this morning at the UN House, UNICEF Zambia Representative and Co-Chair of the UN Communication Group (UNCG), Ms Penelope Campbell, called for concerted efforts in the attainment of the SDGs.
“We want to inspire individual, family and community action in support of the SDGs in Zambia through any kind of action, no matter how small. Together we can make a difference as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development requires a whole of society approach. It is not just a responsibility of government, the UN, or NGOs. It is a responsibility of all of us to be aware of and to make a difference,” said Campbell.
Ms Campbell added the importance of accelerating actions for the SDGs.
“Since we are at mid-point to the year 2030 with only seven more years to go, we need to accelerate actions at all levels across society. Achievement of the SDGs has been hampered but there is hope that we can rescue the SDGs by 2030,” she said.
And UNESCO Zambia Team Leader Alice Saili who is also Co-Chair of the UNCG said that the 2023 UN Day commemorations will include educational outreach to colleges and universities.
“Apart from a Social Media campaign and different sports and activities by UN staff and partners, we will also have dialogues with students in colleges and universities. Young people are very resourceful in terms of the actions to be taken around the SDGs. Young people need to be involved and allowed to bring their energy, innovation and creativity to support the Agenda for Sustainable Development,” said Ms Saili.
United Nations Day, on 24 October, marks the anniversary of the entry into force in 1945 of the UN Charter. With the ratification of this founding document by the majority of its signatories, including the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United Nations officially came into being. The UN in Zambia commemorates this day through various activities to share key messages about the work of the UN and reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN Charter that have guided UN work for the past 77 years.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States (including Zambia) in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

Title: PRESS RELEASE
Content: 19 May 2023
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Finally Launched – Forensic DNA Lab to Bridge Unresolved GBV Cases
Lusaka, 18 May 2023 – The United Nations in Zambia, in partnership with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal Security and supported by the American Government in Zambia, has launched a Forensic DNA Laboratory under the National Forensic Science and Biometrics Department that will offer the state-of-the-art analysis of DNA evidence in the resolution of sexual and other violent crimes, especially those perpetrated against children, women and other vulnerable groups.
Speaking at the launch on 16 May, the UN Resident Representative, Ms Beatrice Mutali said, “the establishment of this DNA Lab is a big and important step in our efforts to decrease the number of genuine cases lost in the judicial system as DNA is a powerful investigative tool. Therefore, strengthening the forensic system in Zambia is a big gamechanger for women and girls who fall victim to sexual offences,”
The UN Resident Coordinator underscored that the establishment of this DNA Lab is a big and important step in decreasing the number of genuine cases lost in the judicial system as DNA is a powerful investigative tool. Therefore, strengthening the forensic system in Zambia is a big gamechanger for women and girls who fall victim to sexual offences. The lab, which will be hosted by Levy Mwanawasa Medical University (LMMU), is the missing link in many sexual and gender based violent cases in Zambia. The forensic DNA evidence will annul the major setbacks in obtaining the much-needed justice for survivors of rape and Gender-Based Violence (GBV). With the establishment of the Forensic DNA laboratory, witness and survivor statements regarding the crime will now be corroborated by the DNA evidence.
The Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security Honourable Jack Mwiimbu, who was present at the launch and welcomed the Forensic DNA Lab as a development that has led the Government of the Republic of Zambia to re-commit itself to the national zero tolerance to GBV, “with the opening of the Forensic DNA laboratory, the Government of the Republic of Zambia re-comits itself to the national zero tolerance of GBV and to improve quality access to GBV response services”.
The Forensic DNA Laboratory, which is managed by the National Forensic Science and Biometrics Department, will categorize traces, isolate DNA, quantify and multiply DNA, and to profile/analyze the DNA. It is a Lab that expects to prioritize the examination of evidential material from the cases of SGBV, in order to support the investigations and resolution of these cases by the Zambia Police Service. The Forensic DNA Laboratory will also work with the; Zambia Police Service officers, and the medical officers from the Ministry of Health who handle evidential material for DNA analysis, in ensuring that the identification, collection, packaging, storage and transportation of the evidential material attain the acceptable International standards. Already 30 cases have been processed successfully and enabling conclusive investigations.
The United States through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their cooperating partner, the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), supported the acquisition of the equipment for Forensic DNA analysis valued whilst the United Nations in Zambia with the support of its cooperating partners, contributed to the partitioning of the Laboratory’s office space, procurement and installation of the air-conditioning systems, and the procurement of the first batch of reagents for DNA analysis.
Through the GRZ-UN Joint programme on GBV Phase II that involves UNDP, IOM, ILO, UNFPA and UNICEF, the UN in Zambia has been supporting the Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal Security on prevention and response to GBV services. This has been made possible through support from the Governments of Ireland and Sweden.
The UN System in Zambia remains committed in the fight against GBV, which has been included as an important theme in our new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2027, to ensure continued work towards the achievement of gender equality as well as elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls ensuring access to justice, in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Title: News Release- UN experts concerned over delay in Zambia’s debt restructuring
Content: 18 April 2023
GENEVA (17 April 2023): UN experts* are deeply concerned over delays in reaching an agreement on the restructuring of Zambia’s debt and its corresponding negative human rights impact on peoples’ lives.
“We are worried that despite positive reforms undertaken by the Government of Zambia, the delays in sovereign debt restructuring compromise its ability to mobilise and maximise resources for the full realisation of human rights, as per its obligations under international human rights law,” the experts said.
In August 2022, Zambia secured a 38-month Extended Credit Facility of USD 1.3 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At the end of its first review of this programme on 6 April 2023, the IMF Mission recognised the country’s progress as a result of robust structural fiscal and other reforms. However, continued delays on debt restructuring pose real risks for retrogression, including with respect to the country’s economic transformation agenda and aspirations for a better standard of living for its people.
The experts said that while social spending had increased, the economic dividends of sustained reforms and debt relief will go much further in creating the conditions and opportunities on which Zambia’s population can capitalise.
As per a 2022 UNDP report, more than 54 low-and middle-income countries are under critical debt distress and need urgent relief. Debt burden and prioritisation of debt servicing leads to austerity driven policies contravening international human rights obligations of States including their right to restructure sovereign debt.
The experts urged the Official Creditor Committee for Zambia to aim for and share a concrete timeframe for the conclusion of its deliberations.
“One of the major reasons for this delay in debt restructuring is the lack of a globally coordinated multilateral sovereign debt mechanism that places traditional and private lenders at an equal footing,” the experts said. “Despite the proactive steps taken by Zambia, undoubtedly the delay will affect the efficacy of the credit facility programme. There is a window of opportunity in 2023 to enable Zambia and its people to consolidate recent successes and all of Zambia’s partners must step-up,” they said.
The experts called for a multilateral sovereign debt mechanism under the UN guided by existing human rights frameworks and principles to ensure a rights-aligned recovery for countries suffering from debt distress and a reduced fiscal space.
The experts are in dialogue with relevant stakeholders, including private lenders, concerning the impact of the unsustainable sovereign debt level on the country’s ability to ensure the realisation of human rights of its population.

Title: WHO Zambia releases USD285,000 to support Cholera Response in Eastern Province
Content: 28 February 2023
WHO Zambia is working with National, Provincial and District partners to tackle the cholera outbreak that has spread across Vubwi, Chipata, Chipangali and Lusangazi districts of Eastern Province
Lusaka, 28 February 2023 – The World Health Organization (WHO) in Zambia has released USD285,000 to support the ongoing response to the cholera outbreak in Eastern Province. Since the outbreak was announced by the Minister of Health on January 26, 2023, a total of 191 suspected cases of cholera, including 4 deaths have been reported.
As part of the outbreak response, WHO Zambia is working with the Ministry of Health at National, Provincial and District levels, including the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) to rapidly put in in place interventions that will protect people and limit the spread of the outbreak to other districts across the province.
“Cholera outbreaks are of great concern to us, and especially that cholera is preventable, and Zambia has the right preventative tools in place. As WHO in Zambia we will continue to support the Ministry of Health in implementing immediate and long-term cholera control, response, and preventive measures. The funds released will help ensure that lives continue to be saved, and a resilient health system is maintained during and beyond the current outbreak," says Dr Nathan Bakyaita, WHO Representative in Zambia.
The funds released will allow WHO Zambia and partners to scale up priority response activities to effectively monitor and control the outbreak by:
“Eastern Province is uniquely positioned as some of the affected districts border Malawi and Mozambique, which too, have Cholera outbreaks, putting the whole province at high risk. For us to ensure we control and end the outbreak, we need to ensure that integrated critical tools of preparedness, response and prevention are in place. We need to enhance surveillance, care delivery and strengthen coordination and joint response at all levels,” added Dr Bakyaita.
Since the declaration of a cholera outbreak in January 2023, WHO has been working closely with the Ministry of Health to support deployment of surge staff and provide logistical support in the affected districts.

Title: United Nations Supports Sustainable Development Efforts in Zambia
Content: 24 February 2023
Lusaka, 23 February 2023
The United Nations in Zambia has called for wider stakeholder involvement in ensuring sustainable development and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Zambia. Speaking at a Joint SDG Fund event in Lusaka on 22 February, UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Beatrice Mutali said that all stakeholders should work towards economic transformation for the benefit of the people of Zambia.
Over 150 participants that included representatives of diplomatic missions, Government ministries, private Sector, think tanks, Civil Society and youth attended the event that showcased key results achieved through the Zambia Integrated National Financing Framework for SDGs joint programme, which the UN has implemented since June 2020 to support sustainable development in Zambia.
Ms Mutali said this in a speech read on her behalf by International Labour Organization (ILO) Director for Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique, Mr. George Okutho.
“We cannot continue with business as usual in our planning and implementation processes anymore but enhance efficiency and effectiveness of our interventions in addressing challenges to achieve the desired impact to drive the much-needed transformation to improve the lives of the people of Zambia,” Ms Mutali said.
Speaking at the same event, Minister of Finance and National Planning Dr Situmbeko Musokotwane appealed for innovative approaches for development financing to ensure progress on the SDGs. In a speech read on his behalf by Permanent Secretary for Planning and Administration, Ms Lois Mulube, Dr Musokotwane said that the Government had put in place several interventions in various sectors to support attainment of the SDGs in Zambia. He also paid tribute to the United Nations for supporting the Government’s development aspirations, as outlined in Zambia’s Vision 2030.
“We appreciate the support rendered to the Government by the UN Family through the Fund in supporting budget and expenditure analysis including facilitating stakeholder engagement; a study on implementation of the decentralization policy with a focus on fiscal decentralization; development of sector financing plans including the costing of key programmes; public expenditure reviews of the social protection sector whose findings fed into the development of the sector financing strategies in social protection; and undertaking the 2022 Census of Population and Housing,” Dr Musokotwane said.
To promote alternative financing for sustainable development in the country, the UN in Zambia has through five of its agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, ILO and UNECA) supported capacity development of the Government of the Republic of Zambia in planning processes and overcoming existing impediments to financing its national development priorities, including the SDGs.
This programme was intended to provide catalytic support to the Government in advancing SDG implementation in the country. Amongst other things, the Fund contributed to the following:
Other interventions included supporting the Rapid Integrated Assessment (RIA) of the Eighth National Development Plan, preparation of the Development Finance Assessment, National Budget Analyses as well as strengthening the capacity of Parliamentarians and Permanent secretaries in budget analysis.

Title: Zambia Police receives funding from the Elsie Initiative Fund to increase women’s participation in United Nations peace operations
Content: 07 February 2023
New York, 7 February 2023
The Elsie Initiative Fund for Uniformed Women in Peace Operations (EIF) announced today that the Zambia Police Service (ZPS) will receive funding of USD 932,072 to create a more enabling institutional environment to increase uniformed women’s participation in United Nations (UN) peace operations.
Zambia, one of the top 25 highest contributors of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping, was amongst the seven countries that piloted an assessment study in 2020 to identify barriers to women’s participation in UN peace operations, using the Measuring Opportunities for Women in Peace Operations (MOWIP) methodology developed by the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance.
Built on findings and recommendations from the 2020 MOWIP study, the ZPS project is designed to address several barriers identified at the strategic and policy levels. The project will address the lack of suitable peace operations accommodation infrastructure for women police officers; additionally, it will aim to strengthen the capacity of women police officers through a number of activities designed to address the lack of available information on deployments, household constraints, and socio-cultural barriers that continue to deter women’s meaningful participation.
Specifically, the ZPS project involves the construction of an accommodation facility for women (40 beds) and a daycare center (15 places) to enable women to fully participate in peacekeeping training. In addition, the ZPS project has been designed to foster a more gender-sensitive institutional culture through the development of an Anti-Sexual Harassment, Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) policy and the roll out of SEA training and gender-mainstreaming workshops to senior Zambia Police personnel. Importantly, the ZPS will also train and expand its network of regional focal points to systematically disseminate deployment related information, particularly in rural and remote areas. Upon completion of the project, the ZPS aims to create a roster with over 100 women eligible to deploy as peacekeepers.
Over the years, Zambia has made great strides in promoting the rights of women and ensuring their equal participation in peace and security. In 2014, Zambia adopted a revised National Gender Policy and enacted a Gender Equality Act in 2015. Under a bilateral partnership with Canada, Zambia is currently developing a ZPS Gender Policy in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
“My Command appreciates the recognition of female officers as a ‘catalyst of systematic change within the Zambia Police Service. As Command, therefore, we take very seriously our role in driving policy reforms, ensuring gender mainstreaming and accountability for gender equality and women’s empowerment within our institution. I wish to assure you all of our continued commitment to do so” said the Inspector General of Police Lemmy Kajoba.
In close partnership with the ZPS, this project will be managed and implemented by UNDP in Zambia. Senior ZPS and UNDP representatives will co-chair the Project Oversight Committee and provide strategic guidance to ensure successful implementation. This project will also leverage existing ZPS Women’s and Men’s Networks and ensure their voices are represented throughout the project cycle.
Committed to ensuring the sustainability of these project outcomes, the ZPS has also committed to ensure that gender-related training is institutionalized within the police training curriculum, and to continue to fund, train and prepare police officers, in particular women, for deployment to UN peace operations.
*** About the Elsie Initiative Fund (EIF) Established by the UN, Canada, and Member States in 2019, the EIF is an innovative, multilateral fund that aims to accelerate progress towards the UN's gender targets in line with Security Council resolutions and the UN Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy 2018-2028. The EIF, a UN trust fund hosted by UN Women, is funded by contributions from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom.

Title: Inequalities are blocking the end of the AIDS pandemic, say UN
Content: 29 November 2022
GENEVA, 29 November 2022—Analysis by the UN ahead of World AIDS Day reveals that inequalities are obstructing the end of AIDS. On current trends the world will not meet agreed global targets on AIDS. But the new UNAIDS report, Dangerous Inequalities, shows that urgent action to tackle inequalities can get the AIDS response on track.
UNAIDS set out earlier this year that the AIDS response is in danger—with rising new infections and continuing deaths in many parts of the world. Now, a new report from UNAIDS shows that inequalities are the underlying reason why. It shows how world leaders can tackle those inequalities, and calls on them to be courageous to follow what the evidence reveals.
Dangerous Inequalities unpacks the impact on the AIDS response of gender inequalities, of inequalities faced by key populations, and of inequalities between children and adults. It sets out how worsening financial constraints are making it more difficult to address those inequalities.
The report shows how gender inequalities and harmful gender norms are holding back the end of the AIDS pandemic.
“The world will not be able defeat AIDS while reinforcing patriarchy,” said UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. “We need to address the intersecting inequalities women face. In areas of high HIV burden, women subjected to intimate partner violence face up to a 50% higher chance of acquiring HIV. Across 33 countries from 2015-2021 only 41% of married women aged 15-24 could make their own decisions on sexual health. The only effective route map to ending AIDS, achieving the sustainable development goals and ensuring health, rights and shared prosperity, is a feminist route map. Women’s rights organizations and movements are already on the frontlines doing this bold work. Leaders need to support them and learn from them.”
The effects of gender inequalities on women’s HIV risks are especially pronounced in sub- Saharan Africa, where women accounted for 63% of new HIV infections in 2021.
Adolescent girls and young women (aged 15 to 24 years) are three times more likely to acquire HIV than adolescent boys and young men of the same age group in sub-Saharan Africa. The driving factor is power. One study showed that enabling girls to stay in school until they complete secondary education reduces their vulnerability to HIV infection by up to 50%. When this is reinforced with a package of empowerment support, girls’ risks are reduced even further. Leaders need to ensure all girls are in school, are protected from violence which is often normalized including through underage marriages, and have economic pathways that guarantee them a hopeful future.
By interrupting the power dynamics, policies can reduce girls’ vulnerability to HIV.
Harmful masculinities are discouraging men from seeking care. While 80% of women living with HIV were accessing treatment in 2021, only 70% of men were on treatment. Increasing gender- transformative programming in many parts of the world is key to halting the pandemic. Advancing gender equality will benefit everyone.
2 0 3 0  |  E n d i n g  t h e  A I D S  e p i d e m i c
The report shows that the AIDS response is being held back by inequalities in access to treatment between adults and children. While over three quarters of adults living with HIV are on antiretroviral therapy, just over half of children living with HIV are on the lifesaving medicine. This has had deadly consequences. In 2021, children accounted for only 4% of all people living with HIV but 15% of all AIDS-related deaths. Closing the treatment gap for children will save lives.
Discrimination against, stigmatization and criminalization of key populations are costing lives and preventing the world from achieving agreed AIDS targets.
New analysis shows no significant decline in new infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men in both the western and central Africa and eastern and southern Africa regions. Facing an infectious virus, failure to make progress on key populations undermines the entire AIDS response and helps explain slowing progress.
Around the world, over 68 countries still criminalize same sex sexual relations. Another analysis highlighted in the report found that gay men and other men who have sex with men who live in African countries with the most repressive laws are more than three times less likely to know their HIV status than their counterparts living in countries with the least repressive laws, where progress as far more rapid. Sex workers who live in countries where sex work is criminalized have a 7 times greater chance to be living with HIV than in countries where sex work is legal or partially legalized.
The report shows progress against inequalities is possible and highlights areas where the AIDS response has made remarkable progress. For example, while surveys among key populations often highlight lower service coverage among key populations, three counties in Kenya have achieved higher HIV treatment coverage among female sex workers than among the general population of women (aged 15-49 years). This has been helped by strong HIV programming over many years, including community-led services.
“We know what to do to end inequalities,” said Ms Byanyima. “Ensure that all of our girls are in school, safe and strong. Tackle gender based violence. Support women’s organisations. Promote healthy masculinities—to take the place of the harmful behaviours which exacerbate risks for everyone. Ensure services for children living with HIV reach them and meet their needs, closing the treatment gap so that we end AIDS in children for good. Decriminalize people in same-sex relationships, sex workers, and people who use drugs, and invest in community-led services that enable their inclusion — this will help break down barriers to services and care for millions of people.”
The new report shows donor funding is helping catalyse increased domestic funding: increases in external HIV funding for countries from PEPFAR and the Global Fund during 2018-2021 were correlated with increases in domestic funding from a majority of national governments. New investments to address HIV-related inequalities are urgently needed. At a moment when international solidarity and a surge of funding is most needed, too many high-income countries are cutting back aid for global health. In 2021, funding available for HIV programmes in low- and middle-income countries was US$ 8 billion short. Increasing donor support is vital to getting the AIDS response back on track.
Budgets need to prioritize the health and well-being of all people, especially vulnerable populations that are most affected by HIV-related inequalities. Fiscal space for health investments in low- and middle-income countries needs to be expanded, including through substantial debt cancellation and through progressive taxation. Ending AIDS is far less expensive than not ending AIDS.
In 2021, 650 000 people were lost to AIDS and 1.5 million people newly acquired HIV.
“What world leaders need to do is crystal clear,” said Ms Byanyima. “In one word: Equalize. Equalize access to rights, equalize access to services, equalize access to the best science and medicine. Equalizing will not only help the marginalised. It will help everyone.”

Title: Zambia-UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework Launched
Content: 05 November 2022
Lusaka, 4 November 2022
Her Honour the Vice President of the Republic of Zambia,
Mrs. W.K. Mutale Nalumango, today launched the Government of Zambia-United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, that defines United Nations support to Zambia’s development for the period 2023-2027. The Cooperation Framework is aimed at supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and delivering the 2030 Agenda in an integrated manner, as well as to support the country’s development priorities as outlined in the Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP).
The Cooperation Framework was co-signed by Her Honour the Vice President on behalf of the Zambian Government and by Ms Mutali on behalf of the United Nations System in Zambia.
The German Ambassador to Zambia H.E. Anne Wagner-Mitchell represented the Cooperating Partners Group, and emphasized the importance of this historic ceremony, as well as the UN Reform.
Speaking at the ceremony, that was witnessed by over 300 guests that included Government officials, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Heads of UN Agencies and staff, Civil Society, and the media, the Vice President noted continued commitment by the United Nations in the improvement of the lives of the Zambian people and the value of the Cooperation Framework in the country’s development.
“The Zambian people value the support and partnership of the United Nations towards Zambia’s development agenda. This new Cooperation Framework is welcome because it will complement Zambia’s development agenda as contained in the recently launched Eight National Development Plan,” said Mrs Nalumango.
The Vice President also called on both the Zambian Government and the United Nations to ensure successful implementation of the Cooperation Framework.
For her part, Ms Mutali underscored the importance of ownership and partnership to ensure the success of the Cooperation Framework.
“The Cooperation Framework does not belong to the United Nations. It is a joint commitment by the Government of the Republic of Zambia and the United Nations to work in close partnership, with the support of cooperating partners and other key stakeholders, including civil society, to contribute to ensuring better lives for the people of Zambia,” she said.
Through the work of 23 UN agencies in Zambia, the new Cooperation Framework will provide interventions across four pillars, namely Prosperity, People, Peace, and Planet which align to the four strategic Priority Areas of the 8NDP. It will be implemented based on the core principles on the United Nations which are Leaving no One Behind, Human Rights, Gender Equality and Women’s empowerment, sustainability and Resilience and Accountability.
The Cooperation Framework was formulated through a consultative process with the involvement of UN agencies, Government, Civil Society, Private Sector, Development Partners, Academia, Trade Unions, and Regional Bodies, among other stakeholders.
In the spirit of Leaving No One Behind, several groups were also extensively consulted which included the youth, women, refugees, former refugees, immediate host communities, migrants, Persons with Disabilities, People Living with HIV/AIDS and key populations, among others.
Implemented following UN General Assembly resolution 72/279, the Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework is a strategic, medium-term results framework that describes the collective vision in support of national development priorities and results.

Title: Heads of State commit to Noncommunicable Disease Global Compact to save 50 million lives by 2030
Content: 21 September 2022
21 September 2022
Today, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, launched a new report calling on global leaders to take urgent action on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), responsible for 17 million premature deaths every year.
To accelerate action Dr Tedros renewed the two-year appointment of Michael R. Bloomberg as WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. This is Bloomberg’s third reappointment as Ambassador, having first been appointed to the role in 2016.
The announcement came at the first annual gathering of a Heads of State and Government Group for the Prevention of NCDs, led by the President of Ghana and the Prime Minister of Norway, held during the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). This follows the launch of a Global NCD Compact earlier this year by Ghana and Norway.
To mark the occasion, WHO released a new report, “Invisible Numbers: The true scale of noncommunicable diseases,” and a data portal that for the first time, brings together all WHO data related to NCDs for 194 countries. The report and portal highlight the extent of global NCD burden, risk factors, and the progress each country is making in their efforts to combat these diseases and conditions. Every two seconds, someone under 70 somewhere in the world dies of an NCD. Noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and lung disease now outnumber infectious disease as the top killers globally.
“This report is a reminder of the true scale of the threat posed by NCDs and their risk factors,” said Dr Tedros. “There are cost-effective and globally applicable NCD interventions that every country, no matter its income level, can and should be using and benefitting from – saving lives and saving money. I thank President Afuko-Addo, Prime Minister Støre and Michael Bloomberg for their leadership and vision in addressing this major global health issue.”
Bloomberg’s reappointment comes at a critical juncture for public health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people living with NCDs faced worse outcomes than those without. Today, Gallup released a new survey commissioned by WHO and Bloomberg Philanthropies that found most respondents in five surveyed countries – including Colombia, India, Jordan, the United Republic of Tanzania  and the United States of America rank an NCD or NCD risk factor as the biggest health problem in their country.
The public’s awareness of the links between NCDs and their risk factors such, as tobacco and alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, and lack of physical activity, is low. Yet, the majority of people surveyed across all countries support a wide number of proven interventions and policies that can reduce deaths from NCDs, such as incorporating more green spaces in urban health design and increasing taxes on tobacco.
“As we continue to respond to this pandemic and prepare for the next, we have seen the critical importance of addressing a major risk factor in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths – noncommunicable diseases,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, Founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries. “Noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and cancer are the world’s biggest silent killers – but they can often be prevented with investment in proven, cost-effective interventions. I look forward to continuing to make life-saving investments in NCD and injury prevention alongside Dr Tedros and the WHO.”
As WHO Global Ambassador, Bloomberg will continue to support global, national, and local efforts to protect people from NCDs and injuries. This work also advances the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3.4) target to reduce the global number of NCD deaths by one-third through high-impact, population-level policies and programmes implemented in cities across the world.
NCDs cause nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide. Every year, 17 million people under the age of 70 die of NCDs, 86 percent of whom live in low- and middle-income countries. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the NCD burden by delaying and disrupting care, and in the early months of the pandemic, 75 percent of countries reported disruption to essential NCD services because of lockdown restrictions and channelling of resources. While every Member State of the United Nations has committed to reducing premature death from NCDs by one-third by 2030 – an effort that could save millions of lives – few countries are currently on track to achieve it. Urgent global efforts are needed to get back on track to reach Sustainable Development Goal targets and reduce premature deaths from NCDs.

Title: African leaders launch the Education Plus initiative – a huge step forward for girls’ education and empowerment in Africa
Content: 22 July 2022
LUSAKA, ZAMBIA / GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, 18 July 2022
Leaders meeting at the Africa Union summit in Lusaka, Zambia, have pledged their support for the Education Plus initiative at its continental launch, committing to take action to keep adolescent girls in school, which will dramatically reduce their vulnerability to HIV.
Every week, around 4200 adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa acquire HIV. In 2020, six in seven adolescents aged between 15—19 years old acquiring HIV in the region were girls. More than 23000 young women died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2020, making it the second leading cause of death among women aged 15—29 after maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.
Keeping girls in secondary school and providing them with life skills, training and employment opportunities is key to ending the AIDS pandemic in Africa. Research shows that ensuring that girls complete secondary education reduces their risk of acquiring HIV by up to half, and that combining this with a package of services and rights for girls’ empowerment reduces their risk further still.
Education Plus calls for free and quality secondary education for all girls and boys in sub-Saharan Africa by 2025; universal access to comprehensive sexuality education; fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and rights; freedom from gender-based and sexual violence; school-to-work transitions, and economic security and empowerment.
“My government has committed to the provision of free primary and secondary education for all,” said President Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia, who hosted the summit. “Education is the greatest equalizer and with appropriate education, everyone is given an opportunity to explore their full potential and be able to participate in the development process. Access to education empowers both girls and boys as it enhances their ability to access decent jobs and other means of production thus alleviating poverty.”
The President of Senegal and current chair of the African Union, Macky Sall, launched the initiative flanked by three other presidents and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat.
“It is my pleasure to join you on the occasion of the ceremony to launch the continental “Education Plus Initiative” under the leadership of the Organisation of African First Ladies (OAFLAD) in support to children and young girls in particular,” said President Sall. “There is need for action to promote women’s rights and autonomy, to fight against the discrimination and violence which girls and women face. We must address gender inequality at all stages of life. At the continental level, AU Member States are committed to accelerating the implementation of gender-specific economic, social, and legal measures aimed at combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic by adopting various policy and legal frameworks including the Maputo Protocol.”
The launch was held in partnership with the Organisation of African First Ladies for Development, convened by the First Lady of Zambia, Mutinta Hichilema.
“I am confident that Education Plus will enable us all to protect, provide and preserve the lives of adolescent girls and young women by enhancing education standards and preventing new HIV infections by use of various interventions,” said Ms Hichilema.
“We lend our voice to the transformative call for gender-inclusive education in Africa,” said Leyla Gozo, Executive Secretary of the Organisation of African First Ladies for Development, “First ladies are uniquely positioned to amplify this initiative.”
The Education Plus initiative has taken on even greater urgency as the COVID-19 pandemic pushed millions of girls out of school. Even before the pandemic, almost 34 million adolescent girls aged 12—17 years old in the sub-Saharan Africa region were not in secondary school. Evidence also shows that girls are less likely to restart school once they have dropped out.
Ten African countries – Benin, Cameroon, Eswatini, Gabon, Gambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Uganda – have so far committed to the initiative which is jointly convened by five United Nations agencies, UNAIDS, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNICEF and UN Women, and brings together governments, civil society and international partners.
“We are making progress in Africa but not fast enough,” said UNAIDS Executive Director, Winnie Byanyima in her address to the launch. “We need to urgently address the gender inequalities that still plague the continent, with devastating impacts on poor girls and young women. We don’t have a minute to wait.  Working together, we can all end discriminatory laws and harmful social norms, so that our girls are healthy, educated and empowered and can lead our continent, Africa, forward.”

Title: Actions to Transform Education in Zambia Identified by Education Sector Stakeholders
Content: 19 July 2022
Lusaka, 19 July 2022 – Zambia’s Minister of Education, Douglas Syakalima, MP, today opened the Transforming Education Summit National Consultation Meeting in Lusaka. The objective of the consultation is to discuss the current education landscape in Zambia and to identify actions needed to transform the country’s educational outcomes. This consultation is the pre-cursor to the Transforming Education Summit which the UN Secretary General will convene during the United Nations General Assembly in September this year, in which the Government of the Republic of Zambia will participate.
“We need to take urgent action to change course and realizing this vision of education is not an impossible task. There is hope, especially among the younger generations. However, we will need the entire country’s creativity and intelligence to ensure that inclusion, equity, human rights and cultural diversity tolerance define our future,” Minister Syakalima said.
Globally, across low-middle- and high-income countries, 70 per cent of 10-year-olds are now estimated to be unable to read and understand a simple text. This equates to around 471 million primary school-aged children. According to the Examinations Council of Zambia 2016 National Assessment Survey, 70.25 per cent of Grade 5 Zambian learners were found to be ‘Below the Minimum Level of Proficiency in English while 62.31% were found to be ‘Below Minimum Level of Proficiency in Math’.
The impact of COVID-19 and its resultant school closures has further exacerbated the pre-existing learning crisis and access to continuous education. Following the re-opening of schools, the 2020-2021 Catch-up Programme (Ministry of Education) Assessment found that 57% of Grade 3 to 5 learners in five provinces were not able to identify words in local languages while 37% of Grade 3 to 5 learners were not able to do addition or subtraction. This presents a tremendous challenge for future learning, as basic literacy and numeracy skills are foundational to and essential for, the success of all other educational objectives.
“The Government of the Republic of Zambia has already demonstrated its commitment by eliminating fees for learners, increasing the number of teachers in schools, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school. We believe Zambia is well positioned to take advantage of the Transforming Education Summit – to showcase its progressive reform agenda, and to join the global community to renew its financial commitment to the education sector. The future of Zambia’s children rests in the commitments and actions that we take today,” said UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Beatrice Mutali.
The National Consultation bring together stakeholders from Government, civil society organisations, religious leaders, teachers, students and international development partners. The findings of the consultation will be integrated into a report which will be submitted by Zambia to the UN Summit for Transforming Education, where Heads of State and Governments will announce their national commitments to transforming education.
The Transforming Education Summit, convened by the UN Secretary-General in New York this September, comes after more than two years of the most massive disruption in learning in recorded history, brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Summit seeks to mobilize political ambition, action, solutions and solidarity to transform education: to take stock of efforts to recover pandemic-related learning losses; reimagine education systems for the world of today and tomorrow and revitalize national and global efforts to achieve SDG-4.

Title: Stakeholders Meet to Validate the UN Zambia Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2027
Content: 11 June 2022
Lusaka, 11 June 2022:
On 9 June 2022, representatives from Zambian Government ministries and other stakeholders that included Civil Society, quasi-government institutions, academia, private sector, people living with disabilities and youth organisations convened in Lusaka under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning and the United Nations in Zambia to validate the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for support to Zambia for the period 2023-2027. In total, about200 people participated in this hybrid event.
The UNSDCF or Cooperation Framework is a UN programming document that will guide support by the UN in Zambia over the next five years in line with Zambia’s development priorities as contained in the 8th National Development Plan. It is a product of a highly inclusive, consultative process with a wide range of stakeholders under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning. The process included engagements on the Common Country Analysis (CCA), which is an impartial, collective and independent analysis that helped the UN to determine its priorities for the next programming cycle.
Speaking at the validation workshop, Ministry of Finance and National Planning Permanent Secretary for Monitoring and Evaluation, Mr. Trevor Kaunda underscored the importance of the Cooperation Framework in helping Zambia meets its development priorities.
And speaking on behalf of the UN system in Zambia, Mr. Lionel Laurens, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative, called for partnerships in implementation of the Cooperation Framework.
“Implementation of the Cooperation Framework during the next five years is key in contributing to the desired positive impact and transformational changes. There is a need for strong collaboration, reinvigorated partnerships and joint efforts for fruitful synergies from all key stakeholders if the Cooperation Framework is to achieve its intended objectives,” said Mr. Laurens.
A similar consultative meeting was on 7 June held with Cooperating Partners who shared their perspectives and expectations on UN support from 2023-2027. Input from participants will be used to finalise the Cooperation Framework and thus ensure that it addresses major national priorities and contribute significantly towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Agenda 2030. The Cooperation Framework is expected to be launched shortly.

Title: UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima to visit Zambia
Content: 05 June 2022
LUSAKA, 5 June 2022
The Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and Under-Secretary General of the United Nations Winnie Byanyima, will visit Zambia from 7–10 June 2022 for high-level meetings with Government, Cooperating Partners, Civil Society, and grassroots organisations in support of Zambia’s continued efforts to curb HIV infections and ensure access to treatment to all who need it across the country.
This visit is an important moment. Zambia has a significant HIV epidemic with more than 1.5 million people living with HIV in the country, 1.17 million of whom were on life-saving antiretroviral treatment as at the end 2020. Zambia has reaffirmed its global commitments to end inequalities and end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.
“This visit could not have come at a better time as the United Nations in Zambia is getting ready to launch its new Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for support from 2023 to 2027, that is aligned to the Government’s 8th National Development Plan. We are more determined than ever to support and leave no one behind,” said UNAIDS Zambia Country Director, Dr Tharcisse Barihuta.
Discussions around youth empowerment, addressing inequalities, and removing barriers to accessing services, and related topics will remain among the top priorities for Ms Byanyima to address, who is a strong advocate for community-led responses that centre around community participation and human rights.
“We know how to end AIDS, but it’s the social issues, propelled by stigma, discrimination, inequalities and unequal access to health and social services, treatment and support which are holding us back – we have to break these barriers to reach everyone in need,” Dr Barihuta added.
Zambia has made important progress and reached significant milestones, including strong progress towards the goal of the 90-90-90 targets. However, the numbers of new infections remain high despite the consistent reduction among general population and among young women.

Title: Zambia’s pledge to abolish the death penalty
Content: 27 May 2022
FROM
UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Seif Magango
We warmly welcome the Zambian President’s pledge on 24 May to abolish the death penalty in the country and work with Parliament to end this cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. Use of the death penalty is incompatible with fundamental human rights and dignity.
While Zambia has maintained a welcome moratorium on the death penalty since 1997 when executions last took place, its formal abolition in law would be a major step forward for human rights in the country, adding to the growing consensus worldwide for universal abolition of the death penalty. Some 170 States have abolished or introduced a moratorium on the death penalty either in law or in practice.
We urge the Zambian Government and Parliament to promptly bolster the President’s pledge with tangible legal reforms, including amending the Penal Code Act and the Criminal Procedure Code Act to remove capital provisions there, as well as re-launching the Constitutional Reform process to expand the Bill of Rights, including with explicit prohibition of the death penalty. We also encourage the Government to demonstrate further international leadership on this key issue by ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on abolition of the death penalty.
The UN Human Rights Office stands ready to provide technical assistance and cooperation to the Zambian authorities to make this promise a reality.

Title: United Nations Develops Five Year Plan to Support Zambia
Content: 10 April 2022
Lusaka, 10 April 2022: The United Nations (UN) in Zambia is in the final stages of developing the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) which will guide its partnership with Government of the Republic of Zambia from 2023-2027.
The Cooperation Framework will guide UN agencies in the country in aligning their programmes with Government priorities.
The process of developing the Cooperation Framework has been undertaken through consultations with various stakeholders including Government ministries. In addition, the Cooperation Framework has benefitted from the analysis in the UN Common Country Analysis (CCA) and the final evaluation of the current UN Sustainable Development Partnership Framework 2016-2022. The UNSDCF aims to support the Government achieve transformative change through its development outcomes and expected results in four pillars relating to People, Peace, Prosperity and Planet.
“The Cooperation Framework integrates core UN programming principles that include Leaving No One Behind, A Human Rights-Based Approach, Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment, Resilience, Sustainability, and Accountability. It is anchored in Zambia’s development priorities and aligned to the pillars of the Eight National Development Plan,” said outgoing UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio.
“As the UN, we remain committed to supporting Zambia’s development trajectory and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” she added.
Going forward, the UN will hold a validation workshop with the Ministry of Finance and National Planning as well as other stakeholders before the UNSDCF is disseminated.

Title: Zambia to participate in United Nations Food Systems Summit
Content: 20 September 2021
Lusaka, 19 September 2021

On 23 September 2021, His Excellency Mr. Hakainde Hichilema, President of the Republic of Zambia will join other Heads of State and Government at the Food Systems Summit convened by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres during the 76th UN General Assembly in New York, United States of America.
“Climate shocks, limited crop and food diversity, high pests and disease burden and post-harvest food losses in addition to low intake of nutritious foods; all contribute towards Zambia’s food system challenges which must be addressed in order end hunger as the springboard for achieving all the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The Summit is a platform for Zambia and other nations to recommit to the 2030 sustainable Development Goals only this time to also state actionable commitments that ensure everyone Zambian has access to affordable and nutritious foods for a healthy and productive people,” said Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Zambia.
The Summit was conceived in 2019 by the UN Secretary-General as a “bottom-up” process to discuss and explore ways to achieve sustainable food systems by 2030. The solutions would come from dialogues between actors at all levels of the food system – the world’s 500 million small farmers, refugees, governments, NGOs, corporations, universities and think-tanks. The Summit is intended to catalyse momentum to transform the way the world produces, consumes and thinks about food. The Food Systems Summit is open to all people and its success depends on the engagement of citizens all over the world.
Under the leadership of the National Dialogue Convener, Zambia has conducted several district, provincial and national dialogues to solicit inputs from various stakeholders in developing a blueprint outlining the country’s commitments and transformative food systems pathways, actionable by the Zambian Government.
The preparation for Zambia’s participation at the Summit is being supported by the United Nations, cooperating partners, experts in line ministries, academia, and civil society under the National Food and Nutrition Commission as Secretariat.

Title: United Nations Congratulates Zambia on Election of First Female Speaker
Content: 04 September 2021
Lusaka, 04 September 2021
The United Nations (UN) in Zambia congratulates Zambia and all Members of Parliament in particular, on the election of Lusaka Lawyer Nelly Mutti as the country’s first female Speaker of the National Assembly.
“Mrs. Mutti’s election as Zambia’s first female speaker demonstrates commitment to advance gender equality, particularly by increasing the number of women in key decision-making positions and female empowerment as a whole,” said UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio.
“Zambia needs to work at ending the underrepresentation of women. The country needs to make progress on national, regional, and global commitments including the African Union Agenda 2063 which calls for ensuring the effective participation of women in decision-making as well as the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development which advocates for 50/50 gender representation in decision-making positions,” added Dr. Gadio.
With 2021 marking the 26th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, which advocates for the inclusion of women in decision-making, it is hoped that Zambia will continue taking practical steps to ensure that more women meaningfully participate in politics and other sectors of society, especially as leaders.

The United Nations (UN) in Zambia strongly condemns the killing of two individuals in Solwezi, North Western province as Zambians cast their votes. The UN also condemns other acts of violence that left some individuals injured and property destroyed in other parts of the country.
“I extend deep condolences to the bereaved families and wish a speedy recovery to all who were injured. I wish to remind all political players and the public that violence is not a legitimate or desirable means of engagement in the political sphere. It is the contest over issues and the exercise of one’s civil duty and expression of choice through the ballot that counts,” said UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio.
“We urge everyone to remain peaceful while awaiting the results to be declared after which all Zambians, regardless of political persuasions, should unite and build their country together,” added Dr. Gadio.
The United Nations will continue to support the Government and the people of Zambia in preserving Zambia’s stability and its democratic path.

Title: United Nations Condemns Political Violence in Zambia
Content: 02 August 2021
Lusaka, 2 August 2021
The United Nations (UN) in Zambia strongly condemns the recent killing of two political party supporters in Kanyama, Lusaka, as well as other incidents of political violence reported in the country in the run-up to general elections due on 12 August. The ongoing violence can pose a threat to the conduct of credible and peaceful elections and undermine core democratic values enshrined in the Constitution of Zambia.
“There is no justification to indulge in violence, kill or harm another person or destroy property to settle political differences in a multiparty democracy. Let us not forget that a democracy is a system of Government providing a framework for organized and continuous dialogue to resolve differences”, said UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio.
“The UN calls on all Zambian political leaders to publicly condemn any form of violence and instruct their supporters to abide by the electoral code of conduct and refrain from any violent acts and to pursue constructive dialogue and existing legal mechanisms to settle their differences, peacefully and amicably,” added Dr. Gadio.
The UN will continue monitoring the situation and engaging with the Government and people of Zambia to maintain and sustain peace which is essential for attaining the country’s development priorities.

Title: New MIT Study says United Nations Pause Campaign Slows Spread of Life-Threatening Misinformation
Content: 01 July 2021
1 July 2021, New York
Through the course of a tumultuous year globally, the United Nations Verified initiative has worked to cut through the noise on social media -- teaming up with the finest minds in medical science and behavioural research to identify factors prolonging the pandemic.
A major part of that work is the UN’s Pause campaign, which encourages people to pause to check the validity of any information they share. Now, a new study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) says the Pause campaign can bring about the behavioural change needed to stop the spread of misinformation.
The MIT study, conducted in the UK and the US, found that the simple act of pausing to question the origin, credibility, relevance and accuracy of any information before sharing it on phones, computers and social media platforms, significantly reduced people’s propensity to share misinformation. In the study, participants who saw Pause campaign content were notably less likely to share fake headlines.
“The monumental task of tackling misinformation belongs to all of us. It is about how we can come together to drive social change, shifting behavioural norms and tapping into people’s sense of solidarity to keep each other safe,” said Melissa Fleming, the UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications.
“The MIT study shows that pausing before sharing is not only possible but also the responsible thing to do, especially in an age where it has become hard to separate the truth from the lies.”
The Pause campaign, created in collaboration with Purpose, a social impact agency, is part of the wider Verified initiative launched by UN Secretary-General António Guterres in May 2020 to deliver trusted COVID-19-related medical and science information and advice, and stop the spread of misinformation. According to the World Health Organization, in the first three months of 2020 alone, nearly 6,000 people were hospitalized because of COVID-19 misinformation.
The Pause campaign, which reached nearly 1 billion people in 2020, is redoubling its efforts to empower more people to share information responsibly. The new phase of the campaign asks the world to take the #PledgetoPause and flood the Internet with the pause symbol.
Guided by research, the campaign is built on the premise that by interrupting, even for a few seconds, the impulse to share something we see -- an urge often fuelled by emotions such as excitement, anger, sadness, elation, and even altruism -- we allow ourselves time to think more critically. Better judgement prevails and fewer bogus claims are circulated.
In the words of the UN Secretary-General: “During the COVID-19 pandemic, the wrong information can be deadly. Take the pledge to pause and help stop the spread of misinformation.”
ABOUT VERIFIED
Verified is a United Nations initiative, in collaboration with Purpose, that aims to empower people around the world with science-based information during the Covid-19 response. Working with UN agencies, influencers, civil society, businesses, and social media platforms, Verified creates and distributes trusted, accurate information and encourages consumers to change their media consumption practices to reduce and stop the spread of misinformation online. Website: https://shareverified.com/en/

ABOUT PAUSE CAMPAIGN
Launched as a part of the UN Verified initiative, the Pause Campaign draws on research from psychologists, neuroscientists and behavioural scientists whose studies indicate that pausing to reflect before sharing can significantly help to reduce the spread of unverified and misleading information. The overall campaign, which was launched a year ago, challenges people to break the habit of sharing shocking or emotive content impulsively and without questioning its accuracy.

Title: UNODC World Drug Report 2021: pandemic effects ramp up drug risks, as youth underestimate cannabis dangers
Content: 24 June 2021
VIENNA, 24 June 2021
Around 275 million people used drugs worldwide in the last year, while over 36 million people suffered from drug use disorders, according to the 2021 World Drug Report, released today by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
The Report further noted that in the last 24 years cannabis potency had increased by as much as four times in parts of the world, even as the percentage of adolescents who perceived the drug as harmful fell by as much as 40 per cent, despite evidence that cannabis use is associated with a variety of health and other harms, especially among regular long-term users.
"Lower perception of drug use risks has been linked to higher rates of drug use, and the findings of UNODC’s 2021 World Drug Report highlight the need to close the gap between perception and reality to educate young people and safeguard public health,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly.
“The theme of this year’s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is “Share facts on drugs. Save lives”, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the evidence base and raising public awareness, so that the international community, governments, civil society, families and youth can make informed decisions, better target efforts to prevent and treat drug use, and tackle world drug challenges.”
According to the Report, the percentage of Δ9-THC —the main psychoactive component in cannabis— has risen from around six per cent to more than 11 per cent in Europe between 2002-2019, and around four per cent to 16 per cent in the United States between 1995-2019, while the percentage of adolescents that perceived cannabis as harmful declined by 40 per cent in the United States and by 25 per cent in Europe.
Moreover, most countries have reported a rise in the use of cannabis during the pandemic. In surveys of health professionals across 77 countries, 42 per cent asserted that cannabis use had increased. A rise in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs has also been observed in the same period.
Drug Use Rising, but Science-Based Treatment More Available
Between 2010-2019 the number of people using drugs increased by 22 per cent, owing in part to global population growth. Based on demographic changes alone, current projections suggest an 11 per cent rise in the number of people who use drugs globally by 2030 -- and a marked increase of 40 per cent in Africa, due to its rapidly growing and young population.
According to the latest global estimates, about 5.5 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 64 years have used drugs at least once in the past year, while 36.3 million people, or 13 per cent of the total number of persons who use drugs, suffer from drug use disorders.
Globally, over 11 million people are estimated to inject drugs, half of whom are living with Hepatitis C. Opioids continue to account for the largest burden of disease attributed to drug use.
The two pharmaceutical opioids most commonly used to treat people with opioid use disorders, methadone and buprenorphine, have become increasingly accessible over the past two decades. The amount available for medical use has increased six-fold since 1999, from 557 million daily doses to 3,317 million by 2019, indicating that science-based pharmacological treatment is more available now than in the past.
The Dark Web
Drug markets on the dark web only emerged a decade ago but major ones are now worth at least US$ 315 million in annual sales. Although this is just a fraction of overall drug sales, the trend is upwards with a fourfold increase between 2011 to mid-2017 and mid-2017 to 2020.
Rapid technological innovation, combined with the agility and adaptability of those using new platforms to sell drugs and other substances, is likely to usher in a globalized market where all drugs are more available and accessible everywhere. This, in turn, could trigger accelerated changes in patterns of drug use and entail public health implications, according to the Report.
The Drug Market Rebounds and Shifts
The new report shows that drug markets have swiftly resumed operations after the initial disruption at the onset of the pandemic; a burst that has triggered or accelerated certain pre-existing trafficking dynamics across the global drug market. Among these are: increasingly larger shipments of illicit drugs, a rise in the frequency of overland and water-way routes used for trafficking, greater use of private planes for the purpose of drug trafficking, and an upsurge in the use of contactless methods to deliver drugs to end-consumers.
The resilience of drug markets during the pandemic has demonstrated once again traffickers’ ability to adapt quickly to changed environments and circumstances.
The Report also noted that cocaine supply chains to Europe are diversifying, pushing prices down and quality up and thereby threatening Europe with a further expansion of the cocaine market. This is likely to widen the potential harm caused by the drug in the region.
The number of new psychoactive substances (NPS) emerging on the global market fell from 163 in 2013 to 71 in 2019. This reflects trends in North America, Europe and Asia. The findings suggest national and international control systems have succeeded in limiting the spread of NPS in high income countries, where NPS first emerged a decade ago.
Drug Risks, New Developments Spurred by Pandemic
COVID-19 has triggered innovation and adaptation in drug prevention and treatment services through more flexible models of service delivery. Many countries have introduced or expanded telemedicine services due to the pandemic, which for drug users means that healthcare workers can now offer counselling or initial assessments over the telephone and use electronic systems to prescribe controlled substances.
While the impact of COVID-19 on drug challenges is not yet fully known, the analysis suggests that the pandemic has brought increasing economic hardship that is likely to make illicit drug cultivation more appealing to fragile rural communities. The social impact of the pandemic –driving a rise in inequality, poverty, and mental health conditions particularly among already vulnerable populations-- represent factors that could push more people into drug use.

The United Nations in Zambia has received with deep regret and sadness news of the death of Zambia’s First Republican President who was the last surviving founder of the Organisation of African Unity, His Excellency Dr Kenneth Kaunda.
“We join the immediate family and the Government and people of Zambia in mourning the passing of a great statesman and son of Africa. The United Nations notes Dr Kaunda’s contributions to the liberation struggle in Africa that led to political independence in many countries, and his generous support to thousands of refugees escaping conflict in their own land,” said UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr Coumba Mar Gadio.
“Dr Kaunda was a significant figure in the history of this continent. Among his many legacies, we remember and celebrate his decades-long support to the fight against the HIV and AIDS pandemic at a time when few were willing to speak out publicly. His unwavering and high-level leadership helped break down taboos and stigma, and undoubtedly saved many lives,” added Dr Gadio.
Dr Kaunda served as an ambassador for the Brothers for Life campaign to encourage more men to be tested for HIV, and in 2018 was presented with a UNAIDS Leadership Award for his remarkable contribution.

UN Headquarters will observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Thursday, 27 May 2021.
Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour the more than 4,000 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and will preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 129 military, police and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their life serving under the UN flag last year and in the first month of this year.
Among the fallen peacekeepers to be honoured are two from Zambia:  WO1 Godfrey Philimon Mwape who served with the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA; and Ms. Norma Sialumba Mwambazi who served in a civilian capacity with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).
Zambia is the 20th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to the UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys nearly 1,000 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Mali, and South Sudan.
At the ceremony, the Secretary-General will also award the ‘2020 Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award’ to Major Steplyne Nyaboga a Kenyan military officer who served with the African Union – United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, (UNAMID). Created in 2016, the Award “recognises the dedication and effort of an individual peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.”
In a message to mark the Day, the Secretary-General said of the fallen peacekeepers: “Their service and sacrifices will never be forgotten.”  He further said: “I express my deep gratitude to the 85,000 civilian, police and military personnel currently deployed in some of the world’s most challenging hotspots to protect the vulnerable and help to build peace. Despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, as well as the risk of infection, these men and women have pursued their mission while also supporting local authorities in the fight against COVID-19. I offer sincere condolences to the families of peacekeepers who have fallen victim to this terrible disease.”
The theme for this year’s observance is “The road to a lasting peace: Leveraging the power of youth for peace and security.” Tens of thousands of young peacekeepers deployed around the world play a key role in helping UN missions implement their mandated activities, with the active participation of young people from host communities.  Across our missions, peacekeepers collaborate with youth to reduce violence and sustain peace, including through DDR and Community violence reduction programmes. 

Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “We salute the dedication and bravery of our peacekeepers, who serve and perform admirably in challenging environments only compounded by the ongoing pandemic. I also honor our young peacekeepers who bring energy and innovation, and serve as role models to youth populations working tirelessly to ensure meaningful representation and participation in political processes.”
He added: “Our peacekeepers deserve our full support, and we must continue to work together to do all we can to improve their safety and security and give them the tools to succeed.”

The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine.

Since then, more than 1 million women and men have served in 72 UN peacekeeping operations, directly impacting millions of people, and saving countless lives. Today, UN Peacekeeping deploys more than 89,000 military, police and civilian personnel in 12 operations.

Title: Government and United Nations to Host High Level Dialogue on Increasing Women’s Participation in Electoral Processes
Content: 16 April 2021
Virtual dialogue meeting to also address violence against women in elections
LUSAKA, 16th April 2021: The Government of the Republic of Zambia, through the Office of the Vice-President, in partnership with the United Nations in Zambia, will on 21st April 2021 hold a virtual High-Level Dialogue aimed at increasing women’s participation in electoral processes and addressing violence against women during elections. The Dialogue, organised in the lead up to Zambia’s general elections on 12th August 2021, will also tackle other reasons for Zambian women’s underrepresentation in the electoral processes, decision making structures and the broad socio-economic development agenda of the country.
The High-Level Dialogue, is guided by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women Peace and Security which advocates for the inclusion of women in decision making and peace processes. The Dialogue will also reaffirm commitments made at the 65th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW65) held in March 2021, during which world leaders agreed that promoting increased women’s representation in government decision-making bodies is essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Arising from this effort, women leaders across the world continue to mobilise the global development agenda and inspiring a better future for all.
The event will draw participation from the Zambian Government, the United Nations, parliamentarians, non-state actors including political parties, women leaders from other countries, academia and members of the diplomatic community. The Dialogue will further demonstrate that in Zambia, like many countries globally, women’s participation in governance continues to be limited, yet it remains a top priority and a critical element for achieving gender equality.
Evidence from across the globe has shown that only when women and men have full access to decision-making positions will laws, policies, and budgets reflect the needs of all citizens and support women’s rights and inclusive development as well as sustainable peace and empowerment in homes, communities and nations at large.
In order to underscore the importance of the Dialogue, it is important to note that following the 2016 general elections, Zambia achieved 19 % women representation in Parliament, 6 % more than the previous elections. Although this was a remarkable improvement, the outcome still falls short of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Gender and Development that calls for at least 50% female representation in decision making positions; and  the regional average of 24% in 2019, as well as the global goals set in the Beijing Platform for Action, especially the provisions on women’s equal access to and full participation in power structures and decision making; the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063 which calls on the AU member states to ensure the effective participation of women in decision-making.
Many societies and institutions still believe that men make natural and better leaders than women, and funding for women’s campaigns and initiatives remain pitifully low. Evidence shows that at the current rate of progress, it will take 130 years to reach gender equality in the highest positions of power. Thus, the High-Level Dialogue will discuss key issues that hinder women’s political participation, violence against women in the political arena and increased number of women in politics. It is expected that a resounding movement of women from all walks of life will be ignited and both men and women will be mobilized for social change towards a more equal political landscape where there is zero tolerance towards violence.

Title: UN Zambia Calls for Respect of Human Rights
Content: 15 April 2021
Such acts are unacceptable and are against Zambia’s Constitution through which the people of Zambia have committed “to upholding the principles of democracy and good governance”.
“We reaffirm the need to observe the rule of law and fully respect the human rights of all Zambians, regardless of their political persuasion or affiliation,” said UN Zambia Resident Coordinator Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio.
The United Nations in Zambia calls on politicians, party members and their supporters across the political spectrum to unite and stand for peace, and for the State to protect the political rights of all citizens. Such action, led by the State, is necessary and consistent with Zambia’s international human rights obligations including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which reminds us that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
The United Nations in Zambia welcomes the Government’s condemnation of this incident and the arrest of the alleged perpetrators.  All acts of violence must be subject to prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigations, and the individuals found responsible must be brought to justice.

Title: UN launches new campaign, Only Together, to support global vaccine equity call
Content: 11 March 2021
Campaign to promote COVID-19 vaccine equity around the world.
11 March, New York -- The United Nations today launched a new global campaign, Only Together to support its call for fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
The campaign stresses the need for coordinated global action to ensure vaccines are accessible in all countries, starting with health-care workers and the most vulnerable.
"Over the past year, we’ve all missed out on doing the things we love to do with others—eating, hugging, and going to school and work,” said UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed.
“Millions of us have lost someone we love or had our livelihoods taken away. An unprecedented global scientific effort for vaccines has given us hope to defeat the virus — but only if we work together to ensure everyone, everywhere has access to COVID-19 vaccines. Only together can we end the pandemic and transform a new era of hope.”
More than 2.5 million people around the world have died from COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 vaccines will stop people from dying, prevent new variants from emerging, reignite economies and offer the best hope to end the pandemic.
The biggest vaccine roll out in history is now underway with millions of doses being delivered around the world, including to some of the world’s poorest countries, through the efforts of COVAX, the global vaccine equity mechanism.
But these doses will initially only cover a small segment of the populations — healthcare workers and the most vulnerable. By the end of 2021, COVAX aims to offer vaccines to nearly 30 per cent of each participating country’s population. But that progress pales compared to ten rich countries who possess nearly 80 per cent of all COVID-19 vaccines, with some planning to vaccinate their entire population within the next few months.
COVAX, which is led by the World Health Organization, GAVI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and in partnership with UNICEF, has 190 participating countries. It needs more than US$2 billion to fully meet its goal to vaccinate those most in need by the end of the year.
Pledging new funding for COVAX is critical, but more can be done to scale up vaccine access by sharing excess vaccines, transferring technology, offering voluntary licensing or even waiving intellectual property rights.
“If the world’s scientists were able to develop safe and effective vaccines in just seven months, the aims of world’s leaders must be equally record-breaking — to provide enough funding and to ramp up manufacturing to enable everyone on earth to be vaccinated,” said UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming.

Title: Zambia Launches 2020 Human Development Report
Content: 05 March 2021
Lusaka, 5 March 2021 – The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest crisis facing the world, but unless humans release their grip on nature, it won’t be the last, according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which includes a new experimental index on human progress that takes into account countries’ carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint.
The Report, which was virtually launched in Zambia today, lays out a stark choice for countries to take urgent and bold steps to reduce the immense pressure that is being exerted on the environment and the natural world, or humanity’s progress will stall. The report argues that we are in an unprecedented moment in the history of our planet, that scientists term “Anthropocene,” a new geological epoch: the age of humans. For the first time in our long 300,000-year relationship, instead of the planet shaping humans, human activity is shaping the planet.
“This report calls for a renewed commitment to and investment in multilateralism, with better monitoring and enforcement so that the actions of a few countries do not limit the choices of all. The Anthropocene forces us to recognise that it is not enough to look at planetary imbalances in silos. We need to see challenges as interdependent and make systemic changes collectively” says Trevor Kaunda, the Permanent Secretary for Development Cooperation, Monitoring and Evaluation in Zambia’s Ministry of National Development Planning.
The report shows that across the globe, human development has largely happened with huge pressure on the planet showing that no country in the world has achieved yet the magic combination of high Human Development and low planetary pressure. The report argues that humans are destabilizing the very systems they need to survive and resulting pressures on our planetary systems are manifested not just as climate change and biodiversity loss but in many other ways including pollution, ocean acidification, land degradation that are affecting disproportionality developing countries. Inequalities between and within countries not only reflect unequal consequences of a dangerous planetary change, gross imbalances of power and opportunities are also the major obstacle in the way of finding solutions. For example, the poorest countries in the world could experience up to 100 more days of extreme weather a year by 2100, whereas rich countries could have this number reduced to 18 days a year, despite being more responsible for climate change.
It is time for all countries to redesign their development paths to progress by fully accounting for the dangerous pressures humans put on the planet and dismantle the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that prevent change. To illustrate the point, the 30th anniversary edition of the Human Development Report, The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene, introduces an experimental new lens to its annual Human Development Index (HDI).
By adjusting the HDI, which measures a nation’s health, education, and standards of living, to include two more elements: a country’s carbon dioxide emissions and its material footprint, the index shows how the global development landscape would change if both the wellbeing of people and also the planet were central to defining humanity’s progress. With the resulting Planetary-Pressures Adjusted HDI – or PHDI - a new global picture emerges, painting a less rosy but clearer assessment of human progress.
The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming people’s values and social norms, scaling up nature-based solutions, creating the right incentives for change and enforcing tailor-made regulations that influence our decision making to promote rather than prevent planetary damage, the report argues.
The report further suggest that to steer actions towards transformational change, it is important to empower people in three ways, by enhancing equity, by pursuing innovation and by instilling a sense of stewardship of nature grounded on the responsible use and protection of the natural environment through conservation and sustainable practices to enhance ecosystem resilience and human wellbeing.
A range of nature-based solutions comprising reforestation and taking better care of forests could alone account for roughly a quarter of the pre-2030 actions we must take to stop global warming from reaching two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the report shows.
In Zambia, the virtual event was organized around speeches and a panel discussion where experts from the Government, the United Nations, the Development community, the academia, think tanks and civil society organisations enlightened the exchanges on the 2020 Human Development Report.
“As this report shows, Zambia’s human development index value for 2019 is 0.584. This puts the country in the medium human development category and at position 146 of the 189 countries and territories. Between 1990 and 2019, Zambia’s HDI value increased from 0.421 to 0.584, an increase of 38.7 percent,” Permanent Secretary Kaunda said, noting that while it is gratifying to note progress for the country, Zambia still needs to do more if it is to attain the set objectives outlined in the vision 2030. It is worth noting that Zambia’s life expectancy at birth increased by 14.6 years, mean years of schooling increased by 2.5 years and expected years of schooling increased by 4.0 years. Zambia’s GNI per capita increased by about 65.0 percent between 1990 and 2019. He said Government is committed to exploring new frontiers aimed at building a more resilient and sustainable Zambia.
“For the UN System in Zambia in particular, this report provides timely theoretical and empirical reference materials for the development of our Country Analysis and new Cooperation Framework that will form the basis of our support within our next programmatic cycle. This report's findings and recommendations provide ‘food for thought’, data and background information to inform the design of policies towards sustainable development,” the UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio said, reaffirming the United Nations’ commitment to working with the Government and partners on advancing sustainable development in the country.
“It is worth noting and commendable that Zambia has been using the HDI as a key indicator in its Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP),” said Lionel Laurens, UNDP Resident Representative in Zambia. “We must work together and go beyond discrete solutions to individual problems and instead focus on mechanisms that will transform our lifestyles, how we work, eat, interact and, most of all, how we consume energy. We must also recognize that we are part of nature and not separate from it and could learn from traditional societies that have maintained a strong sense of responsibility and agency because they recognize that our humanity is part of a larger network of connections with nature, with the planet and with all living things.” He added

Title: Next-generation Regional Collaborative Platform meeting kicks off for first time with regional UN entities in Africa
Content: 03 March 2021
Africa’s regional know-how, assets and policy expertise will be more systematically channeled to the Resident Coordinators and United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) across the continent as they help countries ensure an inclusive and sustainable transition out of the COVID-19 crisis, UN Deputy Secretary-General and Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group Amina J. Mohammed stressed as she joined the first annual meeting of the new Regional Collaborative Platform on 2 March 2021.
Press release
Next-generation Regional Collaborative Platform meeting kicks off for first time with regional UN entities in Africa
3 March 2021
BRAZZAVILLE – Africa’s regional know-how, assets and policy expertise will be more systematically channeled to the Resident Coordinators and United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) across the continent as they help countries ensure an inclusive and sustainable transition out of the COVID-19 crisis, UN Deputy Secretary-General and Chair of the UN Sustainable Development Group Amina J. Mohammed stressed as she joined the first annual meeting of the new Regional Collaborative Platform on 2 March 2021.
“Today marks the start of the next-generation collaboration approach for the regional UN entities to support African countries to respond and recover better from the COVID-19 pandemic and reignite the Decade of Action for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is aligned with the Africa Union Agenda 2063,” Ms. Mohammed said.
The United Nations has been making progress on its sweeping reforms to strengthen its support to countries, leveraging its capacities at all levels. The new Regional Collaborative Platform has responded to the growing need for enhanced UN coordination and regional collaboration in the face of the pandemic and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. It brings together UN regional expertise, capacity and data to provide analytical, policy and operational support to countries.
Yesterday’s discussion, attended by regional representatives from the Africa UN development system, focused on high-priority issues for the African continent to recover better from the pandemic and move toward the Sustainable Development Goals. These included accelerating the implementation of the continental free trade agreement; investing in youth and women’s empowerment to help countries reap the benefit of their demographic dividends; advancing home-grown sustainable and scalable technologies and digital solutions; building climate and disaster resilience; and continuing to support the African Union’s “Silencing the Guns” initiative.
Across the continent, Resident Coordinators and UNCTs are supporting countries in their access to COVAX vaccines and their socioeconomic response plans. In addition to the pandemic recovery, UN entities will work together to support sustainable development efforts in the Sahel, the Lake Chad Basin and the Horn of Africa, and address the resurgence of Ebola, and climate crises with severe damage caused by deadly droughts, cyclones and locust outbreaks.
“We are still in a recovery phase for the continent. We need additional resources. Our low- and middle-income countries, as well as small island states, have lost a lot of their resources. They need more fiscal space. They need more revenues. They need additional liquidity to ensure we build forward better,” said Under-Secretary-General Vera Songwe, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).
Although it was a transitional year, the regional UN entities demonstrated evidence of enhanced system-wide collaboration at the regional level. For example, last year, all of them joined forces to launch the Knowledge Management Hub on COVID-19 and shared a business continuity plan with governments to support their e-governance, e-justice and e-commerce for livelihoods, while the Africa e-education strategy was introduced to Resident Coordinators to provide emergency education to more than 100 million African children out of school.
“The African region is at a strategic juncture with COVID-19 recovery programmes and investments that we are making to enhance trade. All our efforts will yield desired results only if Africa’s people – our most important resource – feel productive, if they feel valued, if they feel safe, and if they feel secure,” said Assistant Secretary-General Ahunna Eziakonwa, Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa at the UN Development Programme (UNDP).
The new platform will engage with the African Union in April and accelerate its effort to deliver on its promise with an impact-oriented focus on implementations.
The Regional Collaborative Platform is chaired by the UN Deputy Secretary-General with two Vice-Chairs: Ms. Songwe and Ms. Eziakonwa. Its joint secretariat is comprised of UNECA, UNDP and the UN Development Coordination Office (DCO).

Title: UNDP Zambia and Partners Launch Safe Markets Project Ensuring business continuity in markets with compliance to COVID-19 measures
Content: 18 February 2021
Lusaka, Zambia, 17 February 2021: The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Lusaka City Council (LCC) and the Ministry of Health (MoH) today launched the pilot phase of the Safe Markets, Safe Communities project, an initiative towards ensuring that community markets are compliant to COVID-19 public health regulations. The initiative is co-funded by UNDP and the Governments of Sweden and Ireland.
“The project will strengthen knowledge and individual collective responsibilities toward adhering to public health regulations and prevent the spread of the deadly virus in our markets,” says Lusaka Deputy Mayor, Christopher Shakafuswa.
“As Lusaka City Council, we would like to thank the United Nations Development Programme for supplementing government’s efforts towards the fight against COVID-19 in markets and look forward to a successful partnership in executing identified activities efficiently,” the Lusaka Deputy Mayor said.
The event which was restricted to only 14 guests, in compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures, had in attendance the Lusaka Deputy Mayor, Christopher Shakafuswa, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative, Roland Seri, the Ministry of Health’s Director of Public Health, Dr. Andrew Silumesi, the LCC’s Director of Public Health, Edgar Mulwanda and the LCC’s Director of Housing and Social Services, Danny Chibinda along with three representatives from Nyumba Yanga, Chilenje and Lilanda Markets that were selected for the pilot phase.
Handing over an assortment of equipment, cleaning and awareness creation materials to the Lusaka City Council, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Roland Seri emphasized the need to help protect the livelihoods of women and youth who work in markets by enabling them continue their activities while adhering to COVID-19 measures.
“Markets have not only served as sources of affordable food to most households in the country but help to provide a means of income generation for the many women and youth that have set up livelihood ventures in these places. It is the protection of this means of income that makes this intervention robust as it is aimed at ensuring business continuity in potentially high COVID-19 risk places,’’ Seri said.
Speaking through a video message, the Swedish Ambassador to Zambia, Her Excellency, Ms. Anna Maj Hultgård said that the project would ensure gender equality and the empowerment of women by implementing affirmative action for sustaining women’s economic activities in the selected markets.
“The launch of the safe markets project is an example of efforts to reduce vulnerability to Gender-Based Violence by addressing the economic disempowerment of women resulting from restrictions around COVID-19. The safe markets will enable women, which are the majority of traders in the market, to continue trading in a way that minimizes or at least limits the risk of COVID-19”, said Ambassador Hultgård.
UNDP is supporting the Safe Markets initiative as part of the UN Zambia support to the Government’s response to COVID-19. UNDP hopes that by collectively rethinking and adapting existing market models to COVID-19 Compliant Models, community behaviour will be positively impacted, thus leading to the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 arising from community ownership while preserving the livelihoods of communities.

Title: Airtel Zambia & UN Capital Development Fund partner to strengthen digital financial services across the country
Content: 17 February 2021
Lusaka, February 4th, 2021 - Airtel Networks Zambia Plc and the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) have announced a partnership named the ‘Last Mile Distribution’ project designed to bring digital financial services closer to Zambians living in remote areas across the country through Airtel Money.
The Last Mile Distribution project which will be implemented in 6 Provinces include the Copperbelt, North Western, Luapula, Western, Northern and
Southern and aims to provide connectivity of Airtel Money to every site. To aid the project’s success, Airtel Money will improve on the number of products and services for Airtel Money customers in these sites especially targeting those who previously were unable to connect to Airtel Money.
Airtel Money will also provide their agents with an innovative access to electronic float (E-Float) with the aim of improving their transactions and enhancing limits which will help them serve their customers with ease.
Speaking on the new project, Airtel Money Director, James Chona said he is confident the partnership will improve digital finance and inclusivity within the two provinces.
“We are excited to launch the ‘Last Mile Distribution’ with the UNCDF. This project aims to provide digital financial services to Zambians living in deep rural and remote areas. The project builds on the investment we have made in the country over the years by building necessary infrastructure thus, expanding digital finance and providing the necessary support to achieving financial inclusion. COVID-19 has been a major drive to this project, and we are willing to do more to make sure that our customers can transact without any hindrances.” Mr Chona said.
And UNCDF Country Lead Isaac Holly said: “To successfully promote digital economies that leave no one behind, UNCDF depends on partnerships. We know we cannot do this work alone. Partnerships are important to us. We partnered with Airtel in the past, and working together again shows how meaningful our collaboration has been. This new collaboration with Airtel is one that improves digital and financial inclusion for Zambians living in remote or hard-to-reach areas.”
The ‘Last Mile Distribution’ project will be integral to increase financial inclusion and improve rural digital financial literacy. In addition, agents can now receive e -float necessary to run their Airtel Money shops and reduces their dormancy rates thereby increasing their profitability and boosts their community’s economy.
The Airtel Money and UNCDF partnership is integral to building a cashless economy in rural areas and further supports the Government of Zambia’s effort to curb COVID-19. It further improves the circulation of money in the country with a focus of building a more robust digital financial service industry.

Title: UN Food Systems Summit opens global conversations to crowdsource sustainable solutions
Content: 25 November 2020
UN Special Envoy invites all sectors of society to share their perspectives and solutions for food systems that are fit for the future.
25 NOVEMBER 2020, NAIROBI – The process allowing everyone around the world to contribute to a milestone UN event on food systems was today opened by the UN Special Envoy for the 2021 Food Systems Summit.
The Food Systems Summit Dialogues are critical to the engagement process and offer a purposeful and organized forum for stakeholders to come together to share evidence, experiences and new ideas to transform the way the world produces, consumes and disposes of food.
There are three types of Dialogues: UN Member State, Global Events, and Independent, with this last one allowing individuals and institutions to hold their own Dialogue within their own communities.
Throughout the process, the Dialogues will feed in to the Summit’s five priority areas, or Action Tracks, and the preparatory work of its scientific and advisory groups to ensure a dynamic and harmonized global push to leverage changes in our food systems to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Dialogue participants can step forward to indicate how they will contribute, with a view to foster new actions and partnerships and amplify existing initiatives.
“I am delighted to announce the start of the Food Systems Summit Dialogues because this is an exciting opportunity to share the floor with everyone who cares about making food systems more equitable and sustainable,” said Dr. Agnes Kalibata, the UN Secretary General’s Special Envoy for the 2021 Food Systems Summit. “The Summit will only be effective at setting out the pathway to 2030 if we successfully leverage the collective knowledge and experience of the broadest possible cross-section of the population.”
The Summit process will draw on the best evidence, ideas, and experiences from around the world to inform new, more sustainable directions for food systems. The Food Systems Summit Dialogues use a standardized approach to convening, curating and facilitating structured conversations among groups with different perspectives on how to get their food systems to work for the common good and that are based on local realities.
The Secretariat for the Food Systems Summit has brought onboard a team in the Geneva-based social enterprise 4SD, led by Dr. David Nabarro, to oversee this ambitious Food Systems Summit Dialogues process.
“We all have to be part of the movement for change if we are to improve our food systems. As we widen our connections and deepen our interactions through a multi-stakeholder dialogue process, our perspectives shift – we establish new forms of alliance and new solutions. With the Food Systems Summit Dialogues, we have established a process of change that can accommodate multiple perspectives and make sure that we all hear as many voices as possible.” Dr. Nabarro said.
The first Global Food Systems Summit Dialogue will take place on December 1, hosted by the 3rd global conference of the Sustainable Food Systems Programme of the UN One Planet network. The Dialogue will aim to yield recommendations on actionable measures that can address the complex, interrelated challenges in our food systems across a range of identified priority areas: collaborative action mechanisms, scientific challenges of food systems metrics, holistic policies, investing in transformative initiatives, public procurement, and consumer behaviour change. The event will be co-convened by Dr. Kalibata, Costa Rica, Switzerland and WWF. The One Planet Sustainable Food Systems conference will share the outcomes of this Dialogue as an early contribution into relevant action tracks of the Food Systems Summit.
The Food Systems Summit is convened by the Secretary-General of the UN as part of the Decade of Action to achieve the SDGs by 2030. The Summit will help establish the future direction for food systems in our world and inspire action to help all people get there. With only 10 years remaining, many of the 17 SDGs remain far out of reach.
With its activities spread over more than a year, the Summit will bring together key players from the worlds of science, business, policy, healthcare and academia, as well as farmers, indigenous people, youth organizations, consumer groups, environmental activists, and more. This is an opportunity to engage all citizens as food system stakeholders, and bring about tangible, positive changes to the world’s food systems.

Title: Zambian peacekeeper awarded 2020 United Nations Woman Police Officer of the Year
Content: 30 October 2020
Like many peacekeepers during this challenging time, Chief Inspector Malambo continues to go above and beyond the call of duty to serve our communities,” said United Nations Police Adviser Luis Carrilho.

Zambian peacekeeper awarded 2020 United Nations Woman Police Officer of the Year

New York, Friday, 30 October 2020 – The UN Department of Peace Operations announced that Chief Inspector Doreen Malambo of Zambia, currently serving in the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) will be awarded the 2020 United Nations Woman Police Officer of the Year.
Chief Inspector Malambo currently serves as a Gender Adviser in Juba, South Sudan. Working with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), she helped establish the Stand Up for Rights of Women and Girls initiative that has helped to reduce and prevent sexual and gender-based crime in South Sudan. As part of this project, Chief Inspector Malambo created a network of groups led by male local police officers to engage other men in the community to disseminate information and promote the protection and advancement of the rights of women and girls.
Chief Inspector Malambo also contributed to UNMISS’ efforts to disseminate information on COVID-19 prevention to vulnerable communities, including those with disabilities.
The United Nations Woman Police Officer of the Year award was established in 2011 to recognize the exceptional contributions of women police officers to UN peace operations and to promote the empowerment of women.
The award carries special significance this year when we mark the 20th anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security and 60 years since the first deployment of United Nations police, to the United Nations Operation in the Congo.
“Greater women’s participation in peacekeeping sends a strong message to our host populations. This message is amplified when women police officers like Chief Inspector Malambo take the lead to empower and protect others, even more so in a pandemic context” said Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix, who will present her with the award at a virtual ceremony on 3 November 2020. “Through both her ideas and actions Doreen Malambo exemplifies the best of United Nations policing.”
“Like many peacekeepers during this challenging time, Chief Inspector Malambo continues to go above and beyond the call of duty to serve our communities,” said United Nations Police Adviser Luis Carrilho. “Gender-responsive policing is a responsibility shared by all, and her efforts within the Mission and in the community to engage more men have led to greater awareness of the role each of us can play,” Carrilho added.
“Knowing that I am making a difference by working to empower women and promote their active inclusion and participation in society motivates me. Women’s empowerment is the key to increasing the visibility of interests, concerns, needs and contributions of women as we advance the Women, Peace and Security agenda,” said Chief Inspector Doreen Malambo.
Chief Inspector Doreen Malambo’s previous UN experience includes a deployment with the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) from 2008 to 2009, where she assisted the Liberia National Police to prevent and investigate sexual and gender-based violence and domestic violence. Her national experience spans 24 years with the Zambia Police Service.
The award will be presented during the 15th United Nations Police Week that will take place virtually from 2 to 6 November. At this annual event, heads of UN police components and police experts from peacekeeping operations, special political missions and regional offices and United Nations senior leadership discuss performance, conduct and discipline, protection of civilians, conflict prevention, sustaining peace and other topics and priorities affecting United Nations policing.
About 11,000 UN police, 1,300 of whom are women, are deployed in 16 United Nations peace operations today to enhance international peace and security by supporting host countries in conflict, post-conflict and other crisis situations.
The United Nations’ goal is to deploy 30% women among individual police officers and 20% among formed police units by 2028.

Title: UN Press Release on Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE)
Content: 06 October 2020
PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

UN welcomes Vice-President’s announcement of a technical review to address rumours on CSE Framework in Zambia
Lusaka, 06 October 2020: The United Nations (UN) in Zambia commends the Government of the Republic of Zambia for its announcement that the Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) curriculum would be subjected to a multisectoral technical review. The recent statement by Her Honour the Vice President of the Republic of Zambia, Ms. Inonge Mutukwa Wina, MP, provides a way forward, a platform for more discussion of the national CSE Framework, and an opportunity for all actors to find out more about the content of the Framework and results from its implementation.
The UN believes that the CSE Framework provides an important tool to address early and unintended pregnancies, HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), child marriage and Gender-Based Violence in Zambia. The UN stands ready to provide support to the Government of the Republic of Zambia on the planned review.
The UN believes that children and young people should have access to accurate, factual, age- and culturally-appropriate information about relationships as they transition to adulthood. Contrary to recent rumours and misleading information circulating on social media, the CSE Framework (2014) was developed by the Government of the Republic Zambia through a thorough and consultative process involving education sector stakeholders, traditional leaders, faith-based groups and Civil Society Organisations, resulting in an age-appropriate curriculum respecting Zambian cultural values. The CSE Framework in Zambia has been delivered to learners as part of examinable subjects and not as a standalone subject.

UN75: The Future We Want, The UN We Need

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the UN’s worldwide consultation reveals a strong call for action on inequalities and climate change, as well as more solidarity
In January 2020, the United Nations launched the global consultation to mark its 75th anniversary. Through surveys and dialogues, it asked people about their hopes and fears for the future – representing the UN’s most ambitious effort to date to understand expectations of international cooperation and of the UN in particular.   It is also the largest survey to date on priorities for recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of 21 September 2020, over a million people from all countries and all walks of life had taken part. Their answers provide unique insights into what the public wants at this challenging time for the world. They are released today to coincide with the UN General Assembly’s official commemoration of the 75th anniversary, held under the banner: the future we want, the UN we need. Key findings include:

Priorities for action

Perceptions of the UN

“Across this anniversary year, we have engaged in a global conversation. And the results are striking. People are thinking big – they are also expressing an intense yearning for international cooperation and global solidarity. Now is the time to respond to these aspirations and realize these aims. In this 75th anniversary year, we face our own 1945 moment. We must meet that moment. We must show unity like never before to overcome today’s emergency, get the world moving and working and prospering again, and uphold the vision of the Charter.” - United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres

Title: UN  Statement on COVID-19 Emergency Cash Transfers
Content: 01 September 2020
Lusaka, 1 September 2020: The United Nations (UN) in Zambia has noted with concern recent media reports on the COVID-19 Emergency Cash Transfer programme (ECT). This is a Government programme which the UN is supporting through the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services (MCDSS), in keeping with the UN’s core values and principles of neutrality and impartiality with utmost respect for national sovereignty and ownership with a clear focus of leaving no one behind. The UN wishes to clarify as follows:
Within the framework the Government’s Social Protection Agenda, the UN has been supporting the Social Cash Transfer (SCT) programme, targeting the most poor and vulnerable in the communities, through technical assistance and mobilisation of resources. The SCT programme has been running in Zambia since 2003. The UN Joint Programme on Social Protection involves a number of UN agencies – UNICEF, WFP, ILO and UNDP.
In the recent past, the SCT programme has been expanded to address the impact of natural disasters and COVID-19 on lives and livelihoods through separate Emergency Cash Transfer initiatives. In response to the drought conditions in many parts of the country in 2019, the UN supported the MCDSS with short term Emergency Cash Transfers to 92,202 households based on those already registered in the SCT programme, selected in 23 drought-affected districts.
As part of the Government of Zambia’s COVID-19 response plan, and in line with the UN Zambia’s COVID-19 Emergency Appeal (food security and social protection pillars), the UN is now supporting the Government on a supplementary short-term Emergency Cash Transfer programme for vulnerable households affected by COVID-19. This programme will make monthly payments per household of 400 Kwacha over six months.
As stated above, the beneficiaries in this programme will be made up in part by those already registered in the SCT scheme, and additional households identified as either vulnerable or food insecure. To ensure careful targeting of the beneficiaries, it was agreed with the Government, among others, that this would be done in phases, preceded by a validated database of beneficiaries and a tight payment system. In total, the COVID-19 ECT programme will cover 18 districts and reach an estimated 249,200 households (approximately 1.2 million people).
The public has also been alerted to alleged activities being carried out by fraudsters who solicit money from the public in return for the promise of a future payment.
The UN wishes to condemn any attempt at derailing this very important social assistance programme. No potential ECT beneficiary is charged any registration fee. The UN will continue to support the Government to ensure that the right beneficiaries receive the necessary financial support they so deserve under the current difficult situation.

Title: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Contributes COVID-19 Testing and Detection kits to Zambia
Content: 30 July 2020
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has contributed to the Government of the Republic of Zambia’s efforts to fight against COVID-19 by building national capacities to diagnose the virus using real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for the testing and rapid detection of COVID-19 through support from the United States Government. The donation follows a request made by the Ministry of Higher Education for IAEA to support Zambia with testing kits.
Speaking during a virtual handover ceremony on 29 July 2020, Ministry of Higher Education Permanent Secretary Ms Kayula Siame noted that the equipment will support Zambia’s COVID-19 response.
“When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in Zambia, as Government we reached out to the IAEA for support and are grateful to the IAEA and the American Government for the provision of the equipment which includes scanners, centrifuge sample extraction kits and accessories. The equipment will go a long way as part of our multisectoral approach to
fighting the pandemic,” said Ms Siame.
In a vote of thanks, Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary for Technical Services Dr. Kennedy Malama expressed gratitude to the IAEA, the United Nations system and the United States Government for supporting the COVID-19 response in Zambia. He said that the equipment would enhance Zambia’s capacity to detect and manage COVID-19.
“As you know with COVID-19 you can only manage that which you know. This donation comes at the right time when we need to ramp up our testing for COVID-19. IAEA has been a strategic partner in diagnostic services, training and research in Zambia,” said Dr Malama.
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Chief of Laboratory and Infrastructure Support in Zambia Dr Samuel Yingst said that the donation was part of the US Government’s partnership with the Zambian Government in the health sector.
“CDC has provided substantial support in the area of diagnostics as an extension of years of collaboration with Zambia. We appreciate the opportunity for future collaboration. We pledge to work diligently with the ministries of Health and Higher Education to help to utilize this donation and bring our collaborative human resources to bare in the best possible way to counter this disease,” said Dr Yingst.
Meanwhile, World Health Organisation Representative to Zambia Dr Nathan Bakyaita who spoke on behalf of the UN Resident Coordinator Dr. Coumba Mar Gadio, acknowledged the Zambian Government’s commitment to fighting COVID-19 and pledged the United Nation’s continued support in the response.
“I wish to acknowledge the Government of Zambia’s leadership and commitment in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, a matter on which the UN remains available to support whenever needed,” Dr Bakyaita said.
Dr Bakyaita said that the UN support to the COVID-19 response in Zambia included working with the Government to develop a multisectoral contingency and response plan, cash grants to vulnerable people, Risk Communication and Community Engagement, upgrading water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, nutrition, food security and education.
And IAEA Director, Division for Africa Mr. Shaukat Abdulrazak who represented the IAEA Director General Mr. Rafael Grossi, said that the IAEA received requests for assistance from 42 African countries in fighting COVID-19.
“I am happy to report that we have so far delivered RT-PCR and other equipment to over 28 Member States in Africa out of the 42 that have requested for support. Other equipment is in the process of being procured and shipped. Zambia is receiving one set today and the second one is on the way. We express our gratitude to the Government of the United States of America for ensuring that this support is made possible. IAEA will continue to support Zambia and other African Member States to address their priority development needs through the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology,” said Mr. Abdulrazak.
The first case of COVID-19 in Zambia was recorded on 18 March 2020. As at 29 July 2020, Zambia had 5,249 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 138 deaths. The Government of the Republic of Zambia is in partnership with cooperating partners implementing a multisectoral response to the pandemic.

Title: UN System in Zambia Launches COVID-19 Emergency Appeal
Content: 15 May 2020
The UN COVID-19 Emergency Appeal, which is aimed at reducing the impact of COVID-19 on 6.2 million vulnerable people in the country during the period May to October 2020, seeks immediate funding of USD133 million to meet the needs of the most vulnerable people in Zambia.
PRESS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

UN System in Zambia Launches COVID-19 Emergency Appeal

USD133 million needed to support 6 million vulnerable people from May to October

Lusaka, 15 May 2020: The UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia Dr Coumba Mar Gadio and Zambia’s Vice-President Ms Inonge Wina this morning jointly launched the UN COVID-19 Emergency Appeal and the Government Multisectoral COVID-19 Response Plan with a call for support to reduce the impact of the pandemic on 6 million people in the country.
The launch was witnessed in person by Cabinet Ministers from Health, Finance, National Development Planning, Information and Broadcasting, Home affairs, Office of the Vice President, members of the diplomatic corps, cooperating partners and other stakeholders such as Faith Based Organisations and the private sector who joined virtually due to COVID- 19 guidelines on gatherings.
The UN COVID-19 Emergency Appeal, which is aimed at reducing the impact of COVID-19 on 6.2 million vulnerable people in the country during the period May to October 2020, seeks immediate funding of USD133 million to meet the needs of the most vulnerable people in Zambia.
The UN will work with 27 partners comprising 9 United Nations agencies, 11 International Non-Governmental Organisations and 7 local Non-Governmental Organisations across 11 sectors namely food security, social protection, COVID-19 public health, education, health and WASH sectors. Others are Risk Communication and Community Engagement, immediate economic support, nutrition, protection and governance.
The appeal complements the Government of Zambia’s COVID-19 Multisectoral Contingency and Response Plan focusing on strengthening preparedness and response to COVID-19 also launched at the same event by Zambia’s Republican Vice-President Ms Inonge Mutukwa Wina, MP.
The Vice President called for support by all stakeholders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic that had reshaped life as known before.
“Who then should come out and help? The answer is that each one of us must gather courage, stand up and be counted because a human crisis of the scale of COVID-19 calls for support from both from within and outside our comfort zone no matter how small the contribution may be,” said Ms Wina
Also speaking at the at the event, UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Dr Coumba Mar Gadio called on cooperating partners and the private sector to support the appeal.
“I would like kindly request Cooperating Partners to support the UN Emergency Appeal whose purpose is to facilitate the operationalization and implementation of the COVID-19 Multisectoral Contingency and Response Plan. Your financial support will be critical to enable the UN and implementing partners on the ground to deliver timely and adequate lifesaving interventions to respond to and put preventive measures in place to stop the further spread of the virus,” said Dr Gadio.
The Minister of Finance Bwalya Ng’andu said that COVID-19 had been projected to affect the growth of the Zambian economy, hence the need for concerted efforts to assist the most vulnerable people in society. And Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya noted that the pandemic was a global health emergency with serious consequences on the socio-economic development and sustainable development.
The United Nations Emergency Appeal for Zambia prioritizes the most urgent and lifesaving interventions necessary to reduce the impact of COVID-19. In particular, the appeal promotes multisectoral support for populations affected by COVID -19 primary and secondary impacts.
Under the lead of World Health Organisation (WHO), the United Nations has supported the Government on the development of a multisectoral contingency plan and assessment of the socio-economic impact of the pandemic in Zambia. The UN will continue supporting the Government with resource mobilisation to provide timely and adequate responses.
With support from cooperating partners, the UN has contributed to ongoing efforts by the Government including training of technical staff and helping strengthen surveillance in communities, procurement of personal protective equipment and essential medicines, promoting Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in health facilities and strengthening infection prevention and control.
Additional support has gone towards strengthening health systems to effectively deliver health services, including supporting human resources for health to provide antenatal care, safe delivery and addressing sexual and Gender-Based Violence, which increases in times of crises.

Title: Open Challenge Prize Announced at the Systems Innovation Workshop for Catalytic Funding Initiatives in Zambia
Content: 28 March 2017
The SDG Philanthropy Platform and the UN in Zambia hosted an interactive, collaborative workshop to identify pathways for innovations which can lead to transformative solutions for children in Zambia. This workshop brought together over 30 participants from the government, social enterprises, businesses, innovators, faith based organizations and NGO's with the aim of brainstorming and generating ideas for innovation opportunities, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals related to children.

Facilitated by Banny Banerjee, Director of Stanford University Change Labs, workshop participants explored the theme of systems- analysis, an approach that enables deeper collaboration and integrating innovations for high-impact solutions. Participants identified leverage points, where more organizations and people can use their investment decisions in order to shift the needle on the well-being of children in Zambia. Key opportunities for innovation that were identified were child protection, particularly of the girl child, early child marriages, and employment and income generation opportunities as well as education and health care services, with a strong emphasis on focusing on the community level.

“The well-being of children can only be achieved through collaboration and partnerships that range across sectors” said Banny Banerjee, Director of Stanford University Change Labs.

An advisory body to the Challenge Prize will be set up with representatives from the government, civil society, philanthropy and the private sector. They will use insights from the workshop as an input to launch a $130,000 challenge prize for three or four organizations who come up with ideas for solutions per agreed criteria.

Mr. Maybin Nsupila, National Coordinator, SDG PP Zambia emphasized that partnerships are essential to achieve the SDGs and commended philanthropy’s leadership in collaborating on the goals. The new SDG Philanthropy Platform SDG Ecosystem site www.sdgphilanthropy.org recently launched, helps philanthropists and social investors engage in the country to help achieve SDGs.

The SDG Philanthropy Platform enables strong partnerships between philanthropic organizations, the United Nations and other development partners, governments, civil society, businesses, and social enterprises in achieving the SDGs. The Platform is a collaboration between philanthropy and the greater international development community, led by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors and Foundation Center, and supported by the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Ford Foundation, The MasterCard Foundation, Brach Family Charitable Foundation, and UN Foundation. The Platform has been launched in Kenya, Zambia, Ghana, Colombia, Indonesia, India and the United States.

Title: UN Joint Statement World Population Day
Content: 11 July 2013
UN ZAMBIA JOINT STATEMENT ON WORLD POPULATION DAY

World Population Day, commemorated each year on July 11 July, brings to the fore the demographic trends, dividends and challenges that impact societies the world over. The theme for this year is ‘adolescent pregnancy’. This is a topic that affects us all as policy makers, parents, teachers, students and friends.
Globally, too many of the estimated 16 million teenage girls who give birth each year never had the opportunity to plan their pregnancy. In Zambia, over 30% of 15-19 year old girls have already been pregnant or have had a child. This is an alarming rate of pregnancy among adolescents. Zambia’s 2013 MDG Report indicates early marriage and adolescent pregnancy as two main triggers for the high maternal mortality rate in the country. 42% of Zambian women are married before the age of 18. Thirty eight mothers die each month due to complications relating to pregnancy and child birth. And many of these mothers are teenagers. Unsafe abortions, obstetric fistula, hemorrhage and malnutrition often result in young mothers facing a heightened risk of maternal complications, death and disability. Their children, even when surviving birth, face higher risks as well.
“Adolescent pregnancy is an abrupt disruption to education, and an end to childhood. Keeping girls safe and in secondary school, enforcing laws that deter early marriage and harshly punish rape, and the active promotion and access to birth control and reproductive health education – this is what will break this cycle” said Kanni Wignaraja, the UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Representative.
Education and staying in school plays a major role in changing this situation. It creates awareness, it delays marriage and childbearing, and it reduces the otherwise high fertility rate. A Zambian woman with no formal education has a fertility rate of 8; with one year of secondary this halves to 4; and then it halves again to 2.4 with one year of tertiary education. This pattern also correlates with infant and child health. The better the education of the mother, the healthier the child. Good quality reproductive health services that cover family planning and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, must be readily available in order for adolescent boys and girls to make informed and healthy choices about the onset of sexual relations, pregnancy and child spacing.
On this World Population Day, the UN in Zambia calls on the government and all stakeholders to help make the right public policy choices and to invest resources in the education, health and wellbeing of adolescent girls. Every young girl, regardless of where she lives, her economic or social circumstances, has the right to enjoy and fulfill her potential. Today, too many girls in Zambia and across the world are denied that right. We can change that.

Title: UN Joint Statement-National Youth Policy Review
Content: 04 June 2013
Martin Clemensson, Director, International Labour Organization
National Youth Policy Review
Honourable Minister for Youth and Sport
The Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Youth and Sport Directors and Senior Government Officials
Members of the diplomatic corps Media colleagues,
Distinguished guests Ladies and gentlemen,
I am delighted to be with you today at this important National Youth Policy Review Consultative Meeting.
With 52 per cent of persons below 18 years and 38 per cent between 15-35 years, Zambia is blessed with a youthful population. And in that simple statement lies both extraordinary challenges to be addressed, and extraordinary possibilities for making youth a critical resource for development in the years ahead.
While many countries around the world are aging in their demographic profile and looking outside to find workers, Zambia is endowed with a growing cohort of young people with the energy, the talent and the motivation to build Zambia, a prosperous middle income country by 2030. The potential here is indeed extraordinary.
National youth literacy has improved from 75 per cent in 1990 to 89 per cent in 2010. It has increased faster for girls, by 15 percentage points in the same period, than for boys,
by 12 percentage points. The proportion of young people with comprehensive knowledge of HIV and AIDS has improved from 31 per cent in 2002 to 40 in 2009.
However, it is equally true that in these numbers lie real challenges as well. To what extent will this energy and dynamism be harnessed - or will this opportunity be squandered? Or worse, redirected to push development gains backward?
Three young Zambians, of whom two are girls, continue to get infected with HIV every hour. 42 per cent of girls are married before the age of 18 years; 28 per cent of total pregnancies are among girls aged 13-17 years, leading to high maternal mortality as a result of unsafe abortions among young women.
Zambia’s extraordinary economic growth in the past few years has not yet contributed to job creation. High levels of unemployment especially among youth are worrying. Young people of 15–35 years, account for 65 per cent of the working age population and yet, only 28 per cent of the economically active youth (over 1.2 million) were unemployed – almost double the national average of 15 percent in 2008.
We must better understand these issues faced by Zambia’s young people, and prepare better and smarter responses to address them.
An excellent engagement of young people in recently concluded Zambia’s consultations on the Post-2015 Development Agenda must be recognized as a statement by youth of their willingness to be agents of change to shape the future they want for a rapidly growing Zambia.
As underlined by the young Zambians, quality education with life skills is the most important vehicle for the sustainable development. We must aspire to design our policies to grow a highly educated youth population, which can transform themselves, the country and the world.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Being a ‘good citizen’ is an acquired skill; it is a process that evolves over a lifetime. Young people must be included at the earliest in this process of citizenship. Young people need sufficient attention by policy makers. A successful nation depends on it.
It is Zambia’s youth that will ultimately build a prosperous Zambia. They need to be heard as the blue-prints are developed or reviewed. Their ideas and inputs on how to develop a more just and fairer society are vital. We need to get their advice on how best to formulate policies and programmes meant to address their needs and concerns. They need to tell us when we are coming up short and hopefully pat us on the back when we get it right!
It is highly commendable that the Ministry of Youth and Sport has initiated this very important task of reviewing the 2006 National Youth Policy. The UN in Zambia, including ILO, is confident that this review process will lead to a revision of the Youth Policy, making it more relevant and also in line with emerging international, regional and national trends in youth development. We are hopeful that these consultative meetings in Lusaka as well as in other provinces will provide solid feedback to the process.
I am very pleased to be part of this process, and wish the Ministry of Youth and Sport, and all participants my best wishes to have productive sessions.
Thank You.

Title: UN Zambia Statement on Press Freedom Day
Content: 03 May 2013
Safe to Speak: Securing Freedom of Expression in All Media

Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, enshrined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is a cornerstone of good governance, sustainable development, and lasting peace and security.

Yet, every day around the world, journalists and media workers are frequent targets of violence. They face intimidation, threats and violence from governments, corporations, criminals or other forces that wish to silence or censor. From traditional media platforms such as radio, print and television, to newer and more and more popular social media, blogs and citizen-led reporting, journalists are increasingly at risk.

“Freedom of expression is a fundamental right and provides conditions for protecting and promoting all human rights. To exercise this right, we must all help create and protect a safe environment for dialogue, where all can speak freely and openly even if ideas and ideologies differ, without fear of reprisal,” said UN Resident Coordinator in Zambia, Kanni Wignaraja.

The theme of this year’s World Press Freedom Day, “Safe to Speak: Securing Freedom of Expression in All Media”, highlights the need for action to upholding the right of journalists to carry out their vital work. “Today, twentieth anniversary of the World Press Freedom Day is an opportunity to renew our commitments. Let us pledge to do our utmost to enable all journalists in all media to do their jobs. When it is safe to speak, the whole world benefits.” said the UN Secretary General in a message.

Globally, the UN system has established a Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity. The plan aims to raise awareness and to support practical steps to create a free and safe working environment for journalists.

Over the past decade, more than 600 journalists have been killed – at least 120 in the past year alone. Hundreds more have been detained. The dangers are not only physical: from cyber-attacks to bullying, the powerful are deploying numerous tools to try to stop the media from shedding light on misrule and misdeeds. These are individual tragedies; collectively, they are an assault on the right of all people to the truth. The UN is especially concerned that so many of the perpetrators escape any form of  punishment.

The UN in Zambia congratulates the Government of Republic of Zambia (GRZ) for assuming the role of the Chair of the UN Committee on Information for the next two years. Zambia will also represent all African countries in the committee. We look forward to the active promotion and protection of the right to freedom of expression and ensuring all people feel “Safe to Speak” across the country and in the region.

Title: UN Zambia Statement on World Malaria Day
Content: 25 April 2013
Malaria prevalence has reduced, but three children continue to die of malaria every day

25 April, 2013, Lusaka, Zambia – The 2013 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Report for Zambia, which will be launched on 7 May, brings out significant progress made, as well as needed areas for acceleration of gains. One of these critical issues is malaria. Three children die of Malaria every day. These are preventable deaths.
Since the world leaders adopted the MDGs in 2000, increase in preventive interventions and expanded access to diagnostic testing and life-saving medicines have averted more than a million deaths from malaria globally. Zambia is among those countries, which has made a significant progress in reducing malaria prevalence under 5 children from 16.1 per cent in 2010 to 14.3 per cent in 2012, according to the preliminary results of the National Malaria Indicator Survey 2012. Over 4.7 million cases of malaria were treated at health facilities and 6.1 million Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDTs) kits were distributed to health facilities in 2012 alone.
The percentage of pregnant women and children under the age of five sleeping under the treated mosquito net have also increased from 45 per cent and 50 per cent in 2010 to about 60 per cent and 57 period in 2012 respectively. Zambia was awarded with the African leaders Malaria Alliance Award by the United Nations in recognition of the Country’s achievements in reducing malaria infection rate.
On average, each Zambian household had two mosquito nets, and 68 per cent of households had at least one mosquito net. The average rural household have at least three mosquito nets while the urban household has two nets. At least 74 per cent have nets sprayed with long lasting insecticide whilst this coverage is 63 per cent amongst the wealthiest quintile. It is commendable to note that the mosquito net coverage is higher among rural households, the poor, women and children under 5. Despite this progress, half of women population 9 (49 per cent) and over half of men (53 per cent) do not sleep under the treated nets in Zambia.
To improve this and to sustain the gains made in malaria control and prevention by Zambia, there is a need to scale up and accelerate malaria prevention efforts to focus on the most vulnerable populations affected in high malarial areas. This is mostly in rural areas, with little access to health clinics. So community management of prevention and care is an investment that must happen. This is in line with this year’s theme on World Malaria Campaign – “Invest in the Future.”
Controlling malaria does more than improve human health. It boosts a country’s economic and human development. The UN urges the regional and national leadership to maintain their commitment to provide universal access to malaria interventions and end disability and deaths caused by this preventable and treatable disease.

Title: UN Zambian 1000 Days Press statement
Content: 05 April 2013
UN Zambia calls for accelerated action with 1,000 days to go on Millennium Development Goals

5 April, 2013, Lusaka, Zambia— The United Nations in Zambia is today observing the milestone of 1,000 days to the end of 2015 – the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Starting today (5 April) – the actual milestone date – through to Friday 12 April, UN offices around the world are working with governments, civil society and international partners to mark “MDG Momentum: 1,000 Days of Action” in a variety of ways.
“The MDGs are the most successful global anti-poverty push in history,” UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon said. “The Goals have helped set global and national priorities, mobilize action, and achieve remarkable results.”
The eight time-bound MDGs address poverty and hunger, education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, combatting AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental sustainability and a global partnership for development.
In Madrid, Spain, the Secretary-General and young people from the Spanish and European Youth Councils observed the moment at a special event today, joined by UNDP Administrator Helen Clark and other heads of UN agencies and programmes who were visiting for a senior-level UN meeting.
Since the MDGs were adopted by all UN Member States in 2000, governments, international organizations and civil society groups around the world have helped make tremendous progress to improve people’s lives.
Zambia has witnessed steady progress on a number of MDG targets. The country has already attained the primary education target with about 94 per cent of school enrolment rate and the national HIV prevalence rate, which is below the 15.6 per cent target.
Challenges remain in meeting other targets such as those on adult literacy, maternal and child mortality, sanitation and achieving gender parity in higher education. There is a very high drop-out rate (2/3 of those enrolled do not complete grade 12) at the secondary level and HIV incidence rate (three per hour, two of whom are women) is alarming. MDG one remains one of the toughest to budge, with 42 per cent of Zambians still living in extreme poverty, and the MDG target of reducing this to 29 per cent is a  long ways off.
To build on the success achieved and accelerate action, the Secretary-General called on the international community to: increase targeted investments in health, education, energy and sanitation; empower women and girls; focus on the most vulnerable people; keep up aid commitments; and re-energize efforts from governments to grassroots groups to make a difference.
The 1,000-day milestone is an opportunity to amplify awareness of MDG achievements and the commitment to continue global progress, including Zambia
“Zambia’s economic growth has been promising in recent years; building on this success, now it is crucial for Zambia to provide a laser-focus on those areas where it is lagging behind to achieve the MDGs by 2015,” the UN Resident Coordinator and the UNDP Resident Representative in Zambia, Ms. Kanni Wignaraja said.
Forty-five countries are now using the MDG Acceleration Framework to identify pragmatic solutions to speed up progress on lagging MDGs, and to reduce disparities in progress to date. “The more the world can achieve on the MDGs, the more it will be possible to build confidence and support for a bold and ambitious post-2015 development agenda,” the UN Development Group chair and UNDP Administrator Helen Clark said.
#MDGmomentum
Social media is playing a major role in observing the milestone and promoting MDG momentum and the need to rally the world to step up efforts to achieve the eight Goals as 2015 approaches.
Today, UN Zambia is also taking part in a 1,000-minute #MDGMomentum Twitter Rally as part of a joint, global campaign with UN and international organizations.
The UN’s MDG gateway has a dedicated page promoting the various social media materials and initiatives being organized by a number of UN agencies and partners. The website is: www.un.org/millenniumgoals.
