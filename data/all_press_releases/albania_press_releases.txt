Title: Upholding Human Dignity: Advocating for human rights of LGBTIQ+ people on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
17 May 2024
A joint message by the UN and EU Delegation in Albania
On May 17th each year, the world commemorates the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia. This day serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex individuals in Albania and worldwide. Core to the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda, with its goals for 2030, is the principle of leaving no one behind. Translating this promise into tangible realities for individuals, especially those in the LGBTIQ+ community, is an important challenge and there is still much work to be done.
Albania has made considerable progress in the legal framework for protection from discrimination. Albania has a national action plan for the LGBTIQ+ community for the period 2021–2027. Yet despite significant legal strides against discrimination, LGBTIQ+ individuals in Albania continue to face pervasive challenges and marginalization in multiple ways. More needs to be done to achieve full equality, both in law and in practice.
LGBTIQ+ people in Albania share stories of violence, hostility, and a lack of support, both within their families and in broader society. Shocking statistics reveal alarming levels of intolerance among Albanian youth, with a substantial portion expressing reluctance to accept LGBTIQ+ individuals in their schools. Moreover, a concerning majority of people from the LGBTIQ+ community report experiencing psychological violence, perpetuating a cycle of fear and discrimination.
In the workplace, discrimination against LGBTIQ+ individuals remains prevalent, with few businesses implementing inclusive policies or facilitating their employment. This systemic discrimination not only violates fundamental human rights but also hampers societal progress and development.
Efforts to combat this inequality require a multifaceted approach, including improved education, increased public awareness, and ensuring support for those advocating against discriminatory laws.
Families have a crucial role in shaping societal attitudes towards the LGBTIQ+ community, serving as the primary educators of children in matters of tolerance and respect. Children are not born with prejudice; rather, they learn it from the adults around them. By fostering a culture of acceptance and love within Albanian households, families can contribute significantly to creating a more inclusive and compassionate society. It is imperative to promote family acceptance of LGBTIQ+ children and young people by equipping parents with the necessary information and support.
The European Union and United Nations agencies in Albania have supported governmental and oversight institutions to address discrimination against LGBTIQ+ individuals. Through partnerships with civil society organizations, significant progress has been made in promoting respect, tolerance, and diversity.
A partnership with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights led to the implementation of the Free and Equal campaign in Albania. The campaign's essence—led by UNDP—is summarized in a powerful message: LGBTIQ+ rights are human rights. By engaging with the media, training journalists, as well as businesses, and challenging stereotypes, the campaign aims to reshape public narratives and foster a culture of acceptance and respect.
Diversity and inclusion  are not only fundamental human rights but also core values of the European Union. The EU will continue to lead by example, building a Union of Equality, and amplifying the voices of those who defend and promote human rights through the #PrideHeroes campaign. As Albania aspires to become a member of the EU where discrimination on any grounds is prohibited, the country has to demonstrate its commitment to upholding these values by taking concrete actions to address discrimination against LGBTIQ+ individuals. The forthcoming visit to Albania of the UN Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (IE SOGI), is a good opportunity to hear from the community and advance in the realization of human rights for all in the country.
By aligning with EU’s legal protections against discrimination and promoting equality for all citizens, Albania can progress towards its goal of EU membership while fostering a more inclusive and harmonious society.
Achieving change requires collective action from all sectors of society. By challenging prejudice, fostering empathy, and promoting diversity, we can build a future where every individual is valued and free to live authentically.
We call on society not to be silent in the face of discrimination; instead, create an environment free from harassment based on gender identity or sexual orientation.
The fight for human rights of LGBTIQ+ persons is a fundamental struggle for human dignity and equality. We reaffirm our commitment to upholding the rights and dignity of all members of the LGBTIQ+ community, today and every day.

Title: Addressing data gaps will help Albania improve access to water and sanitation for vulnerable and marginalized communities
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
03 April 2024
News from UNECE
Guaranteeing safe access to drinking water and sanitation remains a challenge in the pan-European region, with 16 million people still lacking access to basic drinking water services and over 29 million people not having access to basic sanitation, including hundreds of thousands who have to practice open defecation. The Summary Progress Report on SDG 6 – water and sanitation for all – hence, calls for countries to quadruple the rate of progress to achieve the targets. At the current rate, countries will only achieve safe water and sanitation for all by the 22nd century.
Albania, under the leadership of the Water Resources Management Agency (AMBU) and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and with the support of UNECE, has thus initiated a comprehensive assessment to create a baseline measure of equity to water and sanitation, applying the draft revised Equitable Access Score-card developed under the UNECE-WHO/Europe Protocol on Water and Health. This marks a significant step in the country’s efforts to ensure equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all. Carrying out this self-assessment exercise was also one of Albania's commitments to the Water Action Agenda under the 2023 UN Water Conference.
Lack of data on vulnerable and marginalized communities remains a challenge
The preliminary findings of the self-assessment were presented and discussed with a broad range of stakeholders from government, municipalities, water and sanitation service providers, civil society organizations, and development partners at the Findings workshop on equitable access to water and sanitation in Albania (Tirana, 27 March 2024), highlighting a data gap on vulnerable and marginalized communities and hence reflecting the overall pan-European trend.
Despite a comprehensive governance framework to ensure access to water and sanitation for all with strategies in place, various challenges remain, particularly concerning the affordability of water and sanitation services for the poorest part of the population, the effective application of national strategies at the local level; and the need for further institutional coordination and integrated approach to equity in access to water and sanitation.
Consequently, participants discussed potential solutions and recommendations to ensure equitable access to water and sanitation more effectively, through targeted outreach programmes to identify, assess, and address specific water needs of vulnerable and marginalized communities, including low-income households, rural populations, and minority groups. The workshop outcomes will feed into the finalization of the country report, which will be published on the Protocol's webpage.
Ms. Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator to Albania, emphasized the significance of the assessment, highlighting that its outcomes could be aligned to global and regional processes such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and obligations arising from the EU Directives on water and sanitation, or the European Environment and Health process.
Self-assessment exercise lays the foundation for targeted measures
Ms. Gerta Lubonja, General Director of AMBU, highlighted that the Score-card assessment will guide Albania in implementing evidence-based policies and interventions to drive action on access to water and sanitation, particularly for marginalized and vulnerable communities.
Albania reaffirmed its commitment to the Protocol on Water and Health and its efforts to ensure equitable access to water and sanitation services for all its citizens, and to continued collaboration with international development partners to address challenges identified in an integrated way and achieve the shared goal of realizing the human rights to water and sanitation.
Under the Protocol, several guidance documents and practical tools have been developed to assist countries and other concerned stakeholders in driving action on the water, sanitation, hygiene, and health agenda, in line with global and regional processes such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the European Union Directives, particularly the Drinking Water Directive recast, which emphasizes the need to ensure safe access to water and sanitation for vulnerable and marginalized communities.

Title: UNHCR strengthens its support for refugees and asylum-seekers in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
22 March 2024
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, continues its support to the Albanian authorities in managing the mixed movements of refugees and migrants at the country’s borders. The goal is to ensure that individuals seeking international protection access asylum procedures efficiently and those with specific needs are identified and referred to the relevant national services. This includes children who arrive without their parents or guardians and those unaccompanied and separated who are one of the most at-risk groups arriving at Albania’s borders.
Increasingly around the world, mixed movements occur where refugees and migrants travel along the same routes across land and sea borders. Refugees are specifically defined and protected in international law. These are individuals who have fled their homes to escape persecution, conflict, violence, serious human rights violations or other events seriously disturbing public order, and who seek safety in another country. As a result, they require “international protection” from another country, where their own country of origin is unable or willing to protect them.
Such mixed movements in the Western Balkans are generally comprised of people who have previously transited through a number of countries, including European Union (EU) Member States where they could have sought international protection (and in some instances, may have been granted international protection). Many are compelled to move onward when faced with delays in asylum procedures and/or lack of local integration prospects. Others may intend to join family members in other EU countries or even for perceived better living conditions elsewhere.
A UNHCR partner staff, counselling new arrivals on the Albanian border about asylum procedures, shares the following narrative from a Syrian refugee:
‘I'm from Idlib, Syria. When war started in Syria in 2011, I was 16 years old. One day, while I was around my father’s shop, there was a bombing and that is the day I lost my father. I left on a boat journey with many others on a cold day. I left my wife and daughter with my family, hoping they could join me in a safer place later. The journey was hard and scary. I'm not sure what will happen on this journey, but my dream is to find a safe place.’
In 2023, according to UNHCR protection monitoring data, 4,307 persons arrived at Albania’s borders in mixed movements. This is almost half the number from 2022. More than half came from countries such Afghanistan and Syrian Arab Republic, making up 21% and 20% of the arrivals respectively. Even though fewer people arrived in 2023, the percentage of people who were referred to the asylum process by Albanian authorities increased to 6.5%, up from 2% in 2022. This shows how important it is to have robust asylum systems in place, even during periods of fewer arrivals, to ensure that individuals seeking international protection can access the asylum procedures efficiently.
The legal framework in Albania has made notable progress towards aligning with international and EU standards. However, as with any evolving system, there are opportunities for further enhancement. This includes improving the safeguards in the preliminary screening process to help identify new arrivals in need of protection, better implementing referral mechanisms, particularly for individuals with specific needs, and advancing the professional knowledge and skills of practitioners.
The Strategy for UNHCR Engagement in Mixed Movement in the Western Balkans is the guiding framework for the UNHCR’s work in Albania. This strategy outlines how UNHCR supports national authorities in the Western Balkans in managing the mixed movements to ensure those in need can access international protection and necessary services efficiently.
In Albania, the focus of UNHCR's support includes: i) providing communities with information on asylum procedures and available services, ii) offering technical support to relevant local authorities in identifying individuals with specific needs, and iii) strengthening the capacities of relevant local authorities.
UNHCR partners, Caritas Albania and People’s Advocate, are present at entry points on the border. They provide information to communities in a language they understand. This ensures that anyone who wishes to seek asylum or has specific needs can access relevant and updated information about asylum procedures and available services.
The following is a statement from an Afghan family of six, conveyed to a UNHCR partner staff on the border, after being counselled on their rights and referred to the asylum process.
’ I’m here with my family - my wife and our four precious children, three boys and a girl. We were forced to leave Afghanistan due to ethnic discrimination. Over the last three years, we’ve had to cross many borders. I’ve agreed to work in numerous precarious jobs, all to provide for my family. We’re just seeking a chance to fit in and build a safer life.’
Through its field presence and partner staff, UNHCR supports the Albanian Border and Migration Police in identifying individuals with specific needs, including people with disabilities and unaccompanied or separated children. This collaboration ensures proactive identification and support for these individuals, using prevention and response mechanisms available through public institutions and UNHCR’s NGO partner, Refugee and Migrant Services in Albania (RMSA). The support provided includes services such as medical care, legal assistance, housing, and education.
UNHCR strengthens the capacities of the Border and Migration Police, by providing training and resources. Recent initiatives like the series of workshops organized by the Frontex Fundamental Rights Office in collaboration with UNHCR and the European Union Agency for Asylum, aim to enhance the understanding of international protection and asylum procedures.
Central to UNHCR’s engagement is its collaboration and partnership with the relevant national authorities at various levels, including EU agencies, and local NGOs. A notable example of this collaboration is the ‘IPA III Regional support to protection-sensitive migration management in Western Balkans and Turkey’ project. In Albania, UNHCR collaborates with European Union Agency for Asylum, Frontex, and Internatioanl Organization for Migration as part of this EU-funded multi-country programme.
Moving forward, strengthening collaboration with the relevant authorities at all levels and other partners to ensure efficient access to asylum procedures for individuals seeking international remains key to UNHCR. At the Global Refugee Forum 2023, Albania pledged to decentralizing asylum procedures and ensuring high-quality asylum decisions. UNHCR will persist in its support to fulfil these pledges.

Title: USD 4 million committed to Albania SDG Acceleration Fund by Sweden to further bolster sustainable business practices and raise awareness of the SDGs within the private sector

USD 4 million committed to Albania SDG Acceleration Fund by Sweden to further bolster sustainable business practices and raise awareness of the SDGs within the private sector
An additional $4 Million is confirmed to be added to the Albania's SDG Acceleration Fund, with commitment to encourage sustainable business practices and raise awareness of the SDGs within the private sector in Albania.
As the country pushes towards the European Union and strives to align with EU standards and the aquis, increasing awareness and implementation of sustainable business practices among companies is crucial in driving the country’s economic growth.
The positive outcome of this investment is business’s better alignment with EU standards and production of quality goods suitable for export to EU markets, the creation of decent jobs helping to reduce push factors in migration and helping to address labor shortages, and better business positioning to meet opportunities of growing demand. The introducing of sustainable business practices also means more efficient use of resources, reduction in pollution levels and environmental damage. All these are key factors for a healthier, climate friendly and livable environment.
The committed funds by the Government of Sweden will be allocated to the second phase of the Business Partnerships & Solutions for SDGs—a joint UN Programme in Albania through 2024-27 and will reward and support Albanian businesses to incorporate SDGs into their business models, with initial targeting in the key sectors of agri-business and tourism and the textile, clothing, leather, and footwear industries.  These are sectors of the economy where small and medium enterprises dominate, many women are employed and where the government places priority in enhancing economic performance and employment in Albania.  Work in this area aligns squarely with the end results sought in Strategic Priority B of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2022 – 2026 in pursing sustainable, resilient and green economic growth and resource management.
Building on the activities and lessons learned from the first phase of the Programme, phase II places a strong focus on value chain development tapping the technical experience and core competencies of UNDP, ILO, UNIDO and FAO. FAO and UNDP will be mostly working with Micro and Small Enterprises in the agri sector, while the ILO and UNIDO will also work with medium and large enterprises such as factories and manufacturers. Together, the programme will also work strategically through communication campaigns, targeted events and SDG pioneer awards, to spread awareness on SDGs and sustainable practices mediating with policy makers, as well as building connections and linkages with expertise from Swedish companies, universities, and institutions.
The Albania SDG Acceleration Fund acts as a facilitator, streamlining collaboration between donors and UN agencies. Additionally, it provides an avenue for smaller contributors to participate in more extensive projects, thereby amplifying developmental impacts.
The Albania SDG Acceleration Fund is a key vehicle for joint UN programme delivery in Albania. Established in 2007, since then fifteen partners, including the Government of Albania have contributed more than $75 million to the Fund.  With a focus, following the earthquake in 2019 and the pandemic on supporting joint UN agency interventions in crises response and continued work on driving change in laws, policy and practice to ensure no one is left behind and ending violence against women.   The Fund has also been instrumental in enhancing the strategic alignment and concerted UN efforts for SDG acceleration and has had widespread and tangible outcomes in line with the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.

Title: UN Agencies in Albania kick off 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence and call for bold investments to end violence against women and girls.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
24 November 2023
Government institutions, international organizations, civil society and citizens advocate to end violence against women and girls under the theme "UNITE! Invest to prevent violence against women and girls".
Ahead of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November, United Nations Agencies are asking for increased long-term, sustainable investments from government, private sector, foundations, and other donors to prevent violence against women and girls.
Almost one in two women in Albania have experienced some form of violence during their lifetime. Eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in public and private spaces by 2030 is a specific target and commitment under the Sustainable Development Goals. Investments in prevention are crucial to reach that target, and to achieve gender equality.
Only 27 countries track and have dedicated budgets for gender equality and women’s empowerment. Albania is one of them: The country has budgetary commitments to implement legislation addressing violence against women. For example, 27 million lek will be spent next year to provide free legal aid to 3,700 women and girls, including survivors of domestic violence. 155 million lek are planned to go to the execution of protection orders in favor of women and children. Yet, the Government must unlock financing from different sectors and use gender-responsive budgeting to resource more interventions to prevent violence against women.
A strong and autonomous feminist movement is also a crucial part of the solution. Women’s rights organizations play a pivotal role in preventing violence, advocating for policy change, and holding governments accountable.
16 Days of Activism in Albania
The Ministry of Health and Social protection and UN Agencies in Albania launched the “16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence” in a ceremony paying tribute to the hard work and lifelong commitment of women and men working every day offering a lifeline for survivors and help them rebuild their lives. Civil society activists, men and women within justice institutions, local support services, and international partners were honored for their contribution and support to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls.
Minister of Health and Social Protection, Albana Koçiu said: “There is no excuse for violence against women and girls! There wasn't yesterday, there isn't today and there will never be!”
‘While we say out loud No Excuse! to gender-based violence, we also want to recognize the hundreds of activists and professionals that work hard every day to save lives, give back dignity and hope to survivors, and make prevention a priority.  Together we can end violence against women and girls’, - said Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator in Albania, while recognizing the work of law enforcement and the judiciary.
The 16 Days of Activism is an annual campaign that begins on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and runs through to the International Human Rights Day marked on 10 December.
During the 16 Days, hundreds of events will galvanise public’s attention across Albania, calling for an end to the culture of violence against women. From podcasts to sports events, and awareness raising activities in local communities from north to south, the campaign aims to rally collective action to ensure women and girls can live a life free from fear, symbolized by the colour orange. The activities will be organized by civil society organizations, as well as central and local government institutions, supported by international partners.
UN Agencies will support the campaign also under the umbrella of the Joint Program on Eliminating Violence Against Women in Albania, implemented by UN Women, UNDP and UNFPA with support from Sweden.

Tirana, Albania

In a successful collaboration, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Agricultural University of Tirana have concluded a series of financial literacy training sessions designed to empower
farmers and agricultural extension service specialists in Albania. This initiative was part of the project "Assessing needs and delivering tailored financial literacy training for selected agricultural producers from earthquake-affected areas and extension service specialists in Albania."
The training, which exceeded initial estimates in terms of participation, took place in three target areas. It covered essential topics such as financial literacy, business planning within the agricultural sector, and agricultural support schemes, including IPARD support schemes. The positive response from participants reflects their strong desire to access financial resources for the growth and enhancement of their agricultural businesses. By enhancing the financial literacy of these groups, these training sessions have significantly increased their capacity to pursue financial support opportunities to strengthen their agricultural enterprises.
The process marks the culmination of the entire training program envisioned under the project, highlighting the keen interest and enthusiasm within the Albanian agricultural community, where the gender distribution among participants was approximately 64 percent men and 36 percent women.

Title: Gender Responsive Communications and Unconscious Bias Training for UN staff
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 October 2023
#DevelopingSkills
UN Women Albania, UNFPA Albania and the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office organized today a dedicated training to equip UN personnel working in programme and communications with the skills and knowledge they need to develop, implement and monitor interventions from gender equality and women’s empowerment (GEWE) to help fulfil the commitment made in the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (CF) to mainstream gender equality across all its interventions, as well as promoting GEWE as a stand-alone priority
This training was specifically aimed at increasing the capacities of UN personnel to increase understanding of the meaning and practical impact of gender-responsive and inclusive communications and language; enhance knowledge on how to develop visual, verbal and written communications content and messaging that is gender-responsive and inclusive, and increase awareness of unconscious bias and identify strategies to mitigate their impact.
Following an introduction from GTRG Chair Michele Ribotta and opening remarks from UN Resident Coordinator Fiona McCluney, the training followed with interactive sessions and practical exercises on gender responsive communications, as well as best practices on photographs and linguistic selection. In addition, sessions included practical examples from Albanian news for the participants to reflect over the extent to which they reflected gender equality considerations and fostered a discriminatory narrative about women and girls.
The training was led by Ms. Montira Narkvichien, UN Women Chief of Communications for the Arab States, and Yllka Parllaku, UN Women Albania Communications Officer.
In addition to information-packed presentations, the training encompassed specific issues and recommendations related to the Albanian context, such as the UNCT coming up with a set list of gender-neutral and inclusive alternative terms in Albanian which may be used across the UN system at the outset and to refer to if a roll-out opportunity arises.
Other points of agreement and potential and follow-up actions included using gender sensitive icons and mainstreaming them in the region, strengthening joined effort to allocate resources for monitoring of media.
Participants reported that the training was useful, interesting and valuable in enhancing awareness of gender-responsive communication and unconscious bias. They particularly enjoyed the interactive aspects of the day and group work sessions.
The practical guidelines, recommendations and applicable learnings that came out of the session were identified as particularly useful for participants, as was the importance of understanding and being aware of unconscious biases and recognizing the power of communication and in particular digital communication tools.
Overall, participants reported an increased capacity to communicate in a gender responsive way in daily work and when communicating with partners and reporting results, and a better ability to mitigate the impact of unconscious biases in their messages.

Title: UN Albania runs gender equality marker and human rights marker training
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
16 October 2023
#GenderEquality #HumanRights
The UN Resident Coordinator’s Office and UN Women Albania co-organized an online training on the Gender Equality Marker (GEM) and the Human Rights Marker (HRM). The overall aim of the training was to ensure that the GEM and HR Marker scoring will be accurate for the upcoming Joint Work Planning cycle, which will cover the 2024-2025 period. The training was also an important step for ensuring the accuracy of markers is instrumental for adequately score UNCT SWAP Indicator 6.1, which verifies whether adequate resources for gender mainstreaming are allocated and tracked. To exceed minimum requirements for this indicator, the UNCT must carry out a capacity-building event on the GEM along with establishing and exceeding a financial target for program allocation for gender equality and the empowerment of women.
While acknowledging that a degree of subjectivity is linked to the scoring of the JWP sub-outputs, the training was designed to enhance understanding and awareness of the markers and ensure engagement with them in the process of developing the JWPs. This is to also ensure good quality assurance for the Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review (QCPR). In 2022, Albania scored the highest regionally in terms of quality assurance with a score of 76.4% for the QCPR of GEM 2 and 3.
The training gathered 33 participants, including members of the Gender Thematic and Results Group and JWP output co-chairs. The post-training questionnaire showed that participants expressed that the most useful part was practicing coding the sub-outputs with the GEM and that overall, the participants acquired an increased understanding in the accuracy of the GEM and HR markers. Around 77% of participants expressed they are confident or very confident in their capacity to apply the markers to sub-outputs correctly, 89% of participants said the training fully or mostly met their expectations and 80% rated the delivery as good, very good or excellent. Elise Dietrichson (UN Inter-agency Coordination Analyst) who led the training on the GEM, expressed she was impressed with the level of existing knowledge in the Albania country team about the markers. She emphasized that the UNCT GEM is not only about a technical scoring exercise, but it should also be a “conversation starter” about the UNCT contribution to gender equality.

Title: The Secretary General message on World Mental Health Day
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
10 October 2023
“Mental health is a universal human right”
Mental health is vital to humanity, allowing us to lead fulfilling lives and contribute fully to our communities.
Yet one in eight people around the world lives with a mental health condition, with women and young people being disproportionately impacted. Three in four people affected receive inadequate treatment – or no care at all. And many face stigma and discrimination.
Mental health is not a privilege but a fundamental human right – and must be part of universal health coverage. Governments must provide care that promotes people’s recovery and upholds their rights. This includes strengthening community-based support and integrating psychological help into broader health and social care.
We must also tackle abuses and break down the barriers that prevent people from seeking support. And we must address root causes – poverty, inequality, violence, discrimination – and create more compassionate and resilient societies.
On World Mental Health Day and every day, let us reaffirm and uphold mental health as a universal human right, and together, build a healthier world where everyone can thrive.

15 September 2023
Democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights are bedrocks of resilient, inclusive, and peaceful societies.
They underwrite freedom, advance sustainable development, and protect the dignity and rights of every person.
On the International Day of Democracy, we celebrate its promise to societies – and recognize the many threats it faces at this time of tension and turmoil.
The walls are closing in on civic spaces.
Mis- and disinformation is poisoning public discourse, polarizing communities, and eroding trust in institutions.
This year’s theme – “Empowering the Next Generation” – focuses on the essential role of children and young people in safeguarding democracy today and in the future.
It is not enough to listen to children and young people.
We must support them with massive investments in education, skills-building, and lifelong learning.
We must protect human rights and advance gender equality.
And we must expand the meaningful participation of young people in decision-making processes at every level.
On this important day, let us join hands across generations and work as one to build a more just world for all.

Title: UNIDO Partnering with Slovenia to Strengthen the Wood Manufacturing Industry in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
15 August 2023
The number of furniture and wood processing companies in Albania has, for the first time in 2020, surpassed 1,000, employing more than 10,000 people.
Wood and other forest products are renewable and highly versatile natural resources that can contribute to climate change mitigation and contribute to a wide range of labour-intensive processing industries.
In Albania, the wood and furniture industry is one of the fastest  growing industries. Government data reports a 19% increase in  exports of furniture from 2015 to 2020 for a total of $62 million in 2020. The number of furniture and wood processing companies in Albania has, for the first time in 2020, surpassed 1,000, employing more than 10,000 people. This number is estimated to be up to three times likely higher due to the informality of the sector.
However, to maintain and expand growth key priorities must be  addressed to strengthen the skilled labour force, update industry- specific legislation, reduce barriers to export, expand national technical and vocational sector specific training capacities, and  digitalize processing activities.
With the support of the Government of Slovenia, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is partnering with the Wood Industry Cluster Slovenia (Zavod Lesarski Grozd) to pilot an initiative to improve the economic competitiveness of Albania’s wood manufacturing sector through enhanced technical skills to practitioners and improved public-private dialogue. The project, Fostering sustainable development in the Albanian wood sector through improved manufacturing capacities and skills training, started in early 2023. The project contributes to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy National Forest Strategy and National Plan for European Union integration.
UNIDO, the specialized agency of the United Nations with a unique mandate to promote and accelerate sustainable industrial development, aims to raise the level of value addition and to upgrade the wood value chain in developing countries in close engagement with the private sector.
UNIDO’s wood programme began in 1967 when efforts were made to show developing countries how to manufacture or process wooden products for export instead of simply exporting raw timber. Very soon, UNIDO had built up an extensive bibliography of manuals, experts’ reports and research papers on different aspects of  wood processing. It also published lectures given at seminars on the wood industry.
UNIDO’s support for the wood industry focuses on technology transfer and capacity building in strong cooperation with local wood industry associations/institutions and respective governmental departments with the main focus on the secondary wood processing industry. Any proposed solutions should contribute to employment creation through expanding labour-intensive secondary  processing industries, raise performance and productivity of the secondary processing sector, ensure raw materials are derived from environmentally sound resources (certified forests, production forests under sustainable management) and support programmes to
minimize and utilize production waste.
Examples of UNIDO recent projects in the wood industry in South Africa focus on providing sustainable forestry skills and  supporting wood processing enterprises with technology, equipment, and training to enhance their business practices. Projects in Lebanon focused on how to shift enterprises which have a more artisan and craft background to adopt industrial processes and international standards through new technologies (i.e. computer numerical control (CNC) machines), while at the same time promoting innovation.
The current pilot initiative in Albania will contribute to a further understanding of the strengths and gaps in wood value chain, and develop cooperation and knowledge sharing between Slovenia and Albania wood industry clusters while building technical vocational training capacity for the wood industry in Albania.

27 June 2023
A high-level dialogue of on the important issue of Financing Sustainable Development in Albania
UN Albania convened today a high-level dialogue of on the issue of Financing Sustainable Development in Albania. This event marked the culmination of a series of dialogues and interventions conducted under a broader multi-partner initiative, aimed at comprehensively addressing the diverse aspects of financing for sustainable development in the country. Today’s event gathered key programme partners from the Government line ministries parliament, UN Agencies, representatives of local and international finance institutions and other speakers and experts in the field.
Building Institutional Capacities and Viable Solutions: This UN Joint Programme has worked closely with national partners to strengthen institutional capacities and identify viable solutions for increasing SDG-related spending in Albania. Through a range of initiatives, the programme has generated valuable insights and lessons that can accelerate progress towards sustainable development targets.
Reflecting on Progress and Emerging Trends: The 'Financing Sustainable Development in Albania' event provided an excellent opportunity to reflect on the progress achieved thus far and engage in discussions on emerging trends in financing sustainable development. Speakers and experts shared their invaluable insights, fostering a dynamic dialogue among participants.
Milestones and Emerging Opportunities: The event featured panel discussions that covered key topics related to financing sustainable development. The first panel highlighted the milestones achieved by Albania in increasing financing for sustainable development, exploring the role of public budgets and other sources of financing in advancing SDGs. The second panel focused on emerging opportunities to finance sustainable development and discussed forward-looking strategies to involve national and international partners.
Importance of Cooperation and Achievements:
In her remarks at the event, the UN Resident Coordinator Fiona McCluney underlined how important is cooperation across financial players if we are to keep our SDG pledges and praised the achievements of the programme in this regard:
‘In Albania, just like in other countries with a similar income level, financing for SDGs has been mainly driven by public spending. However, sustainable development requires an engagement of other actors in the financing landscape, domestic and international. Through this programme UN assisted Albania in providing an analytical basis (INFF) to develop feasible solutions and identifying fiscal space to increase SDG-related spending.
Moving forward, there are some exciting opportunities associated with improved public expenditure oversight, by Parliament, and through enabling framework for private sector and  Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG).  Looking forward seeing the work move forward – she said.
This dialogue offered an opportunity to reflect on the progress made thus far and share the valuable lessons that could be leveraged as the country moved forward in its efforts to achieve sustainable development targets.
Chair of the Parliament Subcommittee on SDGs, Anila Denaj acknowledged the progress made by the 'Support to SDG Financing' Joint Programme.
‘By generating valuable knowledge, conducting capacity building activities, actively engaging in policy development, collaborating with Parliament, and establishing an Integrated National Financing Framework, the programme significantly contributed to advancing the country's sustainable development goals.’ – she said
The programme was implemented jointly by UNDP, UNICEF, and ILO, in close collaboration with UN Women and UNFPA. It was funded by the UN Joint SDG Fund with global contributions from Denmark, European Union, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Title: FAO-National Dialogue on Sustainable Food Systems of Albania, the roadmap to build sustainable food systems and the way forward
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
21 June 2023
Tirana, Albania, June 21, 2023 – The National Dialogue on Sustainable Food Systems of Albania marked a significant milestone in the country's efforts to build sustainable and resilient food systems. The event, held at the Tirana International Hotel, aimed to discuss the roadmap for transforming Albanian food systems through sustainable agro-tourism and fostering cross-sectoral collaborations among governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. The dialogue was organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the UN Resident Coordinator Office and FAO Albania, as part of the FAO project "SFS-MED - A Multi-Stakeholder Initiative for Sustainable Food Systems in the Mediterranean" funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The opening session began with welcoming remarks from Enio Civici, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, who emphasized the importance of sustainable agritourism as a catalyst for rural development and the revitalization of local economies. “Albania's National Pathway recognizes the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and the involvement of
civil society in the implementation of policies. We would like to hear today the views of stakeholders from decentralized areas to consider into a national policy roadmap for food systems transformation, and to ensure the support from policymakers on needed regulations."
The UN Resident Coordinator in Albania, Fiona McCluney, emphasized the importance of local and national dialogues for the significance of sustainable food systems for the country's development. "Today’s dialogue serves as a critical platform for advancing these objectives in Albania. We gather today with key national stakeholders, the UN Country Team, and key
development partners to discuss how we can collectively transform Albania’s food system. We as decision-makers, consumers, researchers, and agri-food operators, need to make collective efforts towards a food system that is delivering safe and nutritious food to the Albanian population, offering economic opportunities to food producers and agri-business operators, and doing so in respect with the environment, advancing jobs for youth in the green economy," stressed Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator.
The FAO Representative for Albania, Raimund Jehle, encouraged the participants to actively engage, share opinions and innovative ideas, and collaborate on transforming Albania's food system to unlock its full potential. "Through the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, as National Food Systems Convenor, and the leadership of the UN Resident
Coordinator, we hope that this Roadmap will guide the implementation of Albania's National Pathway towards sustainable food systems,” noted Mr. Jehle. “To succeed, the expertise, insights, and collaborative spirit of all the actors we convened today are essential, from municipalities to civil society and UN agencies, from academia to financial institutions, as we strive towards a more sustainable and resilient future for Albania's agriculture and food sector.”
The first session focused on presenting the outcomes of the local dialogues and the draft roadmap for sustainable food systems development in Albania, with a specific emphasis on the agro-tourism sector.

Title: World Refugee Day in Tirana
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 June 2023
Tirana, 20 June 2023- In the heart of Tirana, an extraordinary story of artistic expression unfolds on World Refugee Day – a day which falls each year on 20 June and celebrates the strength and courage of people who have been forced to flee their home country to escape conflict or persecution.
Amidst the vibrant atmosphere of a centrally located park in Tirana, a group of young refugees— with unique backgrounds, languages, cultures, and experiences —come together to create something truly remarkable.
Among these children are those who were born in Albania to parents who fled war, conflict, and persecution, while others joined their families on a journey in search of safety, navigating uncertain and sometimes dangerous paths. Their journey led them to Albania, where they found refuge and a new beginning.
This story of artistic expression begins within the walls of the Refugee and Migrant Services in Albania (RMSA) office, UNHCR's partner. Here, a group of young refugee children embark on an inspiring project in anticipation of World Refugee Day.
Each day, the office is alive with a vibrant blend of languages as the young performers gather. With great passion, they immerse themselves in mastering the intricate steps of Albanian dances, rehearsing songs, and reciting poems in Albanian.
After days of hard work and anticipation, the moment arrives at the Grand Park of Tirana on World Refugee Day.
The young performers take their place on the improvised stage. Their hearts beat with excitement, a mix of nervousness and joy filling the air. Despite the various languages spoken amongst them, the rhythm of the Albanian music becomes their shared language on this stage.
Their performance instantly captivates passersby, drawing them to form a circle around the young artists. The onlookers cannot resist joining in. Applause and enthusiastic participation echo through the crowd as they become immersed in the lively dances and joyously sing along to the well-known tunes.
The infectious enthusiasm of one of the youngest members, a small boy, shines brightly. He has certainly dedicated himself to learning the intricate footwork and expressive arm movements of the Vallet e Rugoves, a traditional Albanian dance.

One of the young refugee performers share her experience, saying, "I was super excited and a bit nervous too. But when I saw everyone clapping and having a great time, I felt so relaxed and happy."
Watching the performance, Toshitsuki Kawauchi, UNHCR Representative in Albania, says, "It was very special. The kids worked hard, and it really showed. They have brought their talents and highlighted our shared humanity within the communities where they have found safety."
The Tirana Municipality, offering a central and vibrant venue for this performance, exemplifies Albania's spirit of inclusion.
Behind the scenes, a staff member from the Refugee and Migrant Services in Albania (RMSA), UNHCR's partner, has been present every day as the group of young refugees rehearsed at the center. Reflecting on the preparations and the performances, she shares, "Being a part of this journey and seeing the children's hard work has been truly inspiring. Their genuine excitement as they share their art is absolutely captivating."
On World Refugee Day, the iconic Tirana Clock Tower shone in brilliant blue, a powerful symbol of solidarity #WithRefugees.

Title: FAO and Agriculture University of Tirana collaborate to Financial Literacy Development Initiative for the agriculture sector
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
19 June 2023
Tirana, Albania, 19 June, 2023 - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) announces the launch of the new initiative aimed at fostering financial literacy development in the agriculture sector, with a particular focus on regions affected by the 2019 earthquake including Tirana, Durres and Lezha. The initiative commenced last week with two training sessions for agriculture extension service specialists in Durres and small-scale farmers in Lezha region.
As part of the project "Earthquake Recovery Support through the UN SDG Acceleration Fund" FAO has worked to address the recovery needs of farmers affected by earthquake, with the financial support from the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Recognizing the significance of financial literacy in empowering government institutions and farming communities to make informed financial decisions and improve their access to finance, FAO has identified financial literacy development as a crucial component of the project.
To enhance the financial capacities of extensionists and farmers, a series of nine training events will be conducted in three regions. The training topics will include farm records maintenance, agri-business registration processes for farms (simple financial statements), farm efficiency indicators, practical examples of farm efficiency calculation, business plans in the context of agriculture, steps of business plan preparation and case studies of farm business plans.
The Agriculture University of Tirana (AUT) distinguished for its excellence in agricultural education, research, and innovation, will organize the trainings sessions for agriculture extension specialists and the farmers. The collaboration between FAO and the University highlights the commitment to provide knowledge in various fields of FAO’s mandate. In this framework, on June 13, 2023, FAO senior economists delivered an open lecture with AUT students on “State of Green Finance in Agri-food and “Climate Risks and their Relevance for Central Banks.”
FAO is optimistic that the Financial Literacy Development Initiative, conducted together with AUT, will empower farming communities and government institutions, enabling them to make informed financial decisions and foster sustainable agricultural practices.

Title: Business #2030 Conference: Leading the way to a sustainable future for Albanian companies
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 May 2023
Tirana, Albania - The United Nations and the Embassy of Sweden in Albania are organizing the Business #2030 Conference. This event will introduce traditional and innovative sustainability practices to Albanian companies in a dynamic setting, forging the path towards a resilient and sustainable future.
As Albanian companies face a myriad of challenges in the coming years, including sustainability, digitalization, higher safety and quality standards, and European Union integration, the Business #2030 Conference will provide them with the necessary tools and insights to confront these issues head-on.
“Everyone must be engaged to create a sustainable future! With less than a decade remaining until the global Sustainable Development Goals are to be fulfilled, the work of businesses to become more sustainable is more important than ever. Albania and Albanian businesses are part of Europe and European value chains, and we want to strengthen their sustainable development. During the conference you will hear about and be inspired by Swedish sustainable businesses and their sustainable production, from small scale to large scale companies. We want to support Albanian companies in the EU accession process by reaching EU standards and contribute to a smooth and fair transition towards a climate-neutral economy which improves the quality of life, create better conditions for democratic and inclusive development and which leaves no one behind.” - said Elsa Håstad, Swedish Ambassador in Albania.
Speaking about the context in which the conference is held, the UN Resident Coordinator in Albania, Fiona McCluney said:
“The world now realizes that carbon emissions are not slowing, we may not be able to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degree centigrade. As temperature rises go beyond, we will see crop yields suffer, widespread species loss and an estimated 40 percent of the global population will be exposed to extreme temperatures. We will also reach tipping points, break up of Greenland ice sheet, change in convection currents in north Atlantic, leading to more extreme weather and big temperature changes. The stakes grow and constituencies for change widen. Not only from global agreements – such as Paris – or regulations but also from investors, investments funds who want to help build ‘green businesses’ in the private sector itself and from civil society and especially young people, those who will be most affected. Business #2030 Conference has been designed, through joint UN work, (including UNDP, UNIDO, ILO and FAO) and with a special link to Swedish advocacy, business and technology, to listen to and network with experts in business sustainability, to advance the Sustainable Development Goals and to start to lay a foundation for a resilient future for all.”
The conference will showcase an array of speakers, renowned for their expertise and contributions in their respective fields, including representatives from well-known Swedish companies and business leaders. Notably, the conference will host the famous sustainable fashion designer, Louise Xin, who will share her expertise and insights on sustainable practices within the fashion industry.
Attendees will have the opportunity to learn from these industry experts and engage in thought-provoking discussions. The conference will focus on a variety of crucial topics that set the foundation for a more resilient future for Albanian businesses. Themes to be discussed include:
This session will explore the critical interplay between sustainable practices, balancing business costs and benefits, and setting the foundation for a more resilient future for Albanian businesses. Key topics include business sustainability, cost analysis, resilience, EU standards, and sustainability in key sectors such as the textile/footwear and agro-processing industries.
This session will highlight the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in guiding businesses towards sustainable practices. Key topics include CSR as a driver of profitability, social development goals, competitive advantage, business climate, responsible investments, and corporate values.
This panel session will explore the opportunities and challenges of implementing sustainable practices in the Albanian business world, with a focus on the circular economy. Key topics include sustainable business practices, efficient use of resources, ethics, and avoiding greenwashing.
This session will mark the official launch of the SDG Pioneers Award in Albania. The award recognizes individuals and companies making significant contributions to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This session will explore how innovation and the digital revolution will impact and shape business sustainability in Albania in the next few years. Participants will have the chance to hear from local and international companies, civil society, and young Albanian entrepreneurs who have achieved success in sustainable and innovative products.
In addition to these insightful sessions, the conference will provide collaborative opportunities and insights from Swedish businesses that are leaders in sustainability practices. Participants will engage in dynamic and candid conversations about conducting business in a sustainable way in Albania.

Title: FAO - Advancing sustainable agriculture, Albania's commitment to sustainable use of plant protection products
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
17 May 2023
May 17, 2023, Tirana, Albania - FAO Albania, supported the finalization of the Albanian Action Plan on the sustainable use of plant protection products for the years 2022-2032. The aim of this plan is to minimize risks to humans, animals, and the environment. The Action Plan was finalized and approved by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) with Order No. 578, dated 2.12.2022. It was published in the Official Gazette No. 168, dated 15 December 2022 (pg 236). Additionally, a draft training plan for the implementation of the Action Plan has been prepared.
In collaboration with MARD, FAO conducted local consultations with key stakeholders and facilitated a five-day study tour to Croatia. The tour included visits to the Croatian Ministry of Agriculture, Agency for Agriculture and Food, State Inspectorate, Faculty of Agrobiotechnical Sciences Osijek, and the Teaching Institute for Public Health. The purpose of the tour was to observe the practical functioning of the system and transfer Croatia&#39;s experience in implementing the EU directive on the sustainable use of pesticides.
"Plant protection products (PPPs) are crucial for ensuring food production and food security, considering that plants provide around 80% of the food consumed by humans. However, despite their advantages, particularly in agriculture, the use of PPPs may also have negative consequences for plant and human/animal health (residue levels) as well as the environment" said Agim Pepkolaj, National Project Manager of the Food and Agriculture Organization.
Arian Jaupllari, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, commended the partnership with FAO and emphasized the importance of implementing the Action Plan in collaboration with partners. This implementation will help minimize risks to human health and the environment associated with pesticide use, based on the objectives, actions, measures, and indicators set in the Action Plan.
The project's final workshop brought together key actors involved in PPP regulation and monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan. During the workshop, government representatives from MARD, National Veterinary and Plant Protection Authority, Institute of Food Safety and Veterinary, National Food Authority, Ministry of Tourism and Environment, and Ministry of Health presented their roles and responsibilities for implementing the Action Plan. Furthermore, representatives from donors (GIZ, EUDelegation, and CIHEAM Bari) highlighted their support for the sustainable use of pesticides and discussed possible additional support to the Albanian government in achieving the targets set in the Action Plan.
Another important event organized by FAO, in collaboration with the Agriculture University of Tirana, took place on May 18, 2023. Approximately 50 participants; students, and professors from the Agriculture Faculty, attended the lecture on international cooperation in preventing the spread of plant pests between countries, delivered by Dr. Piotr Wlodarczyk, Agricultural Officer at the FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia.

Title: Promoting women’s leadership and participation in the local elections is key for Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
02 May 2023
The local government elections on 14 May are an important opportunity to strengthen local democracy in Albania, and to consolidate past achievements in promoting women leadership in decision-making. Albania has made remarkable progress in promoting women’s political participation.
According to the 2023 “Women in Politics” global map developed by UN Women and Inter Parliamentary Union, the country ranks 1st for share of women cabinet ministers, and 42nd for percentage of women in Parliament, representing an improvement of 12 positions from 2021 when Albania was ranked 54th globally[1]. However, at the local level, women’s representation is still lower compared to men’s: 44% of local councils' seats were won by women during the 2019 local election and in only 8 of the 61 municipalities (13%) women were elected as mayors, which is even lower than EU average.[2]
 
Ahead of the start of the campaign, the United Nations in Albania reached out to political party leaders, advocating for women’s full and meaningful participation in local elections, and presenting a set of recommendations in three key areas.

First, continue to promote women’s representation at local level: the UN called for political parties to rigorously uphold the 50% gender quotas for the candidates lists for councilors as set forth by the Electoral Code, as well as the active participation of all women and girls in elections both as voters and as candidates, including women and girls with disabilities, Roma and Egyptian women, young women and rural women and girls. The UN specifically called for increasing the number of women candidates for mayoral positions. However, only 15 of 144 mayoral candidates (10.4%) are women[3], which is even lower compared to the proportion of women candidates in the 2019 local elections[4].

Second, address gender bias and harassment against women candidates: political parties participating in the electoral contest should actively collaborate with media outlets and the Audiovisual Media Authority, to ensure adequate coverage of women candidates, and to refrain from the use of derogatory language, gender stereotypes and other types of gender-based violence. A media monitoring report carried out by UN  Women during the 2021 national elections in Albania, showed that traditional and social media consistently undermined women candidates. In addition, a study conducted by UNDP confirmed that women politicians, compared to men, are more likely to experience violence. Political parties should take measures to effectively prevent and counter harassment and violence against women in elections, including by amending legislation to address violence against women candidates, voters and elected officials. Women and girls’ free votes should also be safeguarded, through countering family voting, coercion and intimidation of women voters.
 
Third, consolidate gender equality results at the local level: the 14 May elections provide a unique opportunity to put equal opportunities and participation at the centre of the local political agenda for sustainable development. This includes investing in girls’ education and women’s economic empowerment, as well as strengthening financial and social services such as early childhood development and access to kindergartens. Services should become available to all women and girls, including those most marginalized. Elected leaders should also continue to prioritize the effective functioning and resourcing of local referral mechanisms for coordinated response to domestic violence, as a key instrument to sustain protection and reintegration of women and girls survivors and at risk of violence.
Candidates for local councils and mayoral positions should draw on the European Charter for Equality between women and men in local life, to inform their political agendas and propositions. If elected, they can commit to sign the Charter within the first year of their mandate, and to align the action plans of the Municipality to its provisions. Eighteen municipalities in Albania have already signed the European Charter.
Promoting women’s participation will help Albania make further progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Women and men alike must not accept the role of women as passive spectators. They should work together to create an environment of equal opportunities. By including women in decision-making, we are actively contributing to create a more equal society for all.

[2]According to UN Women, in Europe in 2019, the share of women among municipal mayors was 15%, twice lower than the share of women amongst councilors (30%). See page 17 in this publication: https://www.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/Womens-representation-in-local-government-en.pdf

Title: UNDP and UNFPA sign new partnership with Department of Journalism and Communication to Combat Divisive Narratives in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
19 April 2023
Tirana, Albania, April 11, 2023 - The UNDP, UNFPA, and Tirana University's Faculty of History and Philology have signed a cooperation agreement aimed at combatting divisive narratives in Albania. This partnership is part of the United Nations regional initiative 'Youth 4 Inclusion, Equality & Trust,' which seeks to address issues of hate speech, divisive narratives, toxic masculinities, mistrust, and ethnic or religious tensions in the Western Balkans.
The goal of this partnership is to identify ethnic stereotypes in traditional and social media, increase the knowledge and capacities of 600 students, 40 young journalists, and the public on the use of constructive narratives by avoiding ethnic stereotypes. This initiative will analyze media content from 12 traditional (online and audio-visual) and social media for the period between March to August 2023 regarding the use of ethnic stereotypes, develop tools and methodology for the deconstruction of negative ethnic stereotypes, and raise awareness and capacities of 600 students and 40 young journalists on the use of constructive narratives in traditional and social media.
The methodological approach of this initiative includes media monitoring, production of manuals and dictionaries to deconstruct negative stereotypes, video production and broadcasting. Traditional and social media will be subjects of monitoring and awareness raising, while young journalists and students will act as the agents of change.
Monica Merino, UNDP Representative in Albania, emphasizes: “With the rise of divisive narratives and rhetoric in Albania, this partnership is crucial in promoting constructive and respectful public discourse within and across communities. WE are happy of this partnership with the Journalism and Communication Department at the Faculty of History and Philology. By empowering students of journalism to engage in constructive narratives, we can strengthen intercultural dialogue, inclusion, gender equality, and create mutual understanding and trust. This collaboration will help promote a more constructive and respectful public discourse within and across communities, which is essential in promoting peace, stability, and progress."
The rise of divisive narratives and rhetoric has highlighted the need for more constructive, fact-based narratives and respectful public discourse within and across communities. Divisive narratives have the potential to aggravate regional dynamics, mistrust, and grievances. The degree of internet and cell phone penetration in the region, combined with COVID-19 social restrictions, offers massive platforms for narratives to propagate.
UNFPA Head of Office, Dr. Manuela Bello stated that: “For UNFPA partnering with young journalists is especially important to tackle divisive narratives and hate speech among groups of diverse social backgrounds and sexual orientations, and key young populations. In addition, we aim to strengthen the engagement of young people who recognize the crucial influence of traditional gender norms across identity and community lines to promote constructive narratives and combat hate speech and patriarchal gender norms, in order to increase dialogue and mutual understanding among these groups and promote gender equality.”
This partnership between UNDP, UNFPA, and Tirana University's Faculty of History and Philology is a crucial step in promoting constructive and respectful public discourse within and across communities in Albania. It aims to empower young people to engage in constructive narratives, strengthen intercultural dialogue, inclusion, gender equality, and create mutual understanding and trust in the Western Balkans.

Title: UNDP - Three Urban Search and Rescue containers are handed over to three earthquake-affected municipalities.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
04 April 2023
The Albanian Fire and Rescue Service (AFRS) achieves a significant milestone with the handover of three Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) containers to the municipalities of Durrës, Lezhë, and Fier.
The handover is part of the project "Strengthening the Capacities of the Albanian Fire and Rescue Service," which aims to enhance the capacity and ability of the firefighters to respond effectively to natural and manmade disasters.
The USAR containers are equipped with the latest and highest quality tools and equipment's for search-and-rescue operations during earthquakes, such as hydraulic rescue tools, concrete cutters, acoustic and thermal imaging cameras, and other devices necessary for rescue operations.
The containers are organized in accordance with international standards, ensuring that all equipment is stored safely and in a ready-to-use state.
The Government of Poland provided the funding for this project which is implemented by UNDP after the devastating earthquake of November 2019.
The Albanian government has been committed to improving the country's disaster response capacity ever since, and this handover of the USAR containers is a significant step towards achieving that goal.
The handover was followed by a one-day training programme for the firefighters of the respective municipalities to ensure that they are well-equipped to use and maintain the equipment correctly.
The availability of these modern tools and equipment’s will significantly improve the logistical and operational capacities of the firefighters in response to natural and manmade disasters, making a tangible difference in the lives of the people of Durrës, Lezhë, and Fier.
The handover of the USAR containers represents a significant achievement for the Albanian Fire and Rescue Service, and the impact of this project will be felt for many years to come.

Title: UNICEF - Public Statement by Eva Kadilli, Director of Supply Division
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
23 March 2023
Albania’s 1st Health Congress brought together policymakers, health experts, healthcare professionals, service users, and other key stakeholders to share experiences and engage in dialogue regarding the challenges of health systems. The congress helped to provide a medium for stakeholders to reflect, learn and adapt best international practices with the purpose of providing better care, increasing the quality of services, and being up to date with the latest innovation. Among the special guests invited was Eva Kadilli, Director of UNICEF, Supply Division.
Read the statement below:
"Let me also express my gratitude to Prime Minister Rama and Minister Manastirliu for their leadership and for convening this important and forward-looking forum. I am pleased to see such a comprehensive agenda, which is illustrating the strides that Albania is making to provide affordable, quality, and timely health services to all. UNICEF applauds this commitment and joins WHO and other partners in supporting the Government of Albania in these efforts. At the heart of this agenda is primary healthcare.
Decades of evidence demonstrate that primary healthcare is the best platform for responding to evolving health needs, demographics, environmental challenges, outbreaks and emergencies. Among the areas where a strong system is perhaps the most essential is public health emergencies—as the COVID-19 experience demonstrated. At the global level, we saw how investments made before and during the pandemic – such as cold chain infrastructure – supported the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. As we move beyond the pandemic response, investments in strengthening resilient systems must continue.
UNICEF is a strong advocate for primary healthcare, and in the European region, we are supporting efforts ranging from defining packages of services—to costing and financing—to digital tools to strengthen health information systems. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we supported Albania’s response through the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and related supplies, as well as training for infection prevention and control measures. In addition, our joint work on community engagement and social listening has helped us understand the barriers to immunization uptake. UNICEF has been supporting the government of Albania to procure other quality-assured supplies at affordable prices, such as PCV vaccines to prevent pneumococcal disease, as well as anti-retroviral drugs and tuberculosis medicines, among other life-saving commodities.
At the core of the primary healthcare agenda, is equitable access—including reaching the most vulnerable and marginalized. Children with disabilities are just one example. Assistive Technology, such as pediatric hearing aids, can transform a child’s life. And UNICEF is supporting governments to expand access to Assistive Technology products via primary healthcare platforms. Adolescent mental health is another critical area of focus, as the pandemic took a very heavy toll on this age group. Together with WHO through our Joint Programme on Mental Health, UNICEF is working with the Albania Ministry of Health to reach adolescents with services to support their mental health and psychosocial well-being.
I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the government for introducing the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine last year, and committing to protecting adolescent girls against cervical cancer over the course of their lifetimes – which is a leading cause of mortality among women in Albania, according to WHO. Beyond the prevention of non-communicable diseases, access to treatment is also critical. UNICEF is working with WHO and experts at the St Jude Research Hospital to expand access to childhood cancer medicines. The program is being piloted in 6 countries in different regions, and we hope to expand to other countries in the near future. For all treatments and all medicines, ensuring patient safety is of absolute importance. Addressing substandard or falsified products is essential in the fight against drug-resistant infections. Barcoding technology can help verify the authenticity of health products, and looking forward, barcoding will be a requirement for all medical products procured by UNICEF.
Strengthening healthcare systems and ensuring their resiliency – while also reaching the most vulnerable — are two sides of the same coin. This can only be achieved by working together across government and partners. We must leverage our respective strengths and seek innovative and sustainable solutions. This must also include the private sector, and we call upon these leaders for local solutions to help advance this agenda.
In conclusion, I extend my gratitude, on behalf of UNICEF, for the opportunity to take part in this event. UNICEF is committed to supporting the Ministry of Health, together with all of you – and all partners, to build a more resilient and healthy future for children."

Title: UNDP - Sustainable Packaging: an opportunity for the development of Albanian companies
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
23 March 2023
In partnership with the Swedish International Development Agency, UNDP works to empower private sector entities in Albania to incorporate the Sustainable Development Goals into their operational models.
By now, we have become accustomed to hearing about sustainable packaging, a promising sector at the forefront of environmental protection, innovation, and technological advancements. However, what may be overlooked is its enormous impact on the food industry. Sustainable packaging can be a valuable ally in preventing and managing food waste, enhancing food safety, and enabling the tracking and labeling of food products. These characteristics make it a powerful force in enhancing the sustainability of agro-processing businesses in Albania.
At the high-level event "Business Culture and Sustainability in Sweden: Focus on Sustainable Packaging," held on September 14, 2022, it was evident that some companies are making progress towards sustainable packaging. Albanian water company Lajthiza, for instance, shared their latest efforts in improving the sustainability of their transportation and packaging. Through partnerships with Swedish companies Volvo and TetraLaval, they are investing in enhancing their sustainability. However, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), financial challenges remain significant compared to larger companies.
Despite making up a great part of the economy and being among the most sustainable companies, micro and small businesses often lack the resources to seize sustainable investments and to expand while decreasing their ecological footprint. At the same time, these businesses are also the most vulnerable to shocks, which makes it critical to support them if a just green transition for Albania’s private sector is our objective.
Another side of the coin is, of course, recycling. Due to the delayed development of a national legal framework for integrated waste management, Albanian producers are not incentivized to decrease waste at the source. In addition, municipalities often lack the organisational capacity to ensure recycled waste collection and companies deem current government incentives and subsidies not up to the task. Albania’s future access to the EU market and the preparation to the higher competition that Albanian companies will encounter provide strong incentives both for the private and public sector to increase the pace of their work towards sustainability.
By shedding light on and providing a solution to some of these challenges, sustainable packaging can give a boost to the Albanian food industry and become an ally of local companies in embracing sustainable development. Since businesses of different sizes will encounter diverse challenges, government as well as international development programmes support will be crucial to ensure their green transition and development.
Through the project ‘Business Partnerships & Solutions for SDGs’, funded by the Government of Sweden, through the Swedish International Development Agency, UNDP is engaging Albanian companies in their sustainability journey and creating opportunities for knowledge exchange with Swedish counterparts, considered global pioneers in the integration of sustainable business practices.
UNDP aspires that this project's activities serve as crucial steps towards raising awareness, improving sustainability, and enhancing the competitiveness of Albanian companies. By supporting them in achieving their next milestones, this project aims to catalyse positive change and drive progress.

Title: Secretary-General's video message for press conference to launch the Synthesis Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 March 2023
#ActNow


Watch the video here.
Dear friends,
Humanity is on thin ice – and that ice is melting fast.
As today’s report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) details, humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years.
The rate of temperature rise in the last half century is the highest in 2,000 years.
Concentrations of carbon dioxide are at their highest in at least two million years.
The climate time-bomb is ticking.
But today’s IPCC report is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb.
It is a survival guide for humanity.
As it shows, the 1.5-degree limit is achievable.
But it will take a quantum leap in climate action.
This report is a clarion call to massively fast-track climate efforts by every country and every sector and on every timeframe.
In short, our world needs climate action on all fronts -- everything, everywhere, all at once.
I have proposed to the G20 a Climate Solidarity Pact – in which all big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions, and wealthier countries mobilize financial and technical resources to support emerging economies in a common effort to keep 1.5 degrees alive.
Today, I am presenting a plan to super-charge efforts to achieve this Climate Solidarity Pact through an all-hands-on-deck Acceleration Agenda.
It starts with parties immediately hitting the fast-forward button on their net zero deadlines to get to global net zero by 2050 – in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.
 
Specifically, leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect.
 
This can be done.  Some have already set a target as early as 2035.
Leaders in emerging economies must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2050 – again, the limit they should all aim to respect.
A number have already made the 2050 commitment.
This is the moment for all G20 members to come together in a joint effort, pooling their resources and scientific capacities as well as their proven and affordable technologies through the public and private sectors to make carbon neutrality a reality by 2050.
Every country must be part of the solution.
Demanding others move first only ensures humanity comes last.
The Acceleration Agenda calls for a number of other actions.
Specifically:
No new coal and the phasing out of coal by 2030 in OECD countries and 2040 in all other countries.
Ending all international public and private funding of coal.
Ensuring net zero electricity generation by 2035 for all developed countries and 2040 for the rest of the world.
Ceasing all licensing or funding of new oil and gas – consistent with the findings of the International Energy Agency.
Stopping any expansion of existing oil and gas reserves.
Shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to a just energy transition.
Establishing a global phase down of existing oil and gas production compatible with the 2050 global net zero target.
I urge all governments to prepare energy transition plans consistent with these actions and ready for investors.
I am also calling on CEOs of all oil and gas companies to be part of the solution.
They should present credible, comprehensive and detailed transition plans in line with the recommendations of my High-Level Expert Group on net zero pledges.
These plans must clearly detail actual emission cuts for 2025 and 2030, and efforts to change business models to phase out fossil fuels and scale up renewable energy.
This acceleration has already started in some sectors, but investors now need crystal clear signals.
And all governments need the assurance that business leaders will help them deliver on extra efforts – but governments must also create an enabling policy and regulatory environment.
Shipping, aviation, steel, cement, aluminum, agriculture – every sector must be aligned with net zero by 2050 with clear plans including interim targets to get there.
At the same time, we need to seize the opportunity to invest in credible innovations that can contribute to reaching our global targets.
We must also speed-up efforts to deliver climate justice to those on the frontlines of many crises – none of them they caused.
We can do this by:
Safeguarding the most vulnerable communities, and scaling up finance and capacities for adaptation and loss and damage.
Promoting reforms to ensure Multilateral Development Banks provide more grants and concessional loans and fully mobilize private finance.
Delivering on the financial commitments made in Copenhagen, Paris and Glasgow.
Replenishing the Green Climate Fund this year and developing a roadmap to double adaptation finance before 2025.
Protecting everyone with early warning systems against natural disasters in four years.
Implementing the new loss and damage fund this year.
The longer we wait on any of these crucial issues, the harder it will become.
In less than nine months, leaders will gather at COP28 for the first global stocktake of the Paris Agreement.
They will also launch the process to prepare the next cycle of national climate plans – or Nationally Determined Contributions -- due in 2025.
These new climate plans must reflect the acceleration we need now, over this decade and the next.
By the end of COP28, I count on all G20 leaders to have committed to ambitious new economy-wide nationally determined contributions encompassing all greenhouse gases and indicating their absolute emissions cuts targets for 2035 and 2040.
The transition must cover the entire economy.
Partial pledges won’t cut it.
I look forward to welcoming “first movers” on the Acceleration Agenda at the Climate Ambition Summit in September in New York.
Once again, I thank the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for showing the fact-based, science-grounded way out of the climate mess.
We have never been better equipped to solve the climate challenge – but we must move into warp speed climate action now.
We don’t have a moment to lose.
Thank you.

Title: UN Women hosts first youth consultation as part of UN’s ‘Youth 4 Inclusion, Equality & Trust’ initiative.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
15 March 2023
More than fifty young people from the region engaged virtually in a constructive dialogue addressing the root causes of gender inequalities and its implication for social cohesion. This was the first regional consultation organized by UN Women as part of UN’s ‘Youth 4 Inclusion, Equality & Trust’ project supported by the UN Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund, contributing to promoting gender equality as a driver for social cohesion and reconciliation in the Region.
Participants in academia and civil society from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo , shared their firsthand experiences as well as their own perspectives on gender equality and social cohesion challenges.
“It’s unfortunate for women or vulnerable groups to remain silent just because they don’t have proper means and mechanisms to speak up for themselves. So, when we try to modernize our societies, we need sustainable mechanisms for these groups to build up confidence and speak up about issues that really matter to them”, highlighted Esmeralda Doku from Albania.
With traditional gender norms still playing an active role in the region, including fueling divisive narratives and deepening persisting gender inequalities and forms of discrimination, UN Women has taken the lead on confronting gender equality dimension to social cohesion challenges. Still young people believe that there is a lot to be done, as they believe that the “patriarchal system they are living in teaches girls to be good girls, to be submissive, to take care of their families; do the house cores etc. and boys are never asked doing that. As Una Milic from Serbia stated, “this form of patriarchal education affects us since we are little until we are adults”.
The youth ideas and perspectives emerging from this initial consultation will contribute to the regional research being conducted to advance the project’s overall goal in educating, empowering, engaging and encouraging young men and women to be a catalyst for social cohesion.
Studies demonstrate that expectations of new generations of young, educated women significantly surpass traditional societal norms. In the UN’s September 2021 youth consultation that polled 450 young people, an overwhelming 96 per cent of respondents indicated that gender equality and rights and opportunities for both women and men is important for good relations between and within communities, institutions and youth.
UN women hopes that youth will be the drivers in gender equality, mutual understanding, constructive narrative and respect for diversity in the Region.

Title: Western Balkan Youth Speak Out for Gender Equality and Social Cohesion
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
13 March 2023
More than fifty young people from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo* , engaged in a virtual dialogue to address the root causes of gender inequalities and their implications for social cohesion. This was the first regional consultation organized by UN Women Albania as part of the UN’s ‘Youth 4 Inclusion, Equality & Trust’ project funded by the UN Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund, aiming to support young men and women from the Western Balkans to promote constructive and fact-based narratives, and contribute to building trust, intercultural dialogue, cultural diversity, gender equality and social cohesion in the region.
Participants were from academia and civil society. Discussions were focused on five topics: Negative legacies of the past; Nationalistic and anti-gender narratives; Social acceptance and social distance; Gender equality for social cohesion and the Covid-19 pandemic.
The youth identified a strong link between the undermining of democratic systems, rising nationalism and social vulnerability. Youth, especially youth from the Western Balkans, was discussed both as a group vulnerable to nationalism and anti-gender equality movements reinforcing gender polarization, but also as a social group countering the anti-gender equality narrative. Participants called on youth to play a greater role in policymaking, advocacy, media literacy, and education on social issues.
The participants recognized the role of family and education in maintaining and reproducing naturalized inequalities in the private sphere. While family is an important means of socialization, the youth emphasized the strong influence of patriarchal values in the nuclear family. As girls grow up, female submission is presented positively; women are expected to internalize submission as a natural trait to be considered “a good, well-educated girl”. One participant pointed out that children must be raised equally.
Many young people in the region are almost "apathetic"; and have little interest in critically engaging with mainstream narratives: “There is a lot of hate speech propaganda in the media, especially on social media channels, that young people are mostly following. So, youth start to believe that the only alternative to the status quo they are living in, is the world portrayed by nationalistic rhetoric, because it is easier to be involved in, and simpler to believe” Harisa Bojčić (BiH).
“Nationalism is manifesting in a way that actually uses traditional gender roles as means of defining national identity and this is strongly linked to what we’ve seen rising in young people, especially young men” Artiola Babuni (Kosovo).
The participants agreed that the #metoo movement in the Western Balkans was a huge success in terms of encouraging women to speak up on issues generally considered taboo:  “When we talk about gender equality in the WB, the gender issues we all face are very similar. Even with different backgrounds and differences in how we grew up, we can all find some middle ground and talk about the issues that we all face. So, it is important to have this understanding, and to have solidarity” Una Milic (Serbia).
The discussions on politics and gender roles highlighted the role of quotas in raising women’s representation in politics. However, women in politics remain underrepresented in terms of effective power, leadership, and decision-making. “Women are often described in politics as “trophies”, showing that “the numbers are achieved”, but what remains unobserved is the aspect related to “how women engage in politics”. Women should be more proactive, negotiate between parties, lead negotiating processes, policy making and parties’ political discourses”. Klajdi Kaziu (Albania).
With traditional gender norms still playing an active role in the region, including fueling divisive narratives and deepening persisting gender inequalities and forms of discrimination, UN Women has taken the lead on confronting gender equality dimension to social cohesion challenges.
The youth ideas and perspectives emerging from this initial consultation will contribute to the regional research being conducted to advance the project’s overall goal to empower, engage and encourage young men and women to drive the achievement of gender equality, mutual understanding, constructive narratives and respect for diversity across the region.

Title: UNFPA - Albania's Health Congress: UNFPA's contributions to address challenges in providing health services towards Universal Health Coverage.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
09 March 2023
For the first time in the last decade, Albania organized the Health Congress. Policymakers, public health institutions representatives, health professionals, and international organizations representatives came together to discuss achievements, gaps and challenges in improving health services in Albania.
UNFPA is one of the main actors and contributors to the improvement of the health sector in the country. During the Health Congress, UNFPA presented the work in collaboration with public health institutions, experts and civil society organizations, aiming to address priorities related to sexual and reproductive health, in particular and public health, in general from a demographic resilience perspective.
The participation and interaction of authorities and participants from various health institutions promoted cooperation to address future challenges for qualitative and comprehensive services, focusing on achieving Universal Health Coverage.
Developing local action plans to address the challenges of the dynamic demographic changes in a world of 8 billion people is one way of UNFPA’s direct work at local level. UNFPA Gender and Population Development Programme Analyst, Elsona Agolli, presented the impact such changes have on older persons and other marginalized groups in the country, and ways and some solutions on how to get prepared and address them. “This Health Congress discussions are well in line with UNFPA’s work and interventions at strategic level, at capacity building level of public health service providers, and at data generation and analysis level. For UNFPA, but also for all participants, part of the congress, raising awareness and information sharing among the population groups to meet the needs for integrated health services for the 65+ age group, aiming to achieve the objective that no one is left behind, remains very important”, said Ms. Agolli.
Youth and sexual and reproductive health are two other key pillars of UNFPA’s engagement in the country through cooperation with public institutions and organizations. For Dorina Toçaj, Sexual & Reproductive Health and Youth Programme Analyst at UNFPA, health and well-being is not only lack of diseases, but it is a complete emotional, physical and psychological fulfillment of the individual. “Our joint work in the following years must be focused on informing and raising awareness to increase young people’s access to public health care services. These days we still face unequal gender norms. Challenge should make us understand and act to make our young people’s potential become fulfilled also through ensuring a healthy state of their sexual and reproductive health and well-being”, said Ms. Toçaj.
For UNFPA these challenges have an impact not only on the well-being of young people but also on the economic development and poverty reduction, so efforts to provide health services for the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups must be strengthened. Work on the ground with young people remains important for UNFPA to address structural barriers that youth face in using and accessing public health services.
UNFPA remains committed to work with these marginalized groups, not only to improve health services, but also to improve access and quality of the services provided to these groups.

Title: UN in Albania advocates for review of the Gender Equality Law
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
08 March 2023
The adoption of the Law on Gender Equality almost 15 years ago represented a key milestone in bringing the national legal framework in line with international standards. Over the years, the gender equality agenda has continued to evolve, including thanks to a strong feminist movement. The UN in Albania has taken the opportunity of International Women Day to reflect on these developments and to advocate for a revision of the Law, which can be particularly helpful in the context of Albania’s accession to the EU.
Through a joint position paper, the UN in Albania wishes to offer an initial contribution to the public conversation on the revision of the Law, which is included as part of the implementation of the existing National Strategy on Gender Equality.

The 2008 Gender Equality Law played a key role in advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women in the country. It introduced gender quotas to increase women's representation in elected positions, required that budgets and policies consider the needs and priorities of both women and men. The Law aimed to eliminate discrimination based on gender across sectors of government action, providing for adequate protection mechanisms.  Thanks to its provisions, other key pieces of legislation were strengthened, such as for example on labour participation, property rights, representation, and other aspects of people’s lives. 

A revised Law on Gender Equality can contribute to accelerate progress over gender equality that is integral to the SDGs, including for example through sustained focus on promoting agency and representation of women from disadvantaged groups, as well as fostering investments in gender capacity and coordination among institutions, both at central and local levels.

Title: Op-ed from the UN Secretary General for the International Women's Day
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
08 March 2023
Around the world, progress on women’s rights is vanishing before our eyes. The latest forecasts estimate that on our current track, it will take another 300 years to reach full gender equality.
Today’s cascading crises, from the war in Ukraine to the climate emergency, affect women and girls first and worst. And as part of the global pushback against democracy, women’s rights over their bodies and autonomy over their lives are being questioned and denied.

Two statistics make our failure very clear:

Every ten minutes, one woman or girl is murdered by a family member or intimate partner.

And one woman dies every two minutes during pregnancy or childbirth. Most of those deaths are entirely preventable.

On International Women’s Day, we must commit to doing better. We need to reverse these horrific trends and stand up for the lives and rights of women and girls, everywhere.

This is one of my core priorities and a central plank of the work of the United Nations around the world.

From South Sudan to Myanmar, we are supporting women and girls in crisis and making sure their voices are heard in peace processes.

The Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, recently visited Afghanistan with a message for the authorities: women and girls have fundamental human rights, and we will never give up fighting for them.
This year, International Women’s Day focuses on closing gender gaps in science, technology, and innovation. Globally, men are 21 percent more likely to be online than women — and over 50 percent more likely in low-income countries.

But even the richest countries lose out because of gender-based stereotypes and historic bias. In the tech industry, men outnumber women two to one. In Artificial Intelligence, it’s five to one.

Big data is the new gold, and the foundation of today’s political and business decisions. But it often ignores gender differences – or turns a blind eye to women altogether.
We should all be alarmed by products and services that bake in gender inequality right from the start, and digitize patriarchy and misogyny.
The Silicon Valleys of this world must not become Death Valleys for women’s rights.
Medical decisions based on data from men’s bodies can not only harm women; it can be deadly.
Discrimination against women in science and technology is the result of centuries of patriarchy, discrimination and damaging stereotypes. Women account for just three percent of Nobel Prize winners in scientific categories since 1901. And women online – including scientists and journalists – are often targeted for sexist hate speech and abuse designed to silence and shame them.
But they will not be silenced. Women and girls everywhere are demanding their rights, and their words reverberate around the world.
We need action on several fronts to make sure women and girls can make their full contribution to the world’s knowledge through science and technology.
We must break down barriers — from discriminatory data to stereotypes that push girls away from studying scientific subjects at an early age.
Decisionmakers of all kinds must broaden women’s participation and leadership in science and technology, through quotas if necessary.
They should be creative, widening the recruitment pipeline and hiring for skills. And they must be persistent. Gender equality will not happen by itself; it has to be prioritized and pursued. This approach is getting results at the United Nations, where we have our own strategy for gender parity among our personnel.
We also need action to create a safe digital environment for women and to hold accountable both the perpetrators of online abuse, and the digital platforms that enable them.
The United Nations is working with governments, civil society, the private sector and others on a Code of Conduct aimed at reducing harm and increasing accountability on digital platforms, while defending freedom of expression.
Women’s rights are not a luxury that can wait until we solve the climate crisis, end poverty and create a better world.
Investing in women and girls is the surest way to uplift all people, communities and countries, and to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Together, let’s work for a more inclusive, just, and prosperous world for women and girls, men and boys, everywhere.

Title: UNOPS/EU4Culture - Artisans between Past and Future: Helping Albanian Women Sell Online
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
08 March 2023
For centuries, marketing and sales at the traditional crafts market of the ancient mountain city of Kruja, were mens’ jobs. Revenues were limited to a short tourist season and highly dependent on the good weather. New technologies were a perfect solution for helping artisans improve their livelihoods and become more resilient for future challenges and shocks, such as pandemics, bad weather conditions or travel restrictions.
EU4Culture implemented by UNOPS in Albania is supporting women artisans in Kruja to develop and enhance their branding and digital marketing skills to go beyond business-as-usual and leverage an untapped potential of the domestic and international online markets.
Through the “Artisans between Past and Future” grants initiative, women artisans took part in 12 training sessions to learn how to use social media and create visually-appealing content in order to market and sell their handicrafts online.

The new digital skills are already helping women artisans to specialize, develop niche products, “hear” their customers and ensure they have business not only during busy summer months.
We asked some of them to share their thoughts with us and here what they told us:
‘’The marketing workshop was very useful for me and it will help me to have an online presence to sell our products” noted  Dallandyshe Tabaku, a 35 year-old traditional carpet maker.
“We have learnt marketing skills for our products, how to advertise them online, adapt our sales to the modern market realities” noted Kumrije Berushi who has been an artisan for more than 30 years.
“I became an artisan when I was 15 years old and I would really like to pass on this craft to all young girls and women while I am still able to work to make sure that traditional craft of carpet-making will not get lost” noted Deshire Maja.

Title: UNDP - Accreditation of Vocational Education and Training Schools in Albania: A Milestone for Quality Education and Employment Opportunities
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
02 March 2023
The accreditation of vocational education and training schools in Albania (VET) represents a significant milestone towards ensuring quality education and improving employment opportunities for young people in the country.
In the context of the  Swiss-funded Skills Development for Employment Programme, UNDP has been working closely with develop a quality assurance framework for VET. This involved the development of an accreditation model, procedures, criteria, and standards, as well as capacity development for the National Agency for VET and Qualifications and external evaluators who are in charge to asses the criteria for accreditation.
As a result, six VET providers successfully completed the accreditation process and received certification, with five public and one private provider receiving the accreditation seal.
A  ceremonial gathering  to celebrate the accreditation of these six providers brought together key stakeholders in the sector, including representatives from the Swiss Development and Cooperation and representatives from VET schools.
Going forward, UNDP, in partnership with the Government of Switzerland, will continue to support Albanian institutions in advancing the VET system reform, addressing skills gaps, promoting lifelong learning, and reducing unemployment. This will ensure that the VET system is capable of meeting the changing demands of the labor market and supporting economic growth in Albania.

Title: UNDP - USAID partners with UNDP to Enhance Resilience of Albanian Communities
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
28 February 2023
Tirana, February 28, 2023: United States Agency for International Development in Albania (USAID/Albania) has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to strengthen the resilience of marginalized communities through a new project: Improving Community Resilience (ICR).
ICR is a three-year project, which will establish a model of support to marginalized communities in Albania affected by exclusion, discrimination, conflict, or abuse.  ICR will enhance the resilience of all people in Albania by ensuring those most underserved receive the support they need.
The project will be implemented in Durrës, Lezhë, and Kurbin.  ICR will support local government bodies to provide integrated social services including access to justice, healthcare, education, and social protection.  Local governments will work as part of a cohesive team in partnership with civil society organizations and pilot a model for integrated social care services, which can be replicated.
Mischere Kawas, Head of USAID/Albania, emphasized the focus of ICR:
“Our priority is to protect the rights and safety of communities most at risk of falling through the cracks: those affected by conflict, discrimination, and abuse. This is at the heart of the Improving Community Resilience project. Through close collaboration with local Albanian institutions, USAID and our partner UNDP will remove barriers to access services and establish an integrated, sustainable support system–so that no one in Albania is left behind.”
The project will also strengthen local prevention and protection mechanisms with a particular focus on women and girls who are impacted by violence.  Additionally, marginalized groups will increase their peer support networks to share best practices and support each other.  In addition, through authentic media engagement by members of these marginalized communities, all citizens of Durrës, Lezhë, and Kurbin will learn about the positive impact of the integrated social services platform in their communities.
Monica Merino, UNDP Resident Representative in Albania, said:
“We are happy for this new partnership with USAID to further the social inclusion, gender equality agenda in Albania. UNDP Albania is committed to working with national and local partners to promote social cohesion and strengthen social protection systems, as well as consolidate institutional mechanisms and integrated social services as per the needs of vulnerable women and men.”
ICR will be implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, local governments, non-public actors, local CSOs, international development partners, and the media.
Over the next three years, ICR will make a significant contribution to the development of inclusive and resilient communities in Albania.
This project was made possible through the generous support of the American people through USAID.

Title: IOM - Rapid Displacement and Needs Assessment on Ukrainian refugees in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
28 February 2023
From 24 February to 31 December 2022, nearly 32,000 Ukrainians entered Albania. About 2,500 displaced Ukrainians who have fled the war, were estimated to be still present at the end of December.
Between 7 November and 31 December 2022, IOM conducted a Rapid Displacement and Needs assessment in Albania interviewing respondents in seven locations: Durres, Saranda, Tirana, Vlora, Kavaja, Vora and Shkodra to gather more in-depth information on the profiles, intentions and needs of Ukrainians present in Albania.
This report presents the findings of a survey administered to 101 Ukrainian refugees and seven Key Informants (KIs) from the Albanian Red Cross, the Ministry of Interior, Caritas, and two Ukrainian nationals residing in Albania, on November-December 2022. Almost 90 per cent of the interviewed were women, half of them in the age group of 30 to 39 years old.
The majority of Ukrainian refugees traveled in groups consisting of household members usually groups of up to three persons, mostly coming from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhzhia.
Although only 40% were still employed at the time of the interview, 80% of them were employed or self-employed before fleeing Ukraine. The level of education among the interviewees was high too, two-thirds declared that they had a Master's degree or PhD. Nonetheless, almost two-thirds of the interviewees stated that they were planning to search for work in Albania.
The rapid displacement and needs assessment used a multi source and multi method approach to obtain qualitative and quantitative data from a wide range of stakeholders, and aimed to provide more in depth information on Ukrainian refugees residing in Albania in terms of profile, intentions and needs to provide additional information to first line responders, national authorities and the donor community, as well as to support a better and tailored specific response to those in need.

Title: UNDP - Albania Strengthens Resilience with Adoption of New National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy and Action Plan
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
27 February 2023
The Albanian Government has taken a major step towards strengthening its civil protection system by adopting the new National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy and Action Plan (2023-2030). These documents, together with the National Risk Assessment, are vital to mitigating, preventing, preparing for, and responding to disaster risks in Albania.
Developed by the National Civil Protection Agency in partnership with the RESEAL project, funded by the governments of Sweden and Portugal, the implementation of these documents will enhance the country's capacity to manage, cope with, and reduce disaster risks. The strategy, which is the first-ever disaster risk reduction document prepared by Albania, is in line with the Sendai framework and EU guidelines and takes into account the impact of climate change on disaster risk reduction, with a particular focus on gender and vulnerable groups.
The DRR strategy, a cross-sectorial document, will be implemented over the next seven years and is supported by a robust action plan that outlines specific measures, including the establishment of early warning systems, strengthening of emergency response and recovery systems, prevention and response to disasters, improving building standards and land use planning, supporting critical needs for DRR infrastructure, and enhancing community participation in disaster risk reduction.
Haki Cako, General Director of the National Agency of Civil Protection, emphasized the importance of these national documents to building a safer and more resilient Albania, a full member of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. "We recognize the devastating impact that disasters can have on our communities, and we are taking proactive steps to reduce risk and protect our citizens."
Petra Burcher, Head of the Swedish Development Cooperation, in Albania said:
"This is an essential part of Sweden’s support to Albania after the earthquake 2019. The now approved National DRR Strategy and its Action Plan is an important milestone to prevent disaster and to continue efforts to strengthen disaster risk management in Albania.”
Monica Merino, UNDP Resident Representative, stressed the significance of the strategy and action plan, stating: "The adoption of the strategy and action plan marks a significant milestone in Albania's efforts to strengthen the national system on disaster risk management and civil protection. It represents a comprehensive and coordinated approach at all levels to disaster risk reduction that will help protect Albanian citizens and communities from the devastating effects of disasters."
The National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy and its Action Plan, the National Risk Assessment Document, and the ongoing preparation of the National Civil Emergency Plan have been developed through a broad consultation process. The adoption of these national DRR strategic and planning documents demonstrates Albania's commitment to improving its mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery ability to disasters. It also serves as an example for other countries in the region grappling with the effects of disasters and climate change.

Title: FAO helps rebuild agriculture and livelihoods in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
21 February 2023
Tirana – A three-year FAO project is providing recovery and reconstruction assistance to smallholder farmers in the Republic of Albania impacted by the 2019 earthquake.  Implemented with the financial support of the governments of the  Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the project “Earthquake Recovery Support through the UN SDG Acceleration Fund,” aims to increase resilience of the agriculture-based livelihoods of the communities hit by the earthquake and to restore agricultural production in the six affected municipalities* in Albania. Since its onset the project has already improved the lives of 108 vulnerable persons living on the edge of poverty in rural areas.
The project has resulted in a close two-year collaboration between FAO, the national and local governments and individual smallholder farmers. Thirty-six farmers were selected to receive grants to restore their agriculture production and enhance their farms’ productivity with ninety-five percent of the support allocated to the livestock sector, most-affected by the earthquake. They received cash transfers to purchase livestock, agricultural equipment, and machinery. FAO delivered training to farmers teaching them specific skills to better manage and strengthen their farms and agribusiness.
As part of the project results FAO provided training to financial institutions and businesses on agroprocessing agreements and to municipalities and extension agencies on disaster-risk reduction in agriculture. Through its extension services, FAO worked with farmers to negotiate access to credit and micro-financing and to reach agreement with their financial institutions on funding to restore lost production capacities.
“FAO strives to build back better and increase the resiliency of farmers to be able to cope with external shocks. These farmers suffered from the pandemic, from the earthquake, and now they must cope with the inflation,” said FAO project manager Agim Pepkolaj.
This year, in addition to continuing to provide grants, the project expects to distribute animal feed provisions to 30 livestock farmers, including 17 tonnes of crushed corn, 40 tonnes of hay and 43 tonnes of alfalfa. Along with distribution, FAO will continue to boost knowledge of best animal feeding practices.
The project not only helps Albanian farmers recover from the damage of the earthquake but to build back better with enhanced farm viability, productivity, and sustainability of agriculture.

Title: UNDP - EU4Schools Builds back better and helps preserve cultural heritage for future generation
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
18 February 2023
"Excavation Uncovers important Ancient Structures and Artefacts, Shedding New Light on Durrës' Pre-Roman and Roman History".
As the first rays of sunlight illuminated Durrës, archaeologist Iris Pojani stood in awe at the construction site of the "Eftali Koçi" 9-year school. Excitement filled her as she gazed upon the site, where recent demolition efforts brought to light several significant archaeological finds. These discoveries had prompted a full-scale excavation, and Iris was eager to uncover the secrets buried beneath the soil.
As a result of the historic finds, the National Council of Cultural Heritage mandated that any uncovered structures must be protected in their original state. This presented a challenge for the construction of the "Eftali Koçi" 9-year school, as it required the relocation of the building and a rethinking of its design. Adherence to Legal Protocols helped ensure the Preservation of Cultural Heritage and Mitigated Threats to Archaeological Site during Planning.
As she supervised the rescue excavation, the team of archaeologists was thrilled to be part of such a unique project. She marvelled at the ancient ruins being uncovered, feeling the rich history of the once-thriving city.
During her tour, Iris made a remarkable discovery: a piece of a map intricately carved with details of the city's past. She quickly realized its significance as it showed the division of the city into different spaces such as urban, funerary, and sacred areas, and provided valuable information about the city's early history and extent of its surrounding agricultural lands.

Over the next few months, Iris and the team worked tirelessly to uncover more secrets of the city and unearthing Durrës' Hidden Treasures". She discovered urban and extra-urban sanctuaries, highlighting the city's religious significance, as well as a complex system of roads and buildings, showcasing its impressive urban planning. Her findings added valuable knowledge to the city's history and emphasized the importance of preserving cultural heritage.
Iris was committed to conducting the excavation with precision and care. All artifacts were meticulously documented and preserved to the highest standards.
After presenting the findings, the Ministry of Culture decided to preserve the complete Archaic Hellenistic-era fortification wall and tower and relocate the school's foundation to an unoccupied area of the site. To allow visitors to admire the discoveries without disrupting the students' learning environment, a separate entrance was designed specifically for visiting purposes.
"Iris' Joy Unfolded as EU4Schools Project Interweaved Archaeological Finds into City's Story, Building an Educational Museum within School Grounds".
Other than the wall structures many artefacts were collected on the site during the archaeological excavation. The specialists are now working trying to process the finds. Various ceramic wares like amphoras (large containers) and large amounts of lids are selected. Black figure and red figure vases dated to the 5th century are found together with lamps, various wares and shapes.
Terracotta figurines of human and animal subjects are well attested.
In November of 2022, the excavation at the new site, prior to the rebuilding of the "Eftali Koçi" 9-year school. Now the excavation process was completed, and the reconstruction of the school is set to proceed promptly upon its completion, in accordance with the law.
The discoveries made during the excavation have shed new light on the ancient society that once lived in the area, providing valuable insight into their cultural and economic practices. The dedicated archaeological team continues to work tirelessly to process the finds and explain the unknown story of the site.
During a recent visit to the excavation site, UNDP Resident Representative Monica Merino expressed her pride in the project, stating: “The EU4Schools project is more than just the construction of a school. It represents a commitment to preserving and sharing Durrës' rich cultural heritage for future generations to appreciate and enjoy. We are proud to know that this educational facility not only provides better opportunities for children, teachers, and the community, but also protects the city's cultural heritage."
The school will offer its students a unique and immersive learning experience, surrounded by the rich history of their city.
As Iris leaves the site, she knows that the school will serve as a symbol of Durrës' resilience and as a testament to the importance of preserving cultural heritage for future generations to enjoy and learn from.

****EU4Schools Programme is the biggest EU investment in education in Albania. With an amount of Euro 75 Million, 63 education institutions are being reconstructed or repaired benefitting around 25,000 pupils, children, teachers. EU4School Programme is implemented by UNDP in Albania.

Title: UNIDO - Working towards greater market access for Albanian products
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
17 February 2023
On 17th of February 2023, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), presented the preliminary findings of the thorough sector assessment which aimed at identifying quality requirements in view of greater market access for two key industrial sectors, namely medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) and fruits and vegetables (F&V). As part of the Global Quality and Standards Programme (GQSP), the stakeholder workshop saw the participation of more than 55 key stakeholders with the presence of Vice Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Mr. Enio Civici, Vice Ambassador of Switzerland in Albania Mr. Patrik Meier as well as other high-level public and private sector representatives from the Albanian quality infrastructure system, the agricultural sector and international development community.
Preliminary findings of the value chain study highlighted that, although the production of Albanian medical and aromatic plants has more than tripled in a decade, many producers fail to comply with standards, operate on outdated facilities and technologies and lack the awareness and knowledge on standards and market requirements overall. Consignments of fruits and vegetables are rejected at the EU border because of contamination stemming from the lack of related national testing capacity to detect said contaminations. While testing laboratories are in place and basic equipment is available, staff is often not well capacitated to perform internationally recognized tests.
Against this background, within the framework of GQSP country project “Strengthening Quality and Standards Compliance Capacity for Selected Value Chains” in Albania will support to enhance the quality compliance capability of both sectors (Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and Fruits & Vegetables) in order to reduce border rejections and boost exports and to improve both quality and productivity in these value chains. UNIDO, through the GQSP, will aim at addressing the identified bottlenecks, which include supporting producers to upgrade their production and meet market requirements, strengthening related testing laboratories, accreditation and standardization capacities as well as raising awareness on the overall importance of quality and standards for trade and export.
The GQSP Programme is funded by Switzerland, through the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), and implemented by UNIDO.

Title: UNFPA roundtable against discrimination in the private business sector within the project "Expanding Choices: Gender Responsive Family Policies for the Private Sector in the Western Balkans and Moldova"
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
14 February 2023
Ensuring a stable balance between life and work remains a multisectoral collective effort that requires a long-term commitment from all interested actors. UNFPA Albania has been working for years to guarantee rights and choices for everyone, including respect for rights at the workplace.
Through the project "Expanding choices: Gender Responsive Family Policies for the Private Sector in the Western Balkans and Moldova" that UNFPA is implementing with the financial support of the Austrian Development Agency, it has been possible to promote the change and approach by private companies operating in Albania that apply gender-responsive family-friendly policies that prevent discrimination at the workplace and support young women, couples, and families.
Based on this objective, UNFPA in cooperation with the Commissioner for Antidiscrimination and the Women's Economic Chamber organized a roundtable: "Knowledge of the law against discrimination by private businesses". Participants included experts in the field and representatives of champion private enterprises operating in Albania that are committed to applying gender-responsible family policies to support their employees and families and want to improve workplaces for their staff.
The Head of UNFPA office in Albania, Dr. Manuela Bello, in her opening remarks emphasized the importance of interventions like the "Expanding choices" project, as they bring together local market companies around important social issues, but also help promote respect for employment, gender and family rights at the workplace.
"This project has so far achieved its main goal, i.e. encourage discussions at all levels for the application of gender-responsive family-friendly policies, not only in the private sector but also in the public sector. All actors involved have shown goodwill and acted positively when it comes to the application and improvement of such policies which benefit commercial activity as well", said Dr. Manuela Bello.
According to Dr. Bello, this project has laid important foundations for further actions and extension to other spheres, like identification of gaps in terms of discrimination of employees. We hope our studies and recommendations will help harmonize family-friendly policies for women and men.
For Mr. Robert Gajda, the Commissioner for Antidiscrimination, “The roundtable is very important towards increasing the knowledge of all actors on the issue, including the institution he leads. In recent years there has been an increasing trend of complaints to the Commissioner from the private sector. "Despite the type of discrimination, it is usually the economically disadvantaged people who become the subject of discrimination. The economic situation is the common denominator that generates discriminatory behaviors toward employees. What we have noticed is that often the entities that have been discriminatory have expressed a lack of knowledge about the rights and obligations towards the implementation of anti-discrimination policies towards employees and, for this reason, human resources play an important role in respecting anti-discrimination policies. Therefore, it is very important for us that this department is professionally and fully capacitated to handle discriminatory situations at the workplace", said Mr. Gajda.
The Women's Economic Chamber was represented by the Head, Mrs. Antonela Hako, who emphasized that "Gender division starts from the time of vocational education, where professions are divided into professions for girls and for boys. Fortunately, in recent years we have seen good practices of application of friendly family policies for employees in the private sector. Although the past challenges and those to be addressed still need a strong and unified voice to be resolved, it seems that important steps are being taken toward improving the situation. For us and many businesses run by women, the most important asset in our ventures are and will remain the employees, for whom we aim to enable a safe work environment free of any discrimination.", said Mrs. Hako.
Studies conducted by UNFPA show that 71% of employees in the private sector are not informed about family-friendly policies, while only 17% of private businesses have internal regulations for protection against discrimination at the workplace.
The project "Expanding Choices: Gender Responsive Family Policies for the Private Sector in the Western Balkans and Moldova" is implemented by UNFPA and funded by the Austrian Development Agency.

10 February 2023
Tirana – On February 9, 2023, IOM Missions in Albania and Montenegro facilitated a joint meeting in Tirana among Albanian and Montenegrin readmission authorities to monitor the implementation of the Readmission Agreement between the two countries.
Respectively headed by Mr. Radovan Popovic, Acting General Director from the Directorate for Administrative, Citizenship and Foreign Affairs of Montenegro and Mrs. Alma Mele, Director of Anti-Trafficking and Migration Policies at the Ministry of Interior of Albania, both delegations exchanged information on readmission statistics for the period 2021-2022 and discussed over ongoing negotiations and protocols as well as those planned in the future.
The Montenegrin authorities were represented with Mr. Dragan Dasic, Director of the Department for Foreigners, Migration and Readmissions, Mr. Dejan Bojic, Senior Inspector in the Department for Foreigners, Visas and Prevention of Irregular Migration, Border Police Sector, Mrs. Stanica Popovic, Commanding General Director, General Directorate of Consular Affairs and Diaspora, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Tijana Simic from IOM Montenegro.
While from the Albanian side participated Mr. Ylli Kumrija, Head of the Immigration Sector, Directorate of Migration, Mr. Perlat Leli, Head of Risk Analysis in the Border and Migration Department, Mr. Enver Saliasi, Specialist in the Immigration Sector, Directorate of Migration and Mr. Pashko Lakaj, Head of the Migration Sector, DVKM Shkodër.
Since the beginning of 2018, the Western Balkans region has reemerged as a transit route for migrants towards the EU. This situation revealed an immediate need to further support a comprehensive migration management framework in WB, including the safe and orderly return and readmission of irregular migrants which is essential to enhance the effectiveness of policies in the field of international protection and legal migration. In this context, the authorities of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo* expressed need to further efforts in the area of readmission, especially in terms of establishing cooperation with the Country of Origins of irregular migrants.
The Western Balkans Readmission Capacity Building Facility aims to contribute to enhanced national migration management and readmission systems in the Western Balkans and strengthened cooperation with relevant countries of origin and EU Member States on readmission.

Title: Albania approves the second Justice for Children Strategy 2022-2026, drafted with UNICEF's technical assistance.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
10 February 2023
The Council of Ministers of Albania approves the second Justice for Children Strategy 2022-2026, drafted with UNICEF technical assistance. The new strategy builds on the achievements and lessons learned from the first Strategy 2018-2021. While addressing the remaining challenges, the new one, expands the scope of interventions from the criminal justice that dominated the 1st Strategy, towards equitable access to justice for every child and in various areas of law, such as civil, family, and administrative law. In that vein, the new Strategy’s vision is to guarantee child-friendly justice that protects their best interests. The mission envisages a collective action of public authorities, civil society and children and their families to shape a society that prevents juvenile offending and children’s victimization by crime, ensures a child-friendly justice system that provides remedies for violations of child rights, tailored to their needs, and contributes to their rehabilitation and reintegration, with a view to promote peace and security in our society and communities.
The Strategy, developed by the Ministry is a joint contribution of several experts from the Ministry and UNICEF specialists, and it reflects the views of various international and national stakeholders, including children and their families.
“On behalf of UNICEF, I would like to commend the Council of Ministers of Albania, and particularly the Minister of Justice, Ulsi Manja for their strong commitment to advance child rights and particularly their right to justice, as proclaimed by the Convention of the Rights of the Child and reaffirmed by the CRC Committee. The implementation of this Strategy requires the collective efforts, commitment, and support of all the three branches of governance and also requires wisely invested resources in those interventions that evidence shows they work. These are clearly the community-based and cross-disciplinary solutions, developed through a careful examination of the case of each individual child. UNICEF stands ready to continue its support for child-friendly justice in Albania, as part of the country’s overall efforts for justice system reform.”, says Roberto De Bernardi, UNICEF Representative.
The new Strategy is designed based on four outcomes :
1. Prevention of child delinquency and crimes against children;
2. A legal, institutional and professional framework that enables a friendly justice for every child;
3. Ensuring at all times access to friendly justice for every child;
4. Criminal justice that enables prevention of re-involvement of the child in crime, re-socialization and reintegration of the child in contact/ conflict with the law.
The Strategy demonstrates the political will of the Government of Albania to view justice for children as a crucial component of the Justice System Reform as well as a contributor to Albania’s compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals (2030) and its EU accession efforts.

The banking sector is one of the main pillars of the economy and its advancement in the future, including through managing of financing flows and financing for development, cooperations across the economy and introducing and supporting new technologies being launched both in the financial and real sector.
The United Nations in Albania held a fruitful meeting with the Albanian Association of Banks and the respective representatives of banking institutions in the country, to discuss and explore avenues where the banking system can further align itself with the values of the United Nations and those of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Throughout the meeting, the United Nations staff introduced the participants with concepts and ways towards an improved and beneficial approach towards cooperating for the SDGs. Currently, some of the banking institution in Albania are part of the UN Global Compact, mentioning some of the added values that it had brought to their companies in terms of benefiting the banking
institutions and consequently, their customers.
The United Nations Global Compact is a non-binding United Nations pact to encourage businesses and firms worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their implementation.
More participants expressed their interest in becoming part of the United Nations Global Compact, and additionally also in endorsing the UN’s Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), which stand to deliver greater equality for women in the workplace and beyond.
This meeting session proved to be effective and informative for the participants, and it was a first step towards a stronger cooperation between the United Nations and the banking institutions in Albania, to cooperate for more financing from and accelerating progress on Sustainable Development Goals in Albania.

08 February 2023
254 young people contributed to a #YouthManifesto for action against climate change in Albania. They submitted the Manifesto to the Ministry of Tourism and Environment calling for immediate interventions to protect the environment and improve air quality.
Their demands include improved urban transportation, conservation of water resources and forests, and infrastructure that is more accommodating for bicycles. Youth representatives from cities such as Shkodra, Berat, Elbasan, and Tirana participated in the project, raising awareness and calling for action to protect the environment.
The young activists had the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with Almira Xhembulla, Deputy Minister of Tourism and Environment, Edina Kozma, Deputy Representative of UNICEF in Albania, and representatives from the EDEN Centre, who were partners in the project.
In her remarks, Mrs. Xhembulla emphasized the importance of environmental education, the EU integration process, and Albania's obligations to implement conventions and action plans focused on combating climate change. She praised the young people for their involvement in environmental education and emphasized that everyone has a responsibility to protect the environment.
In her welcoming speech, Edina Kozma, emphasized the crucial role of partnership between young people, policymakers, civil society, businesses, and UNICEF. She also stressed the need to inspire young people to put the knowledge and skills they've gained in training and school activities into practice. She encouraged youth to remain involved in decision-making and climate change and air quality policy monitoring, which have a direct impact on their well-being, health, and the well-being of the community as a whole. Adequate government funding is also necessary to raise awareness around these issues.
The meeting with the deputy minister was closed with a commitment to continue the partnership and support youth initiatives aimed at improving air quality and protecting the environment.

Title: IOM - Countering Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling in the Western Balkans: key regional actors gather in Budva, Montenegro
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
08 February 2023
Budva - On February 6th and 7th 2023, key actors from the Western Balkans included in counter-trafficking and counter-smuggling response and other key actors representing international, EU, and regional levels (ie. UN, EU institutions/agencies, regional mechanisms) gathered in Montenegro at the Regional Conference: “Countering Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling in the Western Balkans“. The Conference served as a platform for mutual exchange on trends and modalities observed on enhancing systems and capacities to trafficking in human beings (THB) and smuggling of migrants (SOM). Additionally, it provided the platform to share the best practices and experiences, thereby facilitating joint approaches to common challenges to THB and SOM imposed in the digital age.
Participants came together in making an unanimous observation: the facilitation of trafficking and smuggling online is expected to become even more pronounced and lucrative in the coming years. While social media, mobile applications, and online gaming platforms are frequently used for various purposes, the use of cryptocurrencies by smuggling networks is and will complement the existing, traditional modalities of payment, such as Hawala system.  Criminal business are capitalizing on opportunities offered by the online environment and the digital solutions already omnipresent in the modus operandi of migrant smugglers and traffickers.
The digitalization of migrant smuggling and human trafficking further highlights the need for strengthened regional coordination. Mr. Dragan Klikovac, Assistant Police Director of Border Police Department of Montenegro, noted the crucial importance of such platforms increasing cooperation between Western Balkans partners. The Conference also offered an opportunity for WB6 partners to exchange on available software systems, tools, and digital forensics in tracing cryptocurrencies in THB and SOM activities, to proactively respond to the ever-evolving modus- operandi of organized crime networks.
Rights-based and victim-centered approach in the context of national and regional referral mechanisms was also at the center of the Conference’s proceedings. Experts and representatives from the Western Balkans exchanged experiences and knowledge on various methods for detection and running of in-depth investigations. Building on the Skopje Declaration, the Conference aimed to contribute to the broad objective of improving coordination and cooperation between Western Balkans partners on the topic, while working towards sustainable migration governance.
“We have seen the great efforts done in the areas of humanitarian assistance and immediate protection (…) but now the time is right for a shift into more long-term solutions when it comes to migration: more identification of people as soon as they enter the territory and also identification of what would be the best solutions for them in the Western Balkans but also beyond as well in the countries of origin”, noted Laura Lungarotti, IOM Sub-Regional Coordinator for the Western Balkans.

The Conference was organized by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), within the scope of the project „Joint Actions Against Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Human Beings“ (WBJAST), supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, in cooperation with the project "Countering Serious Crime in the Western Balkans IPA 2019" (CSC WB IPA 2019), supported by the European Union, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Italian Ministry of Interior, implemented by GIZ (The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit Gmbh), together with the Center for International Legal cooperation and the Ministry of the Interior affairs of Italy.
Since the beginning of 2015, the Western Balkans region, including Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo*, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, has emerged as a major transit hub for migrants attempting to reach the European Union.
The proposed Western Balkans Joint Actions Against Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Human Beings project aims to address these systemic gaps and concerns, while considering country specific priorities and needs. The initiative is contributing to better migration management of mixed migration flows in the Western Balkans through strengthening effective counter-smuggling and counter human trafficking practices, in line with protection sensitive approaches to assisting victims of trafficking.

Title: UN staff in Albania increase knowledge on gender sensitive data, monitoring and evaluation for better programme results.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
12 January 2023
UN Women in Albania, the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator (RCO), and the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia organized a training on Monitoring & Evaluation and Gender Data dedicated for UN staff involved in programme management. The training focused on gender sensitive monitoring, sex-disaggregated data collection and analysis, and gender responsive evaluation. More than 20 staff members from RCO, UNICEF, UNDP, UNHCR, UNFPA, UNOPS, UN Women and IOM participated in this training.
UN Resident Coordinator Fiona McCluney and UN Women Country Representative Michele Ribotta, who is also the chair of UN’s Gender Thematic and Results Group (GTRG) launched the training. Three trainers and specialists from UN Women Regional Office, Ceren Guven Gures, Ala Negruta and Isabel Suarez Garcia, led the sessions, using real-case scenarios. Participants learned how to formulate a gender-sensitive or gender-responsive indicators how to find reliable and comparable sex-disaggregated data and how to mainstream gender into the whole evaluation process.

Gender-responsive monitoring and evaluation helps assess whether a project’s planned activities are achieving gender equity goals and promote women’s rights. It provides feedback on how the activities affect the various groups of beneficiaries, including men and women. It is strongly linked to UN Country Team’s commitment to gender responsive governance by dedicating an outcome in the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026.

Title: Peace needed now, ‘more than ever’: Guterres
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
29 December 2022
After a year of brutal warfare from Afghanistan to Ukraine, forcing record numbers to flee their homes, the world needs peace in 2023 “more than ever”, said the UN Secretary-General, in his New Year message.
“Every New Year is a moment of rebirth”, said António Guterres. We sweep out the ashes of the old year and prepare for a brighter day. In 2022, millions of people around the world literally swept out ashes.”
The impact on civilians, meant that over 100 million people found themselves fleeing violence, wildfires, droughts, poverty and hunger, the UN chief said.
"In 2023, we need peace, now more than ever. Peace with one another, through dialogue to end conflict. Peace with nature and our climate, to build a more sustainable world."
Peace was also needed inside families and homes, “so women and girls can live in dignity and safety”, added Mr. Guterres, as well as peace on streets that too often have seen violent reprisals from security forces in response to peaceful protest.
Demonstrators and whole communities, need “the full protection of human rights”, he said, and for those with religious belief, there needs to be peace in places of worship, together with greater tolerance of other faiths.
There also needs to be peace online, he added, so instead of disinformation, and conspiracy theories, all societies can enjoy the Internet “free from hate speech and abuse.”
In 2023, let’s put peace at the heart of our words and actions”, said the Secretary-General.
“Together, let’s make 2023 a year when peace is restored to our lives, our homes, and our world.”

Title: A response to sexual abuse: UNICEF helps Albania introduce Barnhaus model of service
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
27 December 2022
UNICEF Albania launched in two Regions the first services for the immediate response to children’s victims of sexual abuse and other severe forms of violence.
Setting up specialized interdisciplinary services where the intervention of the different agencies is coordinated around the child is a milestone for UNICEF.
Serious cases of child sexual abuse and exploitation continue to come to public attention almost on weekly basis marking a continual increase.
The service model is based on the Barnhaus Quality Standards, as well as and standards of similar services in Europe, embedded in the health system, promoting practices that prevent (re)traumatization and are in accordance with the rights of children to protection, assistance and justice tailored to children's needs, as well as cooperating with the justice institutions in criminal proceeding relative to children's testimony.
The centres will provide 24/7 immediate response, core specialized services to the children victims of sexual abuse and other severe forms of violence. Interventions will be adapted to the complex needs and situations of each child. Multidisciplinary individual assessment and adaptation of interventions are at the core of this model of service. This model is child friendly, brings stakeholders under one roof to avoid child revictimization, and sets the basis for coordinated case management always preserving the child's best interest, ensuring child participation, and preventing any undue delay.

Title: Albania: UN expert hails women’s inclusion in government,  urges action on persons with disabilities
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
24 November 2022
TIRANA/GENEVA (24 November 2022)
Albania’s efforts to include women in government deserve recognition, but the country can do more to promote the participation of persons with disabilities and rural communities in political, economic and social development, a UN expert said today.
At the end of a 10-day visit to the country, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to development Saad Alfarargi, commended efforts by the Albanian Government to ensure women’s participation in governing and decision-making bodies, including the central government and civil service.
“Albania has achieved impressive progress in increasing the role of women in decision-making bodies,” Alfarargi said. “The country is also on its way to achieve a high level of women’s representation at management levels in the corporate sector,” he added.
The Special Rapporteur said he was pleased to hear from civil society organisations that they had been included in discussions leading to the formulation of domestic development policies and legislation.
“I am even more encouraged to learn that the participation of civil society in consultation processes related to the elaboration of national and local strategies and action plans, as well as budgeting, is mandated by several pieces of legislation,” the expert said.
Alfarargi highlighted remaining challenges concerning the inclusion of persons with disabilities in economic, social, political and cultural development, including the widespread lack of accessibility to public services and low representation in governance.
“I am also concerned that, despite the efforts of the government, the development of rural communities is lagging behind, leading to widespread poverty, unemployment and marginalisation of people living in remote and rural areas,” the UN expert said.
The Special Rapporteur’s detailed report on his visit and recommendations will be presented to the Human Rights Council in September 2023.

Title: UNOPS - Another milestone in improving the healthcare system of Albania!
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
16 November 2022
As a result of six-month long hard work, the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the Mother Teresa Hospital, serving more than 10,000 patients per year, has been transformed into a modern facility for medical care and diagnostic services. The 6,200 m2 hospital
built in 1973 had to be completely renovated, stripping the building up to the bricks and bringing and transforming it into a state-of-the-art hospital.
The inauguration ceremony brought together Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama, Minister of Health and Social Protection Ogerta Manastirliu, the World Bank Country Manager for Albania Emanuel Salinas, UNOPS Albania Country Manager Pamela Lama, the UNOPS Project Team, distinguished doctors, professors of the University of Medicine and healthcare professionals. We hope that this clinic will serve as an example that will be scaled up and replicated in other hospitals across the country
improving access for the Albanian citizens to high-quality healthcare services.
During the inauguration ceremony Minister of Health and Social Protection Mrs. Manastirliu noted: “Today we should feel proud for many aspects, but especially for the short time it took to implement this project. Like never before with a work of this scale
and quality, we fundamentally transformed the Infectious Disease Clinic starting in spring and completing the works in the fall. We really appreciate the World Bank for their support and facilitating complex procedures and UNOPS Albania staff, designers,
architects, engineers, supervisors and construction workers for their professionalism, dedication and attention to details. Thanks to each of you, even though the time limits were tight we were fast and managed to rebuild this hospital in line with the highest
European standards. The commitment by each of you resulted in a real national reference center for infectious diseases in line with the highest standards” “I think this investment is the best way to say thank you to all medical staff who turned into
heroes during the pandemic. By this investment we give the opportunity to all the doctors to work in optimal conditions with the highest international standards, equipment, logistics and necessary infrastructure, so what became a great history throughout the war with the invisible enemy to be inherited to the new generation as an inalienable spirit of the doctors’ work. I strongly believe that this investment will serve to create a bigger synergy and a noble sense of a team who showed themselves in the worst moments of the history of Albanian medicine since the foundation of the Albanian state” noted Edi Rama, Prime
Minister of Albania.
“Today is a very happy day for all of us. This facility is one of the critical pieces of infrastructure that is needed to deal with pandemics. A lot of investment that went into creating a facility that is at the top standard of European services. This is a project upon the request of the Government of Albania, Ministry of Health and Social Protection, but we did it in partnership with UNOPS and this has been a great collaboration, an ability to deliver results very rapidly and in a very challenging environment. This is one of eight hospitals we’re going to be working on. Altogether we expect that this will benefit more than 350 000 people in Albania. Even though it was done in the middle of a pandemic, it shows that whenever we dedicate ourselves we can achieve quite significant results in a very short period of time” noted World Bank Country Manager for Albania Emanuel Salinas.
The renovation works were conducted as a part of the COVID-19 emergency response project, implemented by UNOPS in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection through a World Bank loan to the Government of Albania.

Title: UNDP - Japan joins forces with UNDP Albania to accelerate actions on climate change promoting Solar Energy application
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
14 November 2022
Tirana, 14 November 2022: Funding from the Government of Japan supports implementation of Albania’s Nationally Determined Contribution on Climate Change in the area of Renewables -Solar Energy through UNDP Climate Promise Initiative from pledges-to -action.
The Embassy of Japan, UNDP, and the Agency for Energy Efficiency launched in Tirana the new initiative "Market transformation for solar power acceleration in Albania."
The Government of Japan has partnered with UNDP in Albania to accelerate the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Action Plan towards achieving the overall enhanced target and climate-resilient development, in response to the climate emergency.
A new project, "Market transformation for solar power acceleration in Albania," funded by the Japan Supplementary Budget -JSB with an amount of  USD 859,000 USD and implemented by UNDP, aims to assist Albania in implementing the new national target in response to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change by supporting the transition process towards diversification from hydropower and promoting alternative sources of renewable energy by 2030, accounting for 42 % of renewable energy (rather than large hydro) in gross final energy consumption".
The project will work to remove the market barriers and accelerate penetration of solar photovoltaic systems (solar PVs), reaching an additional installed capacity of 1000 kW through enabling the policy framework, ensuring availability of financing mechanisms, ensuring supply of reliable technology and services, and leveraging experience, and know-how from other countries with relevant advanced technologies, such as Japanese ones.
"The project will use Japanese technology know-how and technical expertise to help improve the policy framework and financing mechanisms, removing market barriers and facilitating the penetration of solar PV, while also ensuring the supply of reliable technology and services. At the same time, the project will implement at least 10 pilot projects in municipal buildings and rural communities," said Takada Mitsuyuki, Japan's Ambassador in Tirana.
"Investing in climate action makes smart economic sense and drives sustainable development. For instance, every dollar invested in renewables creates three times more jobs than that invested in the fossil fuel industry. I take the opportunity to congratulate the Government of Albania for their commitment and concrete steps towards energy diversification and promoting alternative sources of renewable energy. I also wish to acknowledge Albania for delivering the enhanced National Determined Contributions (NDC) and fulfilling its obligations as a party to the Climate Change Convention. Thanks to our core funding partners, the Government of Japan being among the most important ones, we were able to mobilize funds to deliver our UNDP Climate Portfolio. I wish to express our gratitude to the Government of Japan (through the Japan Supplementary Budget for decarbonization and climate change through promotion of Japanese technologies), for your partnership and funding of this important project," said Monica Merino, UNDP Resident Representative in Albania.
Some of the project interventions include targeted support for the national policies on solar energy following the revised law "On Renewable Energy" and financing mechanisms to boost the solar power market. The project targets municipal buildings and rural communities by installing pilot projects with high demonstration visibility and easy replication potential. Installation of pilot solar PV systems will also contribute to the development of skills for local producers/assemblers of solar panels as well as for service providers to operate and maintain them.

Title: Op-Ed: Eight Billion People - One Humanity
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
10 November 2022
By António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations
The world’s population will reach 8 billion in the middle of November – a testament to scientific breakthroughs and improvements in nutrition, public health and sanitation. But as our human family grows larger, it is also growing more divided.
Billions of people are struggling; hundreds of millions are facing hunger and even famine. Record numbers are on the move seeking opportunities and relief from debt and hardship, wars and climate disasters.
Unless we bridge the yawning chasm between the global haves and have-nots, we are setting ourselves up for an 8-billion-strong world filled with tensions and mistrust, crisis and conflict.
The facts speak for themselves. A handful of billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world. The top one percent globally pocket one fifth of the world’s income, while people in the richest countries can expect to live up to 30 years longer than those in the poorest. As the world has grown richer and healthier in recent decades, these inequalities have grown too.
On top of these long-term trends, the accelerating climate crisis and the unequal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are turbocharging inequalities. We are heading straight for climate catastrophe, while emissions and temperatures continue to rise. Floods, storms and droughts are devastating countries that contributed almost nothing to global heating.
The war in Ukraine is adding to ongoing food, energy and finance crises, hitting developing economies hardest. These inequalities take their greatest toll on women and girls, and on marginalized groups that already suffer discrimination.
Many countries in the Global South face huge debts, increasing poverty and hunger, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis. They have little chance of investing in a sustainable recovery from the pandemic, the transition to renewable energy, or education and training for the digital age.
Anger and resentment against developed countries are reaching breaking points.
Toxic divisions and lack of trust are causing delays and deadlock on a host of issues, from nuclear disarmament to terrorism to global health. We must curb these damaging trends, repair relationships and find joint solutions to our common challenges.
The first step is acknowledging that this runaway inequality is a choice, and one that developed countries have the responsibility to reverse – starting this month at the UN climate conference in Egypt and the G20 summit in Bali.
I hope COP27 will see a historic Climate Solidarity Pact under which developed and emerging economies unite around a common strategy and combine their capacities and resources for the benefit of humankind. Wealthier countries must provide key emerging economies with financial and technical support to transition away from fossil fuels. That is our only hope of meeting our climate goals.
I also urge leaders at COP27 to agree on a roadmap and institutional framework to compensate countries in the Global South for climate-related loss and damage that is already causing enormous suffering.
The G20 summit in Bali will be an opportunity to address the plight of developing countries. I have urged G20 economies to adopt a stimulus package that will provide governments of the Global South with investments and liquidity, and address debt relief and restructuring.
As we push for action on these medium-term measures, we are working non-stop with all stakeholders to ease the global food crisis.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative is an essential part of those efforts. It has helped to stabilize markets and bring food prices down. Every fraction of a percent has the potential to ease hunger and save lives.
We are also working to ensure Russian fertilizers can flow into global markets, which have been severely disrupted by the war. Fertilizer prices are up to three times higher than before the pandemic. Rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world, is the crop that will suffer most.
Removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian fertilizers is an essential step towards global food security.
But among all these serious challenges, there is some good news.
Our eight-billion-strong world could yield enormous opportunities for some of the poorest countries, where population growth is highest.
Relatively small investments in healthcare, education, gender equality and sustainable economic development could create a virtuous circle of development and growth, transforming economies and lives.
Within a few decades, today’s poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity across entire regions.
I never bet against human ingenuity, and I have enormous faith in human solidarity. In these difficult times, we would do well to remember the words of one of humanity’s wisest observers, Mahatma Gandhi: “The world has enough for everyone's need – but not everyone's greed.”
This month’s big global meetups must be an opportunity to start bridging divides and restoring trust, based on the equal rights and freedoms of every single member of humanity’s eight-billion-strong family.

Title: UNFPA - Human Papilloma virus vaccine is now available in Public Health Centers
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
05 November 2022
Every girl born in 2009 (13 years old) can be vaccinated free of charge in Albania against the Papilloma Virus that causes cervical cancer. UNFPA Albania joined forces with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection to ensure the implementation of the national campaign for the vaccination of girls aged 13 to prevent and increase their protection against cervical cancer.
The Papilloma virus is a common, infectious virus that can cause other diseases, but fortunately, now girls can be protected through the vaccine provided free of charge  in every health center.
The introduction of the vaccine in November 2022 completes a whole cycle of the National Programme for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer, which includes other elements like development of standards and protocols, cervical precancer screening, HPV testing, counselling, referral system, diagnosis, treatment/follow up, training of health care providers etc.
tart of the launch of the programme in 2019, more than 40,000 women have been screened. The Covid19 pandemic, almost halted the program, especially during 2020. In 2022 the programme came back on track to reach the target of having 20,000 women screened per year, also extending the age group of screened women.
The vaccination campaign against the HPV continues , as does the dedication of UNFPA Albania in close partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection  and the Institute of Public Health to fully implement the 10-year National Cancer Control Program.

Title: Youth4Health: Paving the way for WHO/Europe’s first-ever regional network of its kind
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
28 October 2022
Ensuring young people partner with governments and WHO to co-design policies and frameworks impacting their health and well-being
Over half of the people in the world, and about one in three people in the WHO European Region - encompassing 53 countries across Europe and Central Asia - are under 30. To help ensure that young people have a genuine say in policy decisions affecting their health and future, the WHO Regional Office for Europe has laid the foundation for Youth4Health, intended to be a landmark network of youth organizations and advocates representing diverse issues but underpinned by the principle of health as a human right accessible to one and all.
Youth4Health was convened this week as the first-ever WHO/Europe forum of its kind from October 25-27 in Tirana – the European Youth Capital for 2022 - in partnership with the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection, the Office of the Albanian Minister of State for Youth and Children, the Municipality of Tirana and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). About 500 young people from 30 countries participated in the forum along with almost 200 other delegates representing government, UN and civil society partners.
“It’s high time young people have a real say in health decision-making at all levels, moving beyond tokenism to genuine participation alongside governments and other authority figures,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe. “Young people aren’t the decision makers of tomorrow; they are actually the decision makers of today, experts of their own reality and experiences. For far too long, they’ve been ignored or condescended to. We’re joining forces with them to change that.”
Although young people represent diverse geographies and cultures, they face many of the same challenges when it comes to their health and well-being. From the long-running COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on mental and physical health, to socioeconomic challenges impacting opportunities in life, to the climate crisis impacting the survival of our entire planet. And, not least, sexual and reproductive health and rights – including and especially for the most excluded and marginalized populations.
“We, the youth, are often labelled the emerging future – but we are actually part of creating it here and now,” said Jack Kavanagh from Ireland, a health professional and youth advocate who suffered a life-changing spinal cord injury a decade ago, when he was barely 20. “We the youth are diverse in many ways including gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, mental health, disability. It’s time we had a seat at the table with the policy-shapers and decision-makers to ensure decisions about us are not taken without us.”
“In Albania, from a population of less than three million people, nearly 40 percent are young persons under 30,” noted Ogerta Manastirliu, Minister of Health and Social Protection of Albania. “In recent years, and especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been strengthening our efforts to address their health needs – including a priority focus on mental health. Youth engagement is essential to help shape, refine and achieve this.”
“The Tirana Municipality has made significant advances in making city spaces more conducive to health and fitness activities, with a focus on the needs of children and youth,” said Erion Veliaj, Mayor of Tirana. “Much of this was done through feedback from young persons. Moreover, during the pandemic we worked closely with health authorities to find ways to lessen the mental health impact of social distancing and other measures that were taking a toll on our young persons. Through the process, we’ve realized how crucial it is to make youth part of our decision-making processes to ensure stronger buy-in and better outcomes.”
“Youth empowerment shouldn’t just begin when someone is in their teens, but rather from childhood itself, through opportunities to learn, grow and lead,” said Bora Muzhaqi, Albanian Minister of State for Youth and Children. “Comprehensive sexuality education, which incorporates lessons on gender equality, diversity and inclusion, paves the way for young persons to speak for themselves with greater confidence from an earlier age, carving out their own space in a world where adults often choose to ignore them.”
When planning the Youth4Health forum, WHO/Europe and partners took care to ensure that young people themselves helped craft the agenda through consultations organized via WHO country offices and partners in the Region, resulting in a number of priority issues shortlisted for discussion across the three days, including mental health; sexual and reproductive health; misinformation or fake news about COVID-19 and other health issues; and the climate crisis and its damaging health consequences.
“Youth need full access to appropriate and confidential health care services, including sexual and reproductive health services, but in many countries that is not yet a reality, and in others we’re seeing growing pushback on progress made previously,” noted Marta Diavolova, the United Nations Population Fund’s Strategic Partnerships Adviser for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. “Young persons must be given the platform they need to advocate for their rights and choices, and UNFPA – the UN’s sexual and reproductive health agency – aims to do just that, in partnership with WHO and other stakeholders.”
Delegates at Youth4Health concluded the forum by issuing a blueprint with concrete action points.
“For Youth4Health, the road from Tirana leads to Almaty, Kazakhstan, where we will hold the 2023 WHO/Europe Regional Committee, our highest decision-making body, comprising of health ministers of all our 53 Member States,” said Dr Kluge. “There, in September next year, we’ll request countries to endorse Youth4Health, which will help strengthen youth inclusion at the regional and national level. As well, WHO/Europe will help weave Youth4Health into existing regional initiatives, like the Pan-European Mental Health Coalition, to give network members the exposure to how WHO and its Member States work. We are determined to move from tokenism to full-fledged inclusion for youth. We invite the Youth4Health membership to help us chart the roadmap that will get us there. As one delegate this week told us, ‘Just ask the young people. They know everything.”

Title: Building back better - Strengthening the work on mental health in the Western Balkans
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
24 October 2022
News from the World Health Organization in Albania
In recent years, there has been increasing acknowledgment of the important role mental health plays in achieving global development goals, as illustrated by the inclusion of mental health in the Sustainable Development Goals. Depression is one of the leading causes of disability. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. People with severe mental health conditions die prematurely – as much as two decades early – due to preventable physical conditions.
Despite progress in some countries, people with mental health conditions often experience severe human rights violations, discrimination, and stigma. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet the gap between people needing care and those with access to care remains substantial. Effective treatment coverage remains extremely low.
In October, a sub-regional meeting on mental health was held in Albania with 25 experts from the Western Balkans. During the meeting partners re-committed to historical mental health reforms in the Western Balkans. Including policy frameworks for suicide prevention, further expansion of community-based mental health services, and enabling primary healthcare to play a crucial role in prevention, treatment, and care for people living with mental health conditions.
More specifically, discussions were held on:
- mental health policies;
- mental health and well-being of children, adolescents, and young people;
- digitalization of mental health care;
- and integration of mental health in primary health care.
Mental health is one of the four flagship priorities of the European Programme of Work (EPW) of the WHO European Region. The European Framework for Action on Mental Health 2021-2025 (EFAMH) has identified its objectives as per the three core pillars of the EPW: Moving Towards Universal Health Coverage, Protecting People Better from Health Emergencies, and Ensuring Healthy Lives and Well-being for All at All Ages.
Mental health is also one of the five initiatives highlighted in the Roadmap for Health and Well-being in the Western Balkans (2021-2025) with the target to establish a subregional hub under the Pan-European Mental Health Coalition and maximize expertise. We are glad to see many engaged stakeholders working together in one room for inclusive and sustainable mental health care in the Western Balkans.

Title: OpEd: Values that bring us together: Celebrating the United Nations Week in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
23 October 2022
By Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator in Albania
This coming Monday, the 19 agencies that make up the United Nations’ family in Albania, in cooperation with the Government and several municipalities, will kick off United Nations Week.  This year’s edition forms part of the International Culture Weeks as part of Albania Welcomes the World.
United Nations Day, which is celebrated every 24 October, marks the date in 1945 when the UN Charter entered into force.  It offers the opportunity to reaffirm the fundamental purposes and principles that have guided us ever since.
There is a growing urgency to remember these values, which also underpin the UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ landmark report, Our Common Agenda, launched last year.
The Secretary-General drew attention to six divides that challenge our times. Together, we must address the peace divide by investing in prevention and peacekeeping;  the climate divide, by mitigating climate change and meeting concrete emission-reduction targets; the gap between rich and poor, within and between countries; the gender divide, addressing persistent inequalities between women and men; the digital divide, ensuring that everyone benefits, and that data is safe; and the divide between generations, including stronger engagement with our young people as inheritors of the results of our decisions, and  make sure they are part of decision-making.
In his powerful speech  to the UN General Assembly this September, the Secretary-General continued to raise the alarm: ‘Let’s have no illusions. We are in rough seas. A winter of global discontent is on the horizon. A cost-of-living crisis is raging. Trust is crumbling. Inequalities are exploding. Our planet is burning. People are hurting – with the most vulnerable suffering the most. The United Nations Charter and the ideals it represents are in jeopardy. We have a duty to act.’
As an elected member of the UN Security Council, Albania has earned global recognition for its contributions to the global peace and security agenda. This United Nations Week gives us an opportunity to remember the importance of the values etched into the UN charter, and how relevant they remain today, in securing human rights, peace, and sustainable development. Together with our Albanian partners we will echo the values that Albania brings to the global stage.
During this week we will highlight the work being undertaken by the UN in Albania in partnership with the Government on a whole range of issues: migration, health and wellbeing, food and agriculture, environment, education and employment, social protection, gender equality and culture. These efforts all form part of the country’s commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals – 17 interlocking, transformative and truly global targets adopted by the international community in 2015 and meant to be reached by 2030.
In concrete terms here in Albania, the goals are the core of the   2022-2026 plan drawn up by the UN and the Government, known as the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. Together with the Government, the UN is committed to assist Albanians in hitting these goals to improve everyone’s lives. They are also inextricably linked to Albania’s EU integration agenda.
On United Nations Day, in the very heart of Tirana at the Skanderbeg Square, we will unveil the large-scale ‘We the Peoples’ outdoor exhibition, referencing the opening words of the UN Charter.  To demonstrate the importance of inclusion and leaving no one behind on the road to sustainable development, we will showcase a unique work by a young Albanian artist, made up of 999 portraits from all over Albania--people from all age groups, origins, religious faiths, gender, and sexual orientation.
This year, Albania really has underscored its commitment to advancing the work of the entire United Nations, at home and beyond. On this United Nations Day, let us celebrate the global values that bring us together, with a pledge to accelerate actions to bring peace and a sustainable future for all.

Title: A new high tech scanner will help Trauma Hospital doctors save lives
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 October 2022
Health and Covid-19 Response
Sometimes, after a day packed with back-to-back meetings and tackling endless work issues and big and small challenges, it is easy to overlook a full-picture and forget about the impact we are making in people's lives. A recent visit to the main Trauma Hospital in Tirana, that treats on average 500 emergency patients per month from all over Albania, and a chance to talk to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and the doctors working for the hospital reminded how our daily teamwork puzzle together to result in a real and tangible change in the lives of people we serve.
Health professionals couldn’t conceal their excitement when they showed the Prime Minister a new CT scanner  procured within COVID-19 emergency response project implemented by UNOPS Albania and funded through a World Bank loan to the Albanian Government, led by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection.
“This is the newest device that came to our hospital and to Albania. It is the latest generation that is suitable for all types of examinations that this hospital covers. With this device we can accurately examine the patient's entire body in just three minutes. And now we can examine 20 patients in just one hour”- underlined Dr. Elvis Veli, the Head of Radiology Imaging Department.
“I have seen many emergency patients in my life. I have seen people, especially young people, who lost their lives because it was not possible to diagnose them correctly and quickly enough. But now, with this scanner, our doctors can accurately detect fractures or hemorrhages, giving many people a chance to survive"- noted Dr. Admir Mustafa, a Radiology doctor.
“UNOPS has been constantly cooperating with us all the time while working both on the infrastructure, setting up the room and installing the equipment, modifying it in line with our needs” - noted Edlira Bode, an Otorhinolaryngology doctor and the Director of the Trauma Hospital.
“Up to now we have made the largest investment ever in biomedical equipment for both inpatient and outpatient services. We will install 18 digital x-rays (mobile and installed), four CT scanners and one angiography. UNOPS colleagues have made it possible to realize these investments very quickly, while in parallel completing renovation of the Infectious Disease Clinic” - noted the Minister.
Earlier this year, in order to improve the quality and speed of diagnosis, UNOPS supplied eight hospitals in Rrogozhinë, Mallakaster, Përmet, Tepelenë, Tropojë, Pukë, Divjakë and Mirditë with state of art mobile digital X-Rays, as a part of World Bank EUR 544,704.00 investment. In addition to procuring the equipment and upgrading the facilities, UNOPS has provided training to the medical staff. Patients in these communities now have access to top-quality, digitized X-Ray diagnostics.

News from ITU
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is providing support to the National Authority on Electronic Certification and Cybersecurity (NAECCS/ AKCESK) of Albania in rolling out the ITU Child Online Protection Guidelines at the national level. The objective is to foster a culture of child online protection with all relevant stakeholders through knowledge sharing and digital skills development.
As of October 2022, 190 secondary school students, 460 parents and educators, as well as 100 experts from Child Online Protection Units and Industry operators from 12 regions in the country have been trained on COP, and how to protect children from online risks and harms and better cope with such risks. In addition, 4500 single viewers have been reached through a COP-dedicated social media campaign. Circa 500 people engaged by following the NAECCS’s social media channels and more than 100 people have participated in quizzes shared on Instagram stories.
In addition, to the training, a child-friendly manual was elaborated based on the COP Guidelines and served as a background document for training sessions targeting children and the youth. A Unified message targeting Industry stakeholders was also developed with the aim to  raise awareness on how to increase the security of children online in order to harmonize policies and regulations across the country.

Title: Work begins on the design of the program for the Farm Accounting Data Network in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
07 September 2022
News from FAO
Tirana, Albania - Considered as one of the key issues for the design and development of comprehensive agricultural policies for family farms, in the promotion of rural development, the increase of rural welfare and the preservation of heritage, work has begun on the design of the program for the Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN). Albania's support in this process comes within the framework of the "EU Integration and Policy Support in Agriculture and Rural Development" project, funded by FAO, and focuses on comprehensive policies towards family farms, with the objective of promoting rural businesses, increasing well-being rural and family economy.
As a crucial component for the farm economy in Albania, due to the importance of the design of the FADN system in the collection, processing, analysis and monitoring of annual farm income, FAO is committed to supporting its partners, based on EU best practices.
During preliminary consultations with the line ministry and the main actors in the process, a hybrid meeting was held in Tirana at the end of June, with the presence of FAO regional experts, where the discussants emphasized the importance of designing the FADN system in the orientation of Albanian agriculture, clearly followed by Albania's ambition to join the European Union. In this context, the preconditions included by the acquis communautaire, which are related to the approximation of the legislation of the regulatory framework, as well as the proper functioning of the common European policy, are a compass for the Ministry of Agriculture and Agriculture and Rural Development. "The drafting of the FADN system comes not only as a request of the EU, but provides a basis for the national agricultural policy supported by well-collected and well-managed data, promoting transparency in agriculture and strengthening Albania's position for the EU . membership", said Agim Pepkolaj, the national coordinator of the FAO project.
In this context, with the support of FAO, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development of Kosovo, specifically the Department of Economic Analysis and Agricultural Statistics, hosted the working group from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Albania and the FAO representative. in Albania, in order to increase capacities and exchange experiences for the development and implementation of the FADN system in Albania. During the three-day seminar in Pristina, has been discussed the action plan for the technical agreements between the two governments signed on June 20, 2022 by the respective ministers of both countries, Frida Krifca and Faton Peci, which aim at close cooperation between the two countries and exchange of experiences.
FADN in Albania plans to collect microeconomic data on agricultural farms with a focus only on commercial farms and not on small family farms. The engagement of the FADN technical group will contribute to the preparation of the FADN regulation, farm selection plan, data collection methodology, farm structure tables, farm standard product, questionnaire realization, software technical specifications, testing and their functionalization.

Title: UNOPS is transforming hospitals across Albania into  modern state-of-the-art medical care and diagnostic services facilities
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
05 September 2022
Improving diagnostics capacities in hospitals across Albania is well underway
As a part of the COVID-19 emergency response project, implemented by UNOPS in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection through a World Bank loan, the renovation works at the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC), within the Mother Teresa Hospital in Tirana, have progressed significantly and will be completed in October 2022.  The works, worth EUR 5.61 million, will transform the IDC into a state-of-the-art modern clinic serving more than 10,000 patients a year.  After renovation, the clinic will have 16 emergency beds, 8 Intensive Care Units (ICU) and 87 ward beds and improve life-saving medical services to the people in need.
During her recent joint inspection visit with Prime Minister of Albania Edi Rama, the Minister of Health and Social Protection Ogerta Manastirliu noted that UNOPS is ensuring  the highest standards of procurement and renovation works.
“The new hospital set-up will enable us to respond to public health emergencies in the most efficient way. It will have twice as many reanimation beds,  contemporary medical equipment, a laboratory, lecture hall for university students and waiting areas for the patients’ relatives” underlined Ms Manastirliu.
In parallel, UNOPS has renovated and installed state-of-art CT scanners at the hospitals of Shefqet Ndroqi, Korca and Trauma (Tirana). Additionally,  three X-Ray rooms installed  in hospitals in Lac, Vore and Paskuqan will allow local residents to receive timely and high-quality medical services. These are the latest UNOPS deliveries aimed at improving the diagnostics capacity in 15 imaging centers in 13 hospitals across Albania. Through this effort, Albanian citizens and healthcare providers will benefit from an additional capacity of 10 Digital X-Ray systems, 4 CT scanners and 1 Angiography system.
Additionally, in September 2022 UNOPS will provide 12 hospitals throughout Albania with 8 mobile X-Rays and 4 all-purpose Ultrasounds. This high-tech equipment will enable radiologists to increase the speed and quality of diagnostic services for the coming decade.

Title: Bringing information and Covid-19 vaccination closer to communities in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
31 August 2022
UN Albania Covid-19 Response
Vaccination is key to protecting individuals and communities from severe illness due to COVID-19. However, only around 46.9% of Albania’s total population has been vaccinated against COVID-19 and only 12.2% of people have had their booster shot, leaving large numbers of people unprotected from the potentially severe effects of the virus.
Caravan for Health
To address the low vaccination uptake, WHO together with the Albanian Red Cross funded by USAID organized a “caravan”, or a series of pop-up clinics in public spaces, to bring COVID-19 information and vaccines closer to the people who need them. The caravan has been traveling around Albania during the summer months, aiming at encouraging COVID-19 vaccination uptake among the general public and promoting acceptance of social and public health measures. The first tour just came to an end but a second one will start during fall 2022. In addition to on-the-spot vaccinations, the caravan teams, consisting of medical professionals and Red Cross volunteers, has been engaging with local communities, providing them with accurate information on COVID-19 vaccines and other topics, answering questions, and providing advice based on people’s perceptions and concerns. Tote bags including protective equipment was also handed out. Red Cross volunteers also reached out to communities to inform them about the caravan before its arrival to ensure that the communities were well informed.
So far, there has been participation and engagement in 6 Municipalities, 10 Administrative units. More than 1500 people have been reached through the initiative. The number of COVID-19 doses administered varies from 12-30 for each site. An increased number of people visiting the vaccination centres in the respective localities, in the days following the Caravan for Health has also been noted.
Door-to-door vaccination
Another initiative, funded by both USAID and the EU, is door-to-door vaccination offered to the older population and people with underlying health conditions in Albania. The initiative strives to increase the accessibility to vaccination, especially in rural and hard-to-reach areas. With this initiative, people do not have to visit the primary healthcare clinic to get vaccinated, but healthcare personnel give visits to people's homes. For the past months, seven mobile teams have been traveling around Albania.
Figures:
Vaccination through mobile teams in the remote and underserved communities in Figures:
WHO has implemented several activities designed to increase vaccine uptake over the last years using various approaches to reach different communities. Community-tailored activities continue to be important to ensure accessible vaccines and reliable information for all.
Getting vaccinated is key – the pandemic is not over
Billions of people around the world have been vaccinated against COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself against COVID-19, help ends the pandemic, and stop new variants from emerging. The pandemic is not over.

Title: WHO and USAID for a strong cold chain capacity in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 August 2022
UN Albania Covid-19 Response
Delivering vaccines to all corners of Albania is a complex task. It takes a chain of precisely coordinated events in temperature-controlled environments to store, manage and transport these life-saving products. This is called a cold chain.
Vaccines must be continuously stored in a specific temperature range – from the time they are manufactured until the moment of vaccination. This is because temperatures that are too high or too low can cause the vaccine to lose its power. Once a vaccine loses its power, it cannot be regained or restored.
With funding from USAID, WHO is currently installing three new cold rooms to strengthen the cold chain capacity in Albania. During summer one of these, cold rooms was installed in Rrëshen, Mirdite, Albania.
Dr. Aleksander Dodaj, Director of the Local Public Health Unit in Mirditë, expressed his gratitude saying: "The new cold room will not only benefit people living in Mirditë but from the whole north-east region, including Puka, Tropoja, and Kukës. This cold room will come to good use both for COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines"
In total, six cold rooms, and 103 refrigerators for vaccines have been installed and distributed to health facilities across Albania.

Title: UNOPS and EU4Culture engage scholars to reveal new pages of Albanian history
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 August 2022
News from UNOPS in Albania
Archaeologists and historians have a group of unlikely allies: trees. Dendrochronology, the scientific method of studying tree rings, can pinpoint the age of archaeological sites using information stored inside old wood. Originally developed for climate science, the method is now an invaluable tool for archaeologists and historians, who can track up to 13,000 years of history using tree ring chronologies.
Today, dendrochronology is a critical tool for helping date archaeological sites and artifacts in Albania and across the world. The term was derived from the ancient Greek words for tree (dendron) and time (khronos).
When historians or archaeologists recover timbers during excavations or renovations, like last month during renovations works at the Ethnographic Museums in Kruja and Kavaja, they either cut full cross-section or retrieve cross-section cores, then compare them to regional chronologies to find matching ring patterns and determine a site’s age. Differing ages in specimens can reveal waves of construction at a particular site, or reveal migration and trade patterns with pieces of wood that were not cut locally.
Today,  we spoke with Doctor Esmeralda Agolli, an Associate Professor at the Department of Archaeology and Culture Heritage of the University of Tirana, to understand how cultural heritage sites renovated under the EU-funded EU4Culture programme implemented by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) become platforms helping scholars to shed light on Albanian history.
“The restoration project carried out in the Ethnographic Museums of Kruja and Kavaja have offered the unique opportunity to unveil in these houses a myriad of details regarding their architecture, transformation over time, building material and above to what extent all these features reflect life and action within and outside these two compounds.
Such opportunity has proven precious also for allowing systematic research in the material properties of each house. With the wooden structure in particular, analysis of absolute dating through dendrochronology and wood anatomy have been one most recent endeavor in which the EU4Culture project is cooperating with the Department of Archaeology and Culture Heritage at Tirana University and the Balkan-Aegean-Dendrochronology project.
We aim to collect wooden samples from these two houses and later explore the wooden structures of the castle of Bashtova. Above all, such a unique opportunity allows us to apply a non-destructive methodology – only by obtaining samples from wooden materials which due to their poor state of preservation are to be removed. In addition, we are attempting to be comprehensive and collect wooden pieces from every structure of the building.
A high profile of researchers will conduct analysis to the collected samples and focus mainly on dendrochronology and wood anatomy. Quite enthusiastically, we expect the results to highlight some interesting matters. The analysis of the tree rings will contribute to obtaining absolute dates for the construction of the houses. Perhaps some dynamics of various phases of constructions could interestingly be revealed too. So far, both houses and the castle of Bashtove are solely dated conventionally, by considering mostly the architectural features and general historic sources.
Analysis on wood anatomy will indeed contribute to understanding the origin and the typology of wood used as building material. Here we open our horizons on issues that regard the exploration of the environment, availability of raw material in the regions of Kavaja and Kruja, and possibly routes of the movement of goods.
This is seminal research in Albania and indeed could inspire further studies and explorations to wood material and beyond. Exciting discoveries lie ahead!”

Title: WHO: Refugee and migrant health - a global health priority
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
01 August 2022
UN Albania Covid-19 Response
Worldwide, more people are on the move now than ever before, yet many refugees and migrants face poorer health outcomes than the host populations. Addressing their health needs is, therefore, a global health priority and integral to the principle of the right to health for all. The key is to strengthen and maintain health systems by ensuring that they are refugee- and migrant-sensitive and inclusive.
Health outcomes are influenced by a whole list of factors. However, refugees and migrants face additional determinants such as precarious legal status; discrimination; social, cultural, linguistic, administrative, and financial barriers; lack of information about health entitlements; low health literacy; and fear of detention and deportation.
WHO is working closely with countries and partners to advocate for the inclusion of refugees and migrants in all aspects of the covid-19 pandemic response, including access to reliable information, treatment and care, and vaccination.
In collaboration with the organization Refugee and Migrant Services in Albania (RMSA), funded by USAID, WHO is currently supporting an initiative to better address health needs of refugees and migrants in Albania by informing and providing them with initial medical check-up and follow-up as per their needs. This is done via stationary and mobile medical teams, offering Covid-19 testing, and facilitating Covid-19 vaccination, as well as providing health information in their native languages. The translation is also offered during medical check-ups to ensure good communication between the patient and the medical professionals.

12 July 2022
Protecting People
The “Friends of the Children” Parliamentary Group held a hearing session in the presence of the Speaker of the Parliament, Ms. Lindita Nikolla, UNHCR Albania’s Representative, Mr. Pablo Zapata, UNICEF’s Albania Representative, Mr. Roberto de Bernardi, People’s Advocate, the Commissioner for Protection Against Discrimination, and other relevant actors.
The subject of this hearing session was the issues related to the protection of non-nationals unaccompanied and separated children arriving in Albania as part of mix migration flows.
Speaker Ms. Nikolla said that in recent years, there has been an increase in the flow of refugees, asylum seekers and children, in the context of migratory flows. The migratory panorama and the structure of flows is being modified by the latter, recording a change in the trend and dynamics of contemporary migratory waves, i.e., the predominance of flows of an economic nature. Worrying is the fact that some of them who seek to leave Albania use or fall into the networks of smugglers and traffickers of human beings.
In his speech, Mr. Zapata highlighted the work done by the government, but also stated that there is need for procedural changes and need for increasing the local government’s capacities to receive and treat children who enter the territory of Albania. He marked the fact that the situation is growing due to the situation in Ukraine.
In his word, Dr. de Bernardi valued the engagement of Albania and of the Parliament but highlighted the need for improvements in identification of non-national UASC, better access to social and other services and the harmonization of the legislation. He mentioned the need to increase institutional capacities for treating and caring for children who enter the territory of Albania.
The Albanian Parliamentarians, members the of “Friends of the Children”, highlighted the need for improvement of the legislations, procedures, institutional capacities and human resources for the treatment and protection of non-nationals unaccompanied and separated children arriving in Albania as part of mix migration flows. The MP’s requested to from UNICEF and UNHCR to provide proposals for the improvement of legal framework on the topic of non-national UASC.

Title: FAO helps Albania boost dairy development and ensure a comprehensive approach to increase productivity
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
07 July 2022
News from FAO
Tirana, Albania - As part of the FAO project "Supporting the dairy value chain for a more competitive and inclusive sector", together with our partners we gathered to discuss issues affecting the most sensitive livestock sector, improve competitiveness, increase productivity and achieve food standards. The project comes as a response to a rapidly declining milk sector in the country, which needs an intervention for a new success story in the Albanian milk sector.
The meeting of high representatives, that took place on July 1, in Tirana, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in cooperation with FAO, presented the findings of a basic study on the existing quantity and quality of fresh milk, as well as the way for improving market access of smallholders. At the meeting were present the ambassador of the Netherlands Reinout Vos, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Frida Krifca, the FAO representative for Albania, Raimund Jehle, national and international partners, who have contributed to the development program of the dairy sector in Albania.
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Frida Krifca, stressed that the livestock sector is one of the ministry's priorities, as one of the sectors that is undergoing significant changes, from the structure of family livestock farms, the number of heads, the decrease of milk production. "There is an immediate need at this moment in the sector, to increase investment, invest in human capacity and farmers' education, to increase production yield and ensure a consolidated value chain. And this ambitious goal cannot be fully achieved without the involvement of all international actors and donors", said Minister Krifca. Thanking FAO as a strategic partner, she encouraged the support of the Ministry for the implementation of integrated measures plan of this sector and in particular the support of the sector and the social layer that it is represented.
FAO representative for Albania, Raimund Jehle, focusing on the difficult times we live in and its implications, COVID-19, the increase in the price of oil, the implications of the conflict in Ukraine in the food price crisis and the price increase in fertilizers, expressed that the strengthening of global production and the efficiency of the agricultural sector requires more attention."Strengthening the dairy sector is a key element, as it is a potential for the country, as the dairy sector is linked to domestic exports and tourism. This project aims to support the sector based on the results of the surveys and analysis, in the implementation of new program by adding value in technology and innovation, and together with our partners, to support the value chain of the dairy sector", said Jehle. Adding that the effect is positive, as even in times of crisis we are able to invest in this sector and guarantee safety, leaving no one behind.
The project will contribute to the design of "Dairy development program" which creates a comprehensive approach to increase productivity, to ensure the collection of high quality raw milk, to maintain quality standards and fast delivery to the processing plant at the lower cost.
The project is in the framework of Country Programming Framework for the Republic of Albania, and is linked to FAO Regional initiatives to RI1. Empowering smallholders, family farms and youth, facilitating rural livelihoods and poverty reduction and RI2. Transforming food systems and facilitating market access and integration.

- A farewell event for ambassador Adrian Maître
UN Country Team in Albania invited Swiss Ambassador to Albania, Mr Adrian Maître to a UN House to review and celebrate joint achievements in working for sustainable development and wish him well on next chapter of career as he ends his posting in Albania.

“Switzerland is the second biggest contributor in our current Programme of Cooperation and to the SDG Acceleration Fund. UN is thankful to the close partnership with Switzerland, and with Ambassador Maître in particular” – said UN Resident Coordinator, Fiona McCluney.
Ambassador Maître highlighted the successful cooperation with the UN Family in Albania in promoting multilateralism and common interests in Security Council, as well as with Swiss support including on Territorial and Administrative Reform; Skills Development for Employment and Leaving No One Behind. UN Albania and Swiss Embassy recently signed the second phase of Leave No Behind (LNB) Programme which extended improvements to social protection to more municipalities with a- budget 8 million Swiss Franc, implemented over 5 years through the SDG Acceleration Fund.
The Leave No One Behind project, is a flagship programme that has introduced new sustainable approaches to social protection and inclusion with provision of new facilities, support from Swiss academic links and the dedicated and coordinated efforts of four UN Agencies - UNICEF, UN Women and UNFPA, with UNDP in the lead, great partnership with the Government both at the central and local level and engaging various stakeholders, communities and CSOs.
Thanks to this project, tangible results were achieved by positively affecting the lives of vulnerable communities, demonstrating increased and more equitable investment in people, removing barriers, and creating opportunities for those at risk of exclusion. The project has affected the lives of around 200,000 vulnerable groups, people with disabilities, Roma and Egyptians. More than half of the municipalities were supported in preparing and implementing social care plans, professionals at the municipalities were trained, and mechanisms to provide were strengthened. LNB served also to support vulnerable groups during the Covid pandemic.
At the end of event Ms McCluney handed Ambassador Maître a small gift to honor the Ambassador’s dedication to achievement of sustainable development goals in Albania.

Title: Don't rely on gossip! Misinformation surrounding COVID-19 continues to undermine confidence and vaccination efforts aimed at ending the pandemic.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 June 2022
However, the challenge and reluctance to vaccines is more a problem of the community and the false words being circulated and has little to do with the vaccines themselves. In this light, the epidemiological and social crises caused by COVID-19 have magnified widespread social anxiety and trust issues that, in the unique circumstances of this global pandemic, have exacerbated vaccine skepticism. Trust is key to overcoming vaccine hesitancy, especially in a context of widespread social uncertainty caused by the pandemic, where feelings and thoughts can be volatile. Based on the words and comments circulating on social networks, with the support of USAID and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, UNICEF has undertaken an awareness campaign on the safety and prevention of COVID 19, avoiding misinformation and strengthening confidence in vaccines in the country ours.
It has already been 2 years since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that, alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, the world was also battling an 'infodemic' - an "overflow of information, both online and in various social groups, at school, at work, everywhere."
Even in our country, from the first moments and until today, there have been many words and conspiracy theories about the vaccine and the side effects it causes.

Vaccines are one of the greatest scientific innovations of all time. In the last century, they have brought us closer to ending polio and helped us eradicate smallpox. Thanks to vaccines, billions of people today live healthy lives protected from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.
As with anything new, it is important to know and rely only on experts and official sources of information in order to avoid the untrue words that are circulating. The vaccine brings us closer to normal life and all the activities that we like, it gives us the opportunity to protect not only ourselves but also all those who cannot be vaccinated.

Thanks to vaccination, we can safely go to school and work, we can protect our grandparents and we can return to normal life.
Don't rely on gossip!
Choose life, choose vaccination!

Get informed only from official sources on measures and vaccination against Covid-19!

29 June 2022
As a part of the COVID-19 emergency response project, implemented by UNOPS in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection through a World Bank loan, the first 128-slice CT scanner room was handed over to the hospital of Shefqet Ndroqi. This is one of the latest UNOPS deliveries aimed at improving the diagnostics capacity in 15 imaging centers covering 13 hospitals across Albania. Through this effort, Albania will benefit an additional capacity of 10 Digital X-Ray systems, 4 CT scanners, 1 Angiography system.
This high-tech equipment will enable radiologists to increase the speed and quality of diagnostic services for the coming decade. In addition to renovating radiology rooms, UNOPS provided state-of-art equipment, including four CT scanners, ten Digital X-Rays and one Angiography unit.  In July most of the renovated radiology rooms will receive additional equipment.
In parallel UNOPS has progressed significantly with renovation works at the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) within the Mother Teresa Hospital in Tirana.  The works, worth EUR 5.61 million, will transform the IDC into a state-of-the-art modern clinic serving more than 10,000 patients a year.  After renovation, the clinic will have 16 emergency beds, 8 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 87 ward beds and improve life-saving medical services to the people in need.
During a recent inspection visit to the Clinic the Prime Minister Edi Rama and the Minister of Health Ogerta Manastirliu noted: "We have conducted the procurement procedures through UNOPS to guarantee the best standards and meeting deadlines"

- The project contributes to the development of an action plan for the sustainable use of plant protection products and to the improvement of the capacities of the various actors involved in the plant protection sector in Albania.
FAO in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) completed consultations with key project actors to support the finalization of the Action Plan for the sustainable use of plant protection products (PPP). Based on previous consultations, a roadmap with recommendations on the areas for intervention was presented at a meeting with line ministries and other key stakeholders.
Present at the meeting, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mrs. Ermira Gjeçi, praised the work done in cooperation with FAO, and stressed the importance of consultations with stakeholders to discuss the roadmap and areas for improving the draft action plan.
The project aims to support MARD for the implementation of the action and training plan for the staff. Part of the intervention is the exchange of experiences with EU countries already implementing the action plan on pesticides.
Speaking on the added value of the project to improving Albania’s capacities in the area of plant protection, the FAO’s Project Manager in Albania, Agim Pepkolaj said: “We at FAO are encouraging the Albanian government to maintain its commitment to ensure that integrated pest management (IPM) is one of the key aspects of the action plan and the training plan should be implemented and promoted to government officials, farmers, and plant protection companies”.
The action plan 2022-2032 for sustainable use of PPP in Albania and training plan are prepared in consultation with FAO experts and technical working group from beneficiary government entities such as: Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (National Veterinary and Plant Protection Authority, Institute of Food Safety and Veterinary, National Food Authority), Ministry of Tourism and Environment and Ministry of Health. MARD plan to publish the action plan for any additional suggestions before the final action plan is endorsed and officially published.
The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the development of an action plan for the sustainable use of plant protection products and to the improvement of the capacities of the various actors involved in the plant protection sector. The action plan includes implementation activities in Albania (legal, organizational, technical) aimed at reducing the risks to human or animal health, as well as the environment, arising from the use of pesticides.

26 June 2022
With EU funds, cold chain equipment for COVID19 vaccines has been distributed across Albania. A strong cold chain capacity is important as vaccines must be continuously stored in a limited temperature range – from the time they are manufactured until the moment of vaccination. This is because temperatures that are too high or too low can cause the vaccine to lose its protective power.
During June the last two delivery was made. The first one to Qëndra Shëndetësore Levan, a primary healthcare center outside Fier and the second one to the newly opened primary healthcare center Qendra Shëndetësore nr. 3 in Fier.
The Director of Qëndra Shëndetësore Dr. Luan Beqiraj expressed gratitude for the support saying "Historically, the cold chain capacity in Albania has been very good, and with this contribution, it will continue to improve. This equipment will be very useful for the administration of vaccines in general and for the COVID-19 vaccines."
Dr. Mirgena Hoxhaj, Director of Qendra Shëndetësore nr. 3, also expressed appreciation for the donation saying: "As our healthcare center has been open for less than three months, this donation is coming very timely. Especially as we do not only provide vaccination for the patients within our area, but we also distribute vaccines to 12 smaller health facilities in Fier."
She also expressed appreciation for her colleagues hard work during the COVID-19 pandemic: "Thanks to the great work of the nursing staff in Fier, we have a good uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the area. The nurses have been excellent at informing about the benefits of vaccination and giving the doses. We have even managed to perform vaccination in the homes for people who have difficulties getting to the clinic, such as the elderly population."

Title: World Refugee Day commemorated in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 June 2022
- News from UNHCR Albania
On World Refugee Day, which is celebrated annually on 20 June. This year the core message of the World Refugee Day is that every person has the right to seek safety – whoever they are, wherever they come from, and whenever they are forced to flee.
UNHCR Albania’s Officer in Charge, Ms. Kristina Folkelius gave a statement to the Voice of America.

In her statement, Ms. Folkelius spoke on the current numbers of refugees entering Albania and on how many of them are referred to the asylum procedures. She also reminded the Albanian people on the importance of welcoming refugees into our communities, as it will make the community stronger and more vibrant. The Officer in Charge also spoke on the tragic milestone of 100 million forcibly displaced people around the globe.
As for the situation in Albania, Ms. Folkelius said that “Albania has proven to be a reliable partner on the international scene – demonstrating solidarity and contributing to responsibility sharing – when it comes to offering protection to certain categories of refugees”. She mentioned the Afghan and Ukrainian refugees and commended the Albanian Government’s efforts to help these people. She continued saying “… it remains a fact that other potential refugees and asylum seekers do not have the same effective access to the Albanian territory and the Albanian asylum system”. Ms. Folkelius mentioned that UNHCR remains engaged with the Albanian authorities on the restoration of access to the asylum procedure and supports a sustainable asylum system in Albania.
The activities of world refugee day continued with UNHCR Albania’s partners in Tirana and Gjirokastra.
Refugee and Migrant Services in Albania (RMSA) in partnership with UNHCR and with contribution of Caritas Tirana, organized a get-together for refugees and asylum seekers in the Reception Center for Asylum in Tirana.
The children enjoyed the music and other festivities, while their parents prepared national dishes from their countries of origin.
Caritas Albania with Caritas Austria and UNHCR Albania, continued the successful photography exhibition “The Dreams We Carry” in Gjirokastra.
The ceremony was held in the “Zihni Sako” theater, in the presence of the Prefect of Gjirokastra, the Mayor of Gjirokastra and representatives from local authorities, representatives of religious communities and UNHCR Albania’s Officer in Charge and Gjirokastra Field Unit representative.
In her speech, Ms. Folkelius mentioned “Respecting human rights and refugee rights is not a choice – it is a legal and moral obligation and should never be dependent on nationality or mode of arrival”.

News from the ILO in Albania
The International Labor Organization (ILO), through the project "Access to Justice in Labour Disputes through Mediation and Conciliation", with the financial support of the Government of Sweden, developed a tailor-made training programme on judicial use of International Labour Standards which has become part of the continuous training programme of the Albanian School of Magistrates since 2020. In 2021, the first 50 judges and candidate magistrates (62% women) were trained on international labour standards by the ILO Office for Central and Eastern Europe and the International Training Center of the ILO (ITCILO), in cooperation with the Albanian School of Magistrates.
On 13 -16 June 2022, 55 judges, candidate magistrates and law practitioners (51%women) working in Albanian district and appeal courts were trained and capacitated to use ILS in the domestic case law in areas such as: freedom of association, equality and discrimination, violence and harassment at work, Occupational Safety and Health and Termination of Employment.
The ILS are an important legal source for filling legislative gaps, interpreting ambiguous legal provisions and strengthening domestic case law on labour issues. The training package provides useful resources and a methodology for the initial and continuous education of judges by the School of Magistrates.

Title: Knowledge sharing and exchange of experience between UNCT Montenegro and UNCT Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
03 June 2022
Delivering for SDGs
A bilateral country knowledge sharing event took place between the UN Country Teams (UNCTs) of Montenegro and Albania today. The meeting served to disseminate lessons learned during the implementation of two SDG Funded UN Joint Programmes (one implemented in Albania and the other in Montenegro) and discuss on the wider issue of social protection strengthening and poverty reduction. Also, the event extended the discussion and engaged experts to inform further work and remaining gaps to be tackled in the field.
Albanian and Montenegro share similarities and differences within social protection systems. Coordination between the two countries further supports the process of strengthening social protection systems across the region and ensuring that no one is left behind. Crucially, the European Pillar of Social Rights, in terms of benchmarking the performance of the Western Balkans in relation to its principles, policies, and outcomes, includes a particular focus on the social dimension of enlargement for both countries. While looking forward, the UN will continue to support the governments for the roll-out of the social protection and social inclusion policies and legal frameworks.
“Improving Municipal Social Protection Service Delivery” (IMSPSD) is a UN Albania joint programme focused on catalyzing a step-change in the quantity and quality of delivery at local (municipal) level of integrated social care, as part of an effective integrated social protection system.  It builds upon the vast experience of the UN in addressing social inclusion, protection and the needs of the most vulnerable groups including Roma, refugees and migrants, persons with disabilities, vulnerable children, elderly, rural women, and women at risk of Gender Based Violence. The programme is implemented by UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, UN Women, UNFPA and ILO.

Title: Tiranathlon 2022: UNHCR promotes social inclusion of refugees
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
29 May 2022
#withrefugees
The UNHCR Office in Albania has supported over the past years local sports activities to promote social inclusion of refugees, increase support and solidarity with refugees, and enhance UNHCR’s advocacy for refugee integration. UNHCR’s engagement stems from the principle that sports, particularly endurance sports, offer a positive space to foster inclusiveness. Further, the cause of refugees is relatable to amateur athletes making significant efforts to achieve sports goals and may prompt expressions of solidarity. The participation of refugees and asylum seekers in sports events has been welcomed by all and has shown that inclusion is as simple as enjoying activities together. Some UNHCR staff in Albania, including the Representative, have participated in the events over the years. The involvement of all staff in various roles has also fostered a sense of camaraderie in the office. Partners have been actively involved as well.
In the spirit of “Everyone has the right to seek safety" a Team Refugees (composed of three refugees from Afghanistan) participated in the Tiranathlon 2022, in the second edition of the Tiranathlon. The event was held under the banner of #WithRefugees on 29th  May and was organized by the Tirana Municipality and the Embassy of Greece. UNHCR provided sets composed of bags, t-shirts, and sun caps to all participants.
A key consideration has been to approach sports endurance from the perspective of the amateur athletes, hence offering not only a sense of purpose, but a community space and quality services, including top-quality t-shirts, biking bags and caps, all of which provided the cause of refugees and asylum seekers with a high visibility throughout the years such as with Run4Refugees (2018), 2 Billion Kilometres to Safety (2019) and #WithRefugees (2021) and figuring prominently in social media through videos and photos of the event.
The financial investment against the return (visibility of the refugee cause and advocacy conducted) has been proven beneficial. The sports activities contributed substantially to enhance social media presence and outreach of UNHCR in Albania, notably among public which may not normally follow refugee issues. This target audience in Albania relates with the sports events that are taking place close to them and have direct relation with their interests.

Title: Unique Rodon church opens doors after renovation from UNOPS under EU4Culture project
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
27 May 2022
- The Church bears testimony of a long history, and coupled with natural areas and the coastline, this cultural heritage site has a great potential to contribute to local economic development.
The inauguration ceremony of the St Anthony Church held today on Cape Rodon marks completion of the renovation works conducted earlier this year. The church was damaged by the 2019 earthquake and restored under the EU4Culture programme funded by the European Union and implemented by UNOPS in close cooperation with  the Ministry of Culture of Albania.
St. Anthony’s Church is one of a few surviving examples of a synthesis of regional and Byzantine architectural styles. The Church bears testimony of a long history, and coupled with natural areas and the coastline, this cultural heritage site has a great potential to contribute to local economic development.
The conservation interventions focused on repair and consolidation of the historical masonry, electrical installations and drainage around the church. Conservation works are currently underway on seven cultural heritage assets across Albania, while further  nine are scheduled to start this year. Among them, the Ethnographic museums in Kruja and Kavaja, the Venetian Tower in Durres, the Castle of Bashtova and the Former Archbishopric in Delbnisht. In December 2021, renovation works have been completed at the Monastery Church of Rubik.
The inauguration ceremony was attended by Elva Margariti, Minister of Culture of Albania, Alexis Hupin, EU Delegation to Albania Chargé d’affaires, Ambassador of Germany Peter Zingraf,  Church representative, frat Landi Jaku and Pamela Lama, UNOPS in Albania  Country Manager. It was followed by a concert by a prize-winning Albanian Opera singer Marjana Leka and pianist Laura Lila.
“We are happy to celebrate the inauguration of this church which connects together the  sacredness, the legend, and community under culture. The work we are celebrating today has been very delicate and brought together engineers, historians, a team of the Ministry of Culture and UNOPS and many experts. This has not only been a restoration but a revitalisation as well, it has gone with our comom philosophy after the earthquake ‘Build back better’ ” noted Elva Margariti, Minister of Culture of Albania.
“St Anthony church is just one of many irreplaceable cultural landmarks of Albania that the EU is helping restore and revitalise under the EU4Culture programme, in order to stimulate local economic development. EU4Culture is the biggest and most ambitious cultural heritage programme ever undertaken by the EU in the Western Balkans, and it shows the solidarity and great priority that the EU and Team Europe gives to Albania,” underlined Alexis Hupin, EU Delegation to Albania Chargé d’affaires.
“I think this is a very good example of using funds to save cultural monuments  that are endangered. I am very proud that this was possible some 20 years ago. I don’t know if I can speak about the European Union but I can speak about Team Europe. So I can only repeat ‘Evropa eshte ketu’, and this means that this cooperation over many years, and this project that saved the church, that made it beautiful again is a good example of the coordination and cooperation we do together here in our partner country Albania.”  noted Peter Zingraf, Ambassador of Germany to Albania.
“For UNOPS  it is a great honor  to be a trusted partner of the European Union and the Government of Albania in implementing such an important initiative. In coordination with the Ministry of Culture and the EU we are currently conducting conservation works on seven cultural heritage assets, and we will start works, finalize procurement or design processes  on nine more sites in the near future” noted Pamela Lama, UNOPS in Albania  Country Manager.

Title: New learning module on prevention and resolution of disputes at work taught to more than 2000 general high school students
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
27 May 2022
News from the ILO
The International Labor Organization (ILO), through the project "Access to Justice in Labour Disputes through Mediation and Conciliation", implemented in Albania with the financial support of the Government of Sweden, developed and introduced in cooperation with the Quality Assurance Agency of Pre-University Education an optional learning module on prevention and resolution of disputes at work for general high school students. The new optional learning module was introduced to the official curricula of pre-university education in 2021. It aims to educate and build the capacities of students with skills in the field of prevention and effective resolution of disputes through negotiation and dialogue. Through this module general high school students are involved in practical activities that develop and build their capacities and skills to understand, prevent and resolve peacefully and effectively labour disputes and problems in their future workplaces (as employers or employees).
During 2021-2022 school year, the new module was delivered to 2040 general high school students in Tirana, Korça, Pogradec, Librazhd,  Elbasan, Durres, Lushnje, Kurbin and Kamëz. More than 400 general high school teachers from 11 Local Education Offices were trained in cascade on the implementation of the new module and use of teachers’ manual.
On 27 May 2022, the ILO and ASCAP trained another group of 40 teachers and local education offices representatives (70% women) from other 20 local education offices so that the implementation of the module is expanded during the 2022-2023 school year to other districts.

Title: WHO: Let's speak up for mental health
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 May 2022
One in six people globally are aged 10-19 years. Adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems. Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood.
Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 7 (14%) 10–19-year-olds experience mental health conditions, yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated. Adolescents with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to seek help), educational difficulties, risk-taking behaviours, physical ill-health and human rights violations.
The European Mental Health Week on the 9-13th of May is an initiative that aims to raise awareness about the importance of mental health in our everyday lives. In most European countries, mental health problems among young people have increased in the last two years as a consequence of the pandemic. Immediate action at the European and national levels is crucial to address the mental health needs of young people.
In light of European Mental Health week, Dr. Neli Demi, WHO mental health expert, partook in an event organized by the foundation Together Albania where students from Tirana University got the opportunity to listen and ask questions to experts within the field. During his speech, Dr. Demi highlighted that mental health is a priority for the WHO European region.
During the past two years, WHO has supported the Albanian Ministry of Health and Social Protection with capacity-building activities to strengthen mental health support during emergencies. In addition, the WHO is currently supporting a youth-led awareness-raising campaign together with UNYD and UNICEF, coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator Office in Albania.

Title: UNOPS and EU4Culture: Albanian Museums Reimagined
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
18 May 2022
- News from UNOPS in Albania
There are approximately 104,000 museums in the world and about 53 of them are in Albania. Museums are instrumental for fostering cultural exchange and enrichment as well as for promoting mutual understanding, cooperation and peace.
Minister of Culture Elva Margariti together with the Deputy Head of the Political Section of the EU Delegation to Albania, Jean-Baptiste Le Bras, visited Kavaja to monitor the works at the Ethnographic Museum, an important cultural heritage site which is currently being restored under the EU4Culture programme, funded by the European Union and implemented by UNOPS, in close cooperation with the Ministry of Culture.
Currently, the Ethnographic Museum in Kruja and Kavaja are being restored under the EUCulture programme and the works at the Archaeological Museum in Durres are about to start. In parallel, the project experts are working closely with the Ministry of Culture to repair the iconic facade Mosaic and developing a new design for the  National Historical Museum in Tirana.
Working with Museums which were damaged by earthquakes is a complicated operation, requiring skill and involvement of diverse expertise, including museum specialists, artifact and material conservators, interpretation specialists, conservation architects, civil, mechanical and electrical engineers.
Once the conservation design is finalized, all the artifacts need to be secured. The objects will be to be taken off displays, cleaned, packed and then stored while taking into account the type, size, condition and the material artifact is made from. Once all the artifacts are securely stored, the physical conservation works can commence. While conservation works are ongoing, the inventories of all the artifacts are checked.
Every artifact is a valuable object per se, however when they are brought together in a meaningful and well-thought way they can tell a story and make history live. Sometimes, the storytelling power has nothing to do with the value, age, or beauty of an object. Instead, it is about making an emotional connection by displaying an object that crossed both time and space to appear before you. Exposure to an artifact brings the visitor closer to the past in a way that words alone often cannot do. Hence, the artifacts have to be selected and the way they would be exposed is carefully designed. Reconceptualization of the exposition line will aim the narrative to become more clear, comprehensive and appealing to the visitors of all ages.
There are a number of ways EU4Culture is planning to conduct storytelling and interpretation in museums under restoration. The project plans to develop and install both digital and classical interpretation. The digital will include all aspects of digital reconstruction and narrative of social and cultural context of life lived in these buildings, while the classical one would be exposing these contexts through written words and museum labels.
Besides digital narrative and interpretation of historical facts, EU4Culture will be focusing on additional elements of storytelling including immersive and augmented realities based on historical facts and to be experienced in nowadays museums. Exciting times ahead!

WHO Albania run a dedicated three-day meeting on the quality of care and patient safety in the post-COVID19 era in Albania. WHO experts from the European region got together with national experts to discuss challenges and opportunities for strengthening the healthcare system in Albania including:
• Innovative and good practices
• Partnership
• Healthcare workers perspective
• COVID19 response and quality of care
• National plans and initiatives

WHO Representative Ms. Geraldine McWeeney held the opening remarks together with Dr. Joao Breeda, Head of Athens WHO European Centre of Excellence for Quality in Care and Patient Safety, and Prof. Mira Rakacolli, Deputy Minister of Health and Social Protection. During the week, the participants also got the opportunity to visit a primary healthcare center in Tirana and University Hospital Center "Mother Theresa" and talk directly to the healthcare professionals in the field.
WHO is committed to continuing the support for collaboration amongst sister agencies across Europe to ensure quality and patient safety, as well as learn from each other's best practices! #StrongerTogether

What is Patient Safety?
Patient Safety is a health care discipline that emerged with the evolving complexity in health care systems and the resulting rise of patient harm in health care facilities. It aims to prevent and reduce risks, errors and harm that occur to patients during provision of health care. A cornerstone of the discipline is continuous improvement based on learning from errors and adverse events.
Patient safety is fundamental to delivering quality essential health services. Indeed, there is a clear consensus that quality health services across the world should be effective, safe and people-centred. In addition, to realize the benefits of quality health care, health services must be timely, equitable, integrated and efficient.
To ensure successful implementation of patient safety strategies; clear policies, leadership capacity, data to drive safety improvements, skilled health care professionals and effective involvement of patients in their care, are all needed.
What is quality of care?
Quality of care is the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes. It is based on evidence-based professional knowledge and is critical for achieving universal health coverage. As countries commit to achieving Health for All, it is imperative to carefully consider the quality of care and health services.  Quality health care can be defined in many ways but there is growing acknowledgement that quality health services should be:

Title: Tirana hosts Europe’s first workshop on lessons learned in RCCE from the COVID-19 response
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
09 May 2022
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown, perhaps as never before, the importance of risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) for emergency preparedness and response. Communicating the risks from the virus has proven vital to ensuring people can make informed decisions and take actions to protect themselves and others, and has thus helped reduce the pandemic’s impact on health systems and economies.
The involvement of communities in COVID-19 responses, which has led to greater acceptance and uptake of vaccines and other protective measures, has also helped build trust in authorities.
The success of response measures to health emergencies is therefore highly dependent on effective RCCE. This was the starting point of Europe’s first workshop on lessons learned in RCCE from the COVID-19 response. The event brought together 25 participants from the Western Balkans and the Republic of Moldova in Tirana, Albania.
Taking stock of the lessons learned across the WHO European Region as well as in individual countries, participants developed suggestions for their subregion to improve the effectiveness of RCCE interventions for the future.
The workshop came at a timely moment, as a plateau in vaccination rates in the Western Balkans signals the need to prepare effective RCCE responses now to boost vaccine uptake in advance of a likely uptick of COVID-19 cases in autumn.
In her address to workshop participants, Dr Mira Rakacolli, Deputy Minister of Health and Social Protection of Albania, stressed, “Communicating about the risks is not always easy, especially when the science behind them is complex and constantly evolving.” She added that, more than any previous emergency, “This pandemic has shown that health authorities need the trust and support of the communities they serve if they are to stop an epidemic.”
Dr Rakacolli noted that the lessons identified and the actions proposed for the subregion will be highly important: “High-quality risk communication and community engagement by health authorities are crucial for gaining their trust and support.”
Ms Geraldine McWeeney, WHO Representative to Albania, added that the mutual learning and partnership gained through RCCE can benefit the entire Region: “This technical workshop, and others like it, pool knowledge and expertise, identify common challenges, and then lead to united action with support from WHO and international partners – resulting in better health for all our communities.”
Dr Abebayehu Assefa Mengistu, Coordinator of the WHO Health Emergencies Balkan Hub, pointed out that all of our key disease control strategies, from case finding and contact tracing to preventive measures such as face masks, distancing and vaccination, depend on trust and support from communities. “Now is the time to take stock of the immense learning from COVID-19 and not let it go, but instead translate it into stronger health systems for future epidemics and emergencies.”
Ms Cristiana Salvi, RCCE Adviser for WHO/Europe, explained, “With this meeting, we wanted to establish a role model that brings RCCE to the next level as a core public health intervention in the response to both outbreak and humanitarian emergencies. The health sector can rise to this task by putting in place the right structures, systems and skills for when the next emergency strikes.”
Ms Salvi added, “The lessons identified in this event will be relevant not only for the Western Balkans region, but to everyone working in health emergency responses across Europe and the world.”
Dr Audra Diers-Lawson, Associate Professor at Kristiania University College in Norway and Editor of the Journal of International Crisis and Risk Communication Research, said, “There is a growing body of social science evidence from this pandemic and previous health emergencies on the factors that influence whether people will accept or reject advice on how to protect themselves. The data shows that 3 factors are key: whether they believe the risk is both imminent and severe, whether they think the institution giving the advice is technically competent, and whether they trust the institution giving the advice.”
Dr Diers-Lawson continued, “Tracking and analysing communities’ perceptions of the risk and attitudes about institutions are key to designing a good communication strategy. The tricky bit is how to do this in a way that is rapid and practical enough to give evidence for action by health response teams.”
The workshop emphasized the need for intersectoral cooperation, collaboration and information sharing, and showed how subregional and regional exchange of best practices and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic can help strengthen countries’ RCCE capacity before, during and after public health emergencies.
The suggestions for improving RCCE capacity developed as a result of this workshop will include actions to be taken by Member States of the European Region and by WHO itself. Participants from the workshop will also be advising their health authorities to use the recommendations in developing country- and area-specific RCCE action plans.
WHO is committed to providing further support to countries to implement these recommendations, which are in line with the Roadmap for Health and Well-being in the Western Balkans (‎2021–2025)‎ and the European Programme of Work 2020–2025‎ – “United Action for Better Health in Europe”.

04 May 2022
News from UNIDO in Albania
UNIDO launched today the Global Quality and Standards Programme (GQSP) Albania together with the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development of Albania and the Embassy of Switzerland in the country. It paves the way for a €1.84 million project funded by Switzerland through the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), which aims to support the Albania’s efforts to strengthen quality and standards compliance capacity and improve market access in the medicinal and aromatic plants and the fruit and vegetable sectors.

Frida Krifca, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, signed the project document and highlighted that “the agreement is one of the most important ones I sign in my capacity as Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, due to its focus on complying with standards and enhancing quality across value chains for two of the most important export products of our country, medicinal and aromatic plants as well as fruits vegetables”.

“Enterprises in Albania need to comply with international and European standards to increase their productivity and competitiveness. This is a necessary step to increase efficiency and boost market access. It also helps to improve working conditions”, said Adrian Maître, Ambassador of Switzerland in Albania, at the signing ceremony.


The project “Strengthening Quality and Standards Compliance Capacity for Selected Value Chains in Albania” is part of the Global Quality and Standards Programme (GQSP), an innovative approach jointly developed by UNIDO and Switzerland to strengthen the quality and standards compliance capacity in selected value chains of partner countries to facilitate market access for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).


The project aims to enhance the quality compliance capability of both value chains and strengthen the service capacity of quality infrastructure (QI) system in Albania - primarily in terms of pesticide and bacterial contamination - in order to reduce border rejections in key markets and to improve both quality and productivity in these value chains.

The project will also address cross-cutting issues including promoting a culture for quality along the value chains for sustainable development. It will be implemented in close collaboration with various partners including the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, QI institutions, food safety authorities, Albanian Investment Development Agency (AIDA), along with leading associations and academia.

World Press Freedom Day was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 1993.
Independent, free and pluralistic media are central to good governance and the rule of law. They contribute to ensure transparency and accountability, promote participation in public and political discourse, and foster democratic processes.
3 May acts as a reminder to governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom. As highlighted by the UN Secretary General, on World Press Freedom Day “we shine a spotlight on the essential work of journalists and other media workers who seek transparency and accountability from those in power, often at great personal risk. (…) Without freedom of the press, there are no real democratic societies. Without freedom of the press, there is no freedom.”
This year’s World Press Freedom Day, under the theme “Journalism under digital siege”, spotlights the multiple ways in which journalism is endangered by surveillance and digitally-mediated attacks on journalists, and the consequences on public trust in digital communications. The digital era has created a fast-evolving environment that while on the one hand has democratized access to information and increased exchanges across borders, on the other it has impacted on the right to privacy and in many circumstances put media workers and their sources at greater risk of being targeted, harassed and attacked – for instance, due to data retention, spyware and digital surveillance.
“Amid growing threats to our common security and a global pandemic, we depend more than ever on independent, fact-based and reliable journalism as a compass to navigate the ocean of information, misinformation, disinformation, fake news and propaganda. Worldwide, this day serves as a reminder to governments and leaders of the need to respect press freedom. It is also an opportunity for media professionals to reflect on professional ethics”, commented Ambassador Del Monaco.
On this World Press Freedom Day, the OSCE Presence in Albania and the United Nations in Albania wish to honour the essential work of media professionals and journalists. We remain committed to the cause of media freedom in the country as indispensable for building strong, resilient institutions and societies.
In the context of Albania, we would like to reiterate the importance of the following messages:

Title: Refrigerated vehicles to support Albania’s cold chain capacity
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 April 2022
Covid-19 Response
Delivering vaccines to all corners of the world is a complex task. It takes a chain of precisely coordinated events in temperature-controlled environments to store, manage and transport these life-saving products. This is called a cold chain.
Vaccines must be continuously stored in a limited temperature range – from the time they are manufactured until the moment of vaccination. This is because temperatures that are too high or too low can cause the vaccine to lose its protective power.
WHO has supported Albania's cold chain capacity with two refrigerated vehicles, 102 refrigerators for the storage of vaccines and three cold rooms installed in Tirana, Durres, and Fier. WHO supports #healthcare facilities to provide quality and safe health services.

Title: 18 public labour disputes public mediators and conciliators certified on labour dispute mediation/conciliation skills by ITCILO
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
22 April 2022
News from the ILO in Albania
More than 15,000 labour disputes were filed in the civil courts during 2015-2020. Settled mainly through civil courts, labour disputes have caused excessive workload on the Albanian courts, with many cases still pending examination for a long time now, and inflicting high costs to the disputing parties.
The International Labor Organization (ILO), through the project "Access to Justice in Labour Disputes through Mediation and Conciliation", with the financial support of the Government of Sweden, has developed a tailor-made training and certification programme on mediation/conciliation of labour disputes for Albanian public mediators and conciliators.  The training programme was developed jointly by international and national experts and aims to equip public mediators and conciliators with sound knowledge and practical skills of consensus-building and conflict management to help workers and employers in Albania to peacefully resolve labour disputes.
Throughout 2021-2022, the ILO through its international training center (ITCILO) has trained 80 mediators, conciliators and labour administration employees that deal with labour disputes from the 12 districts of the country. Participants were equipped with knowledge and professional skills to conduct mediation and conciliation procedures for labour disputes.
On 19-22 April 2022, the ILO Office for Central and Eastern Europe and the International Training Center of the ILO (ITCILO), in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and Economy, started the second round of training courses for mediators and conciliators of labour disputes. 34 public and private mediators, members of tripartite state conciliation offices (public conciliators) and other labour administration employees handling labour disputes (56% women) were trained on mediation/conciliation skills.
Ms. Andrea Franconi, ITCILO trainer, said: “The role of conciliators/mediators is crucial for developing effective dispute resolution systems. If conciliators/mediators are properly trained in conflict management and negotiation processes, they can contribute to developing strong and sound labour and industrial relations in Albania”.
The training package will be transferred to the Ministry of Finance and Economy, to train the Albanian public structures of mediation and conciliation of labour disputes. Ms Dorina Nika, ILO Project Coordinator said: “Through these specialized training courses and tools, we aim to develop among public mediators and conciliators sound knowledge and practical skills of consensus-building and conflict management so that they are better equipped to help disputing parties in reaching consensual agreements and resolve collective disputes. In addition, we aim to equip the Ministry responsible for labour with specialized training tools so that they can continue to train the public mediators/conciliators in the future”.
The first 15 public mediators and 3 members of the National Conciliation Office (representatives of trade unions and employers’ organization) were certified by the ITCILO on 19 April 2022 after successful accomplishment of a series of training, coaching and rigorous assessment by international experts. The certification ceremony was organized with the participation of Mr Albin Gega, Director of Employment Policies and Vocational Training, in the Ministry of Finance and Economy, Mr Klevis Hysa, Director General of the National Employment Agency for Employment and Skills, Ms. Andrea Isabel Franconi (ITCILO Officer), and Mrs. Zhulieta Harasani, ILO National Coordinator for Albania. They congratulated and handed over the Certificates of Achievement to the first group of mediators and members of the National Conciliation Office that successfully completed the 2021 courses.
The project “Access to Justice in Labour Disputes through Mediation and Conciliation” is implemented in Albania by the ILO, with the financial support of the Government of Sweden. The project aims to improve access to justice for all, including vulnerable groups of workers through peaceful settlement of labour disputes, collective bargaining and collective agreements, and the creation of informed policies on amicable settlements of labour disputes.

Title: 2 years of COVID-19 response in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
15 April 2022
Covid-19 Response
Two years have passed since Albania reported its first COVID-19 case in early March 2020.  Since then, Albania has reported over 272.000 infections and almost 3500 deaths. On March 9, Ms. Ogerta Manastirliu Minister of Health and Social Protection brought together various actors to acknowledge their role in the COVID-19 response in Albania.
WHO representative Geraldine McWeeney gave a speech recognizing the work accomplished so far. "While we mourn these souls that are no longer with us, we also celebrate the development and distribution of safe and effective vaccines in record time. Almost 3 million doses have been administered here in Albania, saving many lives.”
Ms. McWeeney also recognized the immense work of the Ministry and the sacrifices made by the people of Albania. "Not least its dedicated health workers who have shouldered the weight of this crisis, putting themselves in harm’s way in the service of their patients".
Lastly, Ms. McWeeney concluded “Even though we have come a long way over the last 2 years, the virus remains unpredictable, highly contagious, and life-threatening in unvaccinated populations. As the restrictions are gradually removed and as numbers are decreasing, here in Albania we need to remember that individually you have a choice to take measures to protect yourselves and those around you. In due course, COVID-19 might become endemic, and I am hopeful that in Albania we can end the emergency phase of this pandemic in 2022, but only if everyone pulls together – politicians, people, and scientists across the world".

12 April 2022
Covid-19 Response
As a part of the COVID-19 emergency response project, UNOPS in Albania commenced renovation works at the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) within the Mother Teresa Hospital in Tirana. The works, worth EUR 5.61 million, will transform the IDC into a state-of-the-art modern clinic, serving more than 10,000 patients annually.
Working closely with the doctors, nurses, engineers and medical experts, UNOPS in Albania developed a comprehensive design that ensured that professional health services are provided, and the clinic premises become more accessible to all the people, in particular those with special needs. After renovation, the clinic will have 16 emergency beds, 8 Intensive Care Units (ICU) and 87 ward beds that improve life-saving medical services to the people in need. All the beds will have access to the medical air and oxygen. In order to minimize the risk of spreading the airborne infections at the hospital, rooms are pressurized, and high-tech air filtration systems will be installed in line with the international standards.
“This investment will contribute to our efforts on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigating its impact. This clinic will set an example for the entire country on how to organize response to a health crisis”- noted Ogerta Manastirliu, the Minister of Health of Albania, inaugurating the renovation works at the Clinic.
“We are proud to work alongside our partners from the Ministry of Health and the World Bank to provide world-class equipment and technical expertise that will strengthen the capacity of the Albanian healthcare professionals. As a result of the works, both medical staff and patients will benefit from the renovated and improved facilities and thousands of people will have access to high-quality healthcare” - noted Pamela Lama, Country Manager of the UNOPS in Albania.

News from UNODC
6 April 2022, Belgrade, Serbia: The UNODC Global Firearms Programme (GFP) held a regional meeting on harmonization of the criminal legislation with the UN Firearms Protocol in the Western Balkans attended by representatives of the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Ministry of Interior and Prosecutor’s Office from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.
UNODC GFP presented and discussed a comparative legislative analysis of the domestic criminal legislations with the MoJ representatives and criminal justice practitioners, which was followed by further discussions on the current status of harmonization of the criminal legislation with the UN Firearms Protocol, based on UNODC GFP recommendations. As a result, the exchange of experiences was facilitated and the needs for the provision of further technical assistance by UNODC GFP were identified.
The role of the UN Firearms Protocol and UNTOC is vital for the process of harmonization of the criminal legislation as well as in bringing countries together to counter firearms trafficking and organized crime. The attending jurisdictions expressed commitment in this regard and discussed the need for establishing a dedicated platform in the Western Balkans where criminal justice practitioners could gather to collectively address issues related to criminal legislation and practice.
This activity is implemented with the financial support provided by Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, and Norway through the Western Balkans SALW Control Roadmap Trust Fund and supported by the European Union.

The meeting hosted representatives of the Ministry of Justice, Financial Intelligence Unit, General Prosecutor’s Office, State Police – Economic Crime Branch, Special Anti-Corruption Structure (SPAK), and– Asset Management Agency (AAPSK). During the meeting, UNODC provided an overview of the objectives of the regional initiative related to asset recovery processes and shared plans for the development of an Asset Recovery Roadmap for Albania, mapping out the priorities for the jurisdiction. Similarly, the counterparts provided insights on the current state of play in Albania and discussed in depth their needs to establish and position the future Asset Recovery Office, together with the subsequent legal amendments and requirements as well as operational and capacity building needs for the practitioners.
As a result of these comprehensive consultations, a draft Asset Recovery Roadmap for Albania was created, and will further be discussed and consulted upon with stakeholders prior to finalization.

Title: UN Albania to support the process of drafting Albania's first Integrated National Financing Framework
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
31 March 2022
-Supported by the Joint SDG Fund
UN Albania run the  kick-off meeting for the process of drafting the first Integrated National Financing Framework. It aims to inform national and international partners of the building blocks of the drafting process, outlining the linkages between INFF and other national policy documents, and the efforts needed for governing and coordinating the process.
Albania is strongly committed to the 2030 Agenda but faces challenges in meeting sustainable development targets. At times, efforts to estimate the costs for meeting the 2030 Agenda have been imperfect. Led by UNDP and jointly implemented with UNICEF, ILO, UN Women and UNFPA, it is part of the Programme 'Strategic Policy Options for SDG Financing', funded by Joint SDG Fund.
Working in partnership with the Government of Albania, the Programme seeks to expand the institutional capacities at the national and local level for developing feasible solutions and identifying fiscal space to progressively increase SDG-related spending in Albania and integrate these in the national budgetary framework.
One of the key programme components is the development of the first Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) for Albania. The INFF is a new planning and delivery tool for financing sustainable development at the national level.  The INFF serves to map the full range of financing sources – public and private, domestic and international – as well as the non-financial means of implementation that are available, thus laying out a financing strategy for raising resources, managing risks, and achieving sustainable development priorities.

Title: Expanding Choices - Champion Companies on Family Friendly Policies together in an annual planning meeting

29 March 2022
News from UNFPA Albania
Ensuring a sustainable balance between life and work is a multi-sectoral collective effort that requires long-term commitment from all stakeholders. The project implemented by UNFPA in Albania aims to expand the spectrum of choices for women, in order for them to fulfill their career aspirations and to create families, have children, but also to include men in family care, unpaid work at home and beyond, thus contributing to gender equality.
Following the signing of seven cooperation agreements with the champion companies Agna Group, Sallameri FIX, INCA Albania, LUFRA, Raiffeisen Bank, R&T Group and the Women's Chamber of Commerce, an annual meeting was organized to discuss, plan and agree on strategies and plans common and specific for 2022 and beyond. This annual meeting was a good opportunity to exchange challenges and successful approaches in addressing issues related to more family-friendly work environments.
The agreements confirm the commitment of these companies to implement more family-friendly policies. According to the agreements, this will be achieved through consultative sessions and training activities for the management and human resources departments, and the department of communication, exchange of knowledge and experience with successful implementers in the region, that will be facilitated and technically and financially supported by this project. All of these efforts will also be accompanied by a simultaneous collaboration with national legislators to develop a more complete gender-responsive family policy framework.
These interventions are part of the activities and objectives of the regional project "Expanding Choices: Gender Responsive Family Policies for the Private Sector in the Western Balkans and Moldova" implemented by UNFPA and financially supported by the Austrian Development Agency.

Title: Addressing the greatest development challenge of our time
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
07 March 2022
OpEd by
Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator
Luigi Soreca, EU Ambassador to Albania
Globally, it has been recognized that gender inequality, coupled with climate change and environmental crisis, is one of the greatest sustainable development challenges of our time. Violent conflict dramatically adds to that challenge, as we are seeing these days in Ukraine, with thousands of women forced to leave everything behind, fleeing the insanity of war.
And yet, while we know well the disproportionate price women pay in times of war, there is a wide spread assumption that climate change is “gender neutral”, and we continue to witness low engagement of women in decision making. But, the global climate crisis is not “gender neutral”. Women and girls’ rights, priorities and needs are systematically overlooked by climate, environmental, and disaster risk policies and programmes. Their survival rates are lower in disasters, their access to relief decreases, and gender-based violence grows, at home, at work, and in public spaces – as revealed by the shadow pandemic during the COVID-19 crisis.
This year’s theme for International Women’s Day “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow” provides an opportunity to celebrate the women and girls around the world who are at the forefront of climate change and environmental justice. It also forces all of us to double down on achieving substantive equality between men and women across all sectors of Albania’s society.
The lingering effects of the 2019 earthquake are placing women economic empowerment at risk of stagnation, because women are often involved in traditional, unpaid or low-paid jobs. Deeply rooted challenges in accessing land and other productive assets exacerbate gender economic inequalities.
The UN family and the EU are working closely together to support the communities most heavily affected by the earthquake and ensure a successful and sustainable recovery for all.
Without a doubt, as part of its EU accession agenda, Albania made considerable progress to align its legal framework on climate change and gender equality to the EU acquis and international standards. Key strategies were developed to address environmental and climate change challenges. The new National Strategy for Gender Equality for Albania includes - for the first time - a strong emphasis on emergencies and disaster risk prevention, while national commitments on climate change feature references to gender equality. And in just few days, the country will participate in the UN Commission on the Status of Women that will specifically review global progress on expanding women’s agency on climate, environmental and disaster risk reduction.

Studies show that natural disasters mostly affect economies dependent on agricultural production. In Albania, agriculture accounts for 18% of GDP, employing 40% of the workforce. Because Albanian women mostly work the land informally or without pay, they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Albania needs to make gender equality and the empowerment of women a lived reality of its environmental and climate-related action. To do that, it needs to boost capacities at national and local levels, step up coordination across institutions and partners, and strengthen sex-disaggregated data to measure the differential impact of climate change and disaster. It also requires bold steps to overcome gender stereotypes that limit women participation in innovation, digitalization and the green economy.
Women and girls from around the world are driving climate action. Their voices must be amplified and carefully listened to, also in Albania. We need to strengthen their skills to build resilience in the face of climate change and disaster, supporting their meaningful participation and involvement as decision makers.
On International Women’s Day, let us not forget women and girls who are raising their voices. Echoing the words of Albanian environmental justice activist Rea Nepravishta ‘We hope to see women and men, boys and girls working hand-in-hand to create a world based on care for each other and for the earth, rather than exploitation. This is, we believe, the door to a better future.’

2-3 March 2022, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina: UNODC in collaboration with the National Coordinator for Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and Illegal Migration of Bosnia and Herzegovina and with support and funding from the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs in France organized a regional expert group meeting (REGM) on financial investigations and asset recovery for trafficking in persons, including compensation on victims in South Eastern Europe.
The purpose of the REGM was to advance the discussion on trends and patterns of human trafficking in South Eastern Europe and to identify and analyze challenges related to financial investigations, asset recovery, including for compensation of victims, in human trafficking cases, particularly with a cross-border element.
Additionally, the event served as a platform to discuss the international obligations, conceptual approaches and policy responses to human trafficking and to exchange on good practices and challenges to address it.
Over 50 of criminal justice practitioners from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Kosovo under UNSCR 1244 took part in the meeting along with representatives from regional and international organizations, CSOs, private sector and academia.
Accordingly, the role and perspectives of financial investigations, illicit financial flows and asset recovery in cross-border combating of human trafficking and organized crime were presented and illustrated with examples of good practices and challenges in these areas. The participating international organizations and CSOs shared their perspectives on these topics.
As a result of the meeting, a set of concrete actions was provided for future engagement at the regional/sub-regional or bilateral level, including with international organizations, to tackle the issue of human trafficking.

UN Resident Coordinator in Albania Fiona McCluney and Vodafone Albania CEO Katia Stathaki sign cooperation agreement
UN Resident Coordinator Fiona McCluney and Vodafone Albania CEO Katia Stathaki have signed a cooperation agreement that supports Albania’s drive to attain the Sustainable Development Goals.
The ‘Joint Declaration of Intent concerning cooperation in meeting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Albania’ projects a strategic partnership focusing on some of the most pressing issues that need to be addressed globally, from poverty, climate, environmental protection, health and gender-based violence.

The United Nations in Albania works with the country’s Government and a wide range of development partners, including the private sector, to maximize support and accelerate the implementation of Albania's commitments to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which were adopted by the international community in 2015.
Speaking to the media during the signing event, Ms. McCluney underlined the important role that cooperation with the private sector has, especially in the face of the challenges posed by the pandemic.
“We are living in extraordinary times and the Covid-19 pandemic is teaching us that global challenges can be tackled and overcome only through coordinated action. Business is a vital partner of the UN in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which explicitly call on and present an opportunity for the private sector to apply their creativity, innovation, and financing to address the biggest sustainable development challenges," Ms. McCluney said.
Ms. Stathaki expressed optimism for the role that technology can play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and in the fight against the major problems that the world, including Albania, faces today.
“On behalf of Vodafone Albania, I want to express my pride that we are signing this agreement with the United Nations in Albania today. Technology can help reduce inequalities by providing access to basic services, such as e-health or online education. It can also be used by governments to network citizens through e-government tools and improve stakeholder engagement and information management. We truly believe that Vodafone technology can be made available to Albanian citizens to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals together," Ms. Stathaki said.
As part of the agreement, Vodafone Albania commits to providing technology and Internet of Things (IoT) products to assist UN agencies in Albania in delivering sustainable development. In the words of Vodafone representatives, this commitment adds to investments that the company has undertaken in campaigns and initiatives with social impact, from the environment and the economy, to efforts to halt violence against women.

Title: UNODC initiates a new project on addressing trafficking in persons in South Eastern Europe
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 November 2021
News from UNODC
October/November 2021, North Macedonia, Serbia: UNODC has completed the formation of the new team in the region who will support the UNODC efforts in the area of criminal justice response on countering trafficking in persons in South Eastern Europe. Accordingly, two National Project Officers and a Project Assistant have now joined UNODC in North Macedonia and Serbia and will also be covering UNODC's cooperation on this topic with Albania and Montenegro.
More specifically, the project team will support the implementation of the new project "UN.Locking Impunity of Traffickers and Supporting Justice for Victims of Trafficking in Persons in Southeastern Europe" (2021-2024). The project is in line with UNODC's overall objectives set out in the UNODC Regional Programme for South Eastern Europe, which aim to reduce transnational organized crime and related threats, enhance security and promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The project aims to accurately identify the gaps and weaknesses in the response to trafficking in persons at the national and regional levels through partnership and continuous interaction with the government, the judiciary, civil society, academia, regional/international organizations and other relevant expert practitioners, and to develop and provide sustainable and targeted capacity building support to relevant stakeholders.
Within the project, UNODC will conduct national reviews and analysis of recent trafficking cases to identify factors and vulnerabilities that contributed to inadequate investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cases. Based on findings, UNODC will develop thematic recommendations and training plans to foster victim-centered and trauma-informed investigations and prosecutions in each country. In addition, UNODC will support the addressed countries with multidisciplinary national and regional trainings and workshops for investigators, prosecutors and other stakeholders, and will develop and adopt a regional mentoring plan with Belgium and France as mentor countries.
The project is implemented by the UNODC Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling Section (HTMSS) in cooperation with the UNODC Regional Programme for South Eastern Europe and with the financial support of the U.S. Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/ TIP).

26 November 2021
Today it is two years since Albania’s earthquake, claiming the lives of 51 people, leaving over 1000 injured and 17 thousand buildings damaged. Today, all of us at UN Albania remember those who lost their lives and express deep gratitude for the solidarity and support that followed.
We thank all first-aid workers who rushed to the wrecked buildings to save lives and help the survivors. We thank our development partners, institutions, private sector and individuals who offered their support for the people who lost their homes, their schools and their businesses.
Earthquake Response by UN Albania:
The UN were fast to intervene to rescue people, deploying a UN Disaster Assistance Coordination team from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs working with the EU-led Civil Protection Team.
WHO experts conducted a rapid needs assessment for field hospitals to ensure continuity of health services, provided life-saving risk communication and necessary supplies.
UNICEF, UNDP, UNHCR, UNFPA and UN Women through their joint and agency ongoing work were on the ground to provide urgent core relief items.
In the immediate aftermath, more than 200 frontline professionals were engaged by UNICEF to provide psychosocial counselling and support to over 3500 children and adult family members residing in temporary shelters.
UNDP mobilized staff and volunteers to assess the situation of people affected to generate data that government and international development partners used to prioritize assistance. This information fed into the Post Disaster Need Assessment (PDNA) presented at the “Together for Albania Donor Conference” raising valuable funds for reconstruction efforts.

The UN in Albania is a proud partner on earthquake recovery, with interventions of over EUR 126 million Euros designed to rebuild the communities affected in areas of education, economic recovery and resilience, community infrastructure, social protection, child protection and gender equality: 115 million Euro funding by the EU to recover damages from the earthquake on schools and cultural sites and 11.65 million Euro from the governments of Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and the UK as a contribution to the Albania SDG Acceleration Fund to support national earthquake efforts.
Under #EU4Schools programme, UNDP is constructing 63 education facilities, benefiting 24.529 pupils and teachers in 11 most affected municipalities. An additional school and kindergarten facility will be built with under with financial support Government of Croatia. Combing the Build Back Better with Build Back Together Approaches, 17 education facilities have already been completed.

UNOPS is working with EU under the #EU4Culture programe to restore and revitalize earthquake-affected cultural heritage sites in Albania with a focus on making culture a driver for local social and economic development and boosting tourism.
To date, one of the targeted sites (The Monastery Church of Rubik) has been restored and work is ongoing on 3 other sites. By the end of 2021, implementation will start on 4 additional sites leading to a total of 8 sites with works either completed or under implementation.

Through UNDP, we are supporting Albanian Government to strengthen the strategic and operational framework for Disaster Risk Management and build capacities at central and local; strengthening the competitiveness and resilience capacities of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME-s), support Albanian institutions with innovative tools and promote employment as part of the Economic Recovery and Resilience Programme.
Through UN Women, we are working to strengthen women’s resilience and building institutional capacities in all 11 earthquake affected municipalities, so women can benefit from better protection from gender-based violence during emergencies.
In agriculture sector, FAO is supporting farmers and agro-processors affected by the earthquake through grants aimed at rehabilitation of livelihoods and strengthening resilience to future shocks.
WHO is supporting Albania’s early warning and surveillance systems and monitoring water quality and hygiene conditions.

17 November 2021
-  Discussing future cooperation in the area of asset recovery
As part of the regional initiative “From Illicit Financial Flows to Asset Recovery” currently implemented in South Eastern Europe, UNODC conducted a series of meetings with the national authorities of Albania to discuss future cooperation in the area of asset recovery. The meetings were held with representatives from the High Court, Ministry of Justice, the Economic and Financial Crime Branch of the General Directorate of State Police, High Inspectorate for Asset Declarations (HIDAACI), Special Anti-Corruption Structure (SPAK), Financial Intelligence Unit, the Agency for Public Procurement and the Agency for Administration of Seized and Confiscated Assets (AAPSK).
During the meetings, UNODC provided an overview of the objectives and outcomes of the regional initiative related to asset recovery processes and shared plans in mapping out the priorities for each of the jurisdiction, ensuring coordination and synergy of efforts between technical assistance providers in Albania.
This regional initiative supports the Western Balkan jurisdictions, including Albania, in enhancing their capacities to seize proceeds and instrumentalities of crime, with a view to ensure future confiscation, enhance asset recovery capabilities, and pursue proceeds and instrumentalities of crime through national coordination and regional and interregional cooperation while enabling the collection of appropriate statistics on the different steps within the asset recovery process.
In addition, UNODC used this opportunity to discuss  the recently adopted Anti-Corruption and Illicit Finance Roadmap and the UNODC support to the Western Balkans jurisdictions, including Albania, in the implementation of the three  goals agreed under the Roadmap:
- preventing and countering corruption in public procurement;
- further strengthening conflict of interest and asset declaration systems;
- creating a regional network of specialized prosecutors, law enforcement and financial intelligence units.
The Albanian counterparts provided insights on the national priorities and plans, including the establishment of an Asset Recovery Office and highlighted the challenges and opportunities for the successful implementation of the asset recovery and anti-corruption efforts in the country. Other discussed topics included the applicable legal framework in the country as well as the identification of operational and capacity building needs for the relevant practitioners.
The asset recovery activities within the project “From Illicit Financial Flows to Asset Recovery” in South Eastern Europe are conducted in the framework of the UNODC Regional Programme for South Eastern Europe and funded by the Government of the United Kingdom.

Title: FAO supports Albania in EU integration and policy in agriculture and rural development
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
17 November 2021
The new project "EU Integration and Policy Support in Agriculture and Rural Development", funded by FAO, was launched in support of Albania to develop comprehensive agricultural policies for family farms, promote rural development, rural well-being and heritage preservation. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Frida Krifca and the FAO Representative for Albania, Raimund Jehle, praised that the project as one of the recommendations of the Progress Report for the Chapter on Agriculture and Rural Development in accordance with European Union.
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Frida Krifca stressed that the orientation of Albanian agriculture is clearly well defined by the government's ambition to become a member of the European Union. And in this context, the preconditions set by the acquis communautaire, which relate to the approximation of legislation and regulatory framework for the creation of the right environment, as well as the proper functioning of the common European policy, become compasses for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
"An important part of the recommendations clearly defined in the EU progress reports, are returned to the Ministry in priorities, such as the farm register to be completed within 2021, the legal framework for organic agriculture, quality policies, the law on wine, and other recommendations in relation to Chapter 11 of the Progress Report on Agriculture and Rural Development. Specifically, work will begin on another EU recommendation, "Drafting the implementation policy for the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN)", very important for the farm economy, for a much better follow-up policy, under the direction of the Ministry of Agriculture", added minister Frida Krifca.
Thanking FAO for the commitment and cooperation in support of this request of the European Union, Minister Krifca reiterated her commitment to coordinate the agenda of technical cooperation with FAO, for the agreement and the necessary importance of maintaining farm records.
FAO Representative for Albania, Raimund Jehle praised Albania's efforts in the framework of EU membership and integration of the agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sector, and in this context expressed the FAO readiness in support of the Albanian Government to provide relevant expertise to required.
"The new FAO Strategic Framework 2022 - 2031, with the emphasis on better production, better nutrition, better environment and better life underscores this approach, but at the same time ensures that we are supporting our member countries in these efforts, and Albania as a member of FAO", stressed Jehle. He underlined the National Dialogue on Food Systems approach earlier this year and the developed pathways shows the potential of the agri-food sector, but also the challenges to be achieved in this context.
During his speech, Jehle also emphasized on the agreement signed between the United Nations Country team and the Albanian Government on the new UN Cooperation Framework for Albania, where one of the key outcomes is resilient and green growth. "The agri-food sector is a key part of this framework, in the same way contributing to the achievement of the green deal, “Farm to fork" and the biodiversity strategy of the European Union," added Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative for Albania.
The project will enable the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to reach new stages such as: establishing a strong farm data-based decision-making process (FADN system), improvements in the legal framework in the approximation with EU rules for quality policy and organic farming, addressing the marketing standards and policy monitoring with program evaluation, considering how institutionally to support food promotion and food export, improving the advisory service for farmers, setting up an operational price information system of addressing the impact of climate change on farmers and small producers.

For more info about UNOPS activities in South Eastern Europe follow this link https://www.unodc.org/southeasterneurope/
UNODC in cooperation with the Regional Anti-Corruption Initiative (RAI) organized a multi-stakeholder workshop on the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and its Review Mechanism. The workshop brought together 28 civil society, private sector and government representatives from the Western Balkans (including Albania) and Moldova, as well as experts from the UNCAC Coalition and RAI for three-days of sessions and practical exercises aimed to build-up the participants’ capacities and knowledge on anti-corruption, specifically the UNCAC provisions, required to undergo and perform reviews as well as to address the observations emanating from the reviews.
More specifically, the workshop focused on Chapter II (Preventive measures) and Chapter V (Asset recovery) of the Convention that are being reviewed during the second review cycle (2016-2024) and included a mock review exercise to provide the participants with practical experience of the review of selected articles, country visit and observations.
Furthermore, during the workshop, participants discussed how Civil Society Organizations can be better involved in the implementation of the UNCAC, the only legally binding universal anti-corruption instrument that promotes the active participation of civil society in the prevention and fight against corruption.
Non-governmental actors can be involved in the UNCAC review process if invited by their government. Workshops such as this one are instrumental in encouraging this participation by building knowledge on UNCAC and creating a platform where participants can engage in a constructive dialogue on its implementation in their respective jurisdictions, share good practices and lessons learned.
The workshop was organized under the UNODC-RAI joint programme “Southeast Europe - Together Against Corruption (SEE-TAC)” (2020-2023) in cooperation with the UNODC Regional Programme for South Eastern Europe and funded by the Austrian Development Agency.

In an open discussion with APA representatives, Ms Cluney said that it is very important for people to understand that climate change is real - as is the case for the lagoon and surrounding areas and that everyone has a role to play.
Extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and cyclones are having significant impacts on the farmers’ households, small businesses and family farmers in the wetland, lagoon and surrounding areas.
FAO experts have advised for adaptation actions such as: Reforestation along the coastal shore to prevent the seawater flood and the erosion of the bank; maintenance of the water communication channels to maintain the water flow from the sea and to improve water quality and fish stock that the local fishermen will benefit; development of the soil and water management strategy to increase the productivity of soil and lagoon waters and, ecosystem services models evaluation on quality water, habitat, and sediment stabilization services to the local system.

Title: “My body is my own” – UNFPA and UN Women launch art initiative with youth in Albania to promote bodily autonomy
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
17 September 2021
#SDGWeek2021Albania
UNFPA and UN Women launched the campaign "My body is my own", which comes to Albania as a new art initiative aiming to raise awareness on bodily autonomy, gender equality, gender-based violence and antidiscrimination.
The initiative aims to engage young girls and boys from all around Albania, fond of photography and illustration, by using their artworks to convey messages and help spark a conversation around this theme. The first stage will bring these young people together with experts and professional artists in workshops to enhance their knowledge on bodily autonomy, gender equality and gender-based violence, and develop their artistic skills in photography and illustration.The workshops will be conducted by professional photographer Anna Ehrenstein and prominent art lecturers and artists, Ardian Isufi and Harri Aleksi. Psychologists and social workers Izela Tahsii and Anila Sulstarova will also provide a social and psychological perspetive of the topics, to make young people dwell more on the causes and how to best address such sensitive topics without any prejudice or viewed from a positive solution-oriented perspective.

The acquired skills will then be used into artwork which will strive to give impactful messages and an appeal for empowered and informed choices about one's body, without any fear of coercion or violence.
The artworks will be showcased in three exhibitions around Albania during the "16 Days Against Gender-Based Violence" campaign, running from 25 November to 10 December. The best three artworks from each category, photography and illustration, will be selected and awarded prizes by a jury of experts.
The initiative aims to expand on concepts around bodily autonomy and gender equality to make them more tangible for the broader society and to help break down harmful practices and stereotypes that continue to prevail.
“My body is my own” initiative is being organized as part of a UN Joint Programme on ending violence against women and girls in Albania, supported by the Government of Sweden and implemented by UNFPA, UN Women and UNDP.

Title: Switzerland and United Nations agree on continuing support for social inclusion in Albania through the ‘Leave No One Behind’ programme
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
29 July 2021
A new Swiss-UN agreement enables the 2nd phase of the UN Joint Programme “Leave No One Behind’ to improve social protection in Albania
The Government of Switzerland and the United Nations sign the agreement on the 2nd phase of United Nations Joint Programme “Leave No One Behind" (LNB). Through the new agreement Switzerland supports the programme with 8 million Swiss francs for the period 2021-2025.
“Albania is making steps towards a social protection system that ensures that no one is left behind. Switzerland and UN partners encourage an effective social protection system and are supporting Albania in its efforts. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted even more the need for strong social protection in order to have an adequate response for vulnerable groups. This new commitment will serve to continue our support to Albania’s social care and social services  system”, said Swiss Ambassador Adrian Maître.
“The mission of this project, gets into the heart of several SDGs  ( such as SDG 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 16), while the programme’s intention is to bring about systemic change in the area of social protection and social inclusion in Albania”, said Ms. Fiona McCluney, UN Resident Coordinator in Albania.
The UN Resident Coordinator emphasized that  in the next phase,  focus will be given to the consolidation of the Social Care reform, working in close partnership with the central and local government, civil society, the latter an essential partner for the delivery and the achievement of the LNB programme goals. The two cross-cutting principles orienting the programme are governance and gender equality as an articulation of human rights principles.
In this phase of implementation the programme will continue to focus on vulnerable persons and groups to have improved access to public services that support their social inclusion, and well-being, and are empowered to have a voice in public policy decision-making affecting their lives, as well as hold decision-makers accountable for policy implementation.
It strives to do so by aiming at three main objectives: (1) Empowered vulnerable people
The programme builds on the tangible results achieved in the first phase that positively affected the lives of vulnerable communities, demonstrating increased and more equitable investment in people, removing barriers, and creating opportunities for those at risk of exclusion.
More concretely:
The ‘Leave No One Behind’ programme supports the Government of Albania’s efforts to improve the social services system in Albania and it is jointly implemented by four UN Agencies, UNDP in the lead, UNICEF, UNFPA, and UN Women in close partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and municipalities. The programme is part of Swiss cooperation programme with Albania in the area of governance and social inclusion.

Title: The European Commission and the ILO join forces to support young people
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
23 July 2021
A new EC/ILO Technical Assistance Facility set up to pursue youth employment in the Western Balkans
The European Commission (EC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have joined forces to support the institutions responsible for youth employment policy in the Western Balkans in introducing a youth guarantee (YG). The European Training Foundation (ETF) is also a partner in the realization of interventions. Inspired by similar schemes in the EU Member States, a youth guarantee is a commitment to support every young person under the age of 30 who is not employed, in education or training (so-called NEETs). This commitment entitles young people to receive a good quality offer of employment, traineeship, apprenticeship, or continued education within four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed.
The EC/ILO support includes the adaptation of the youth guarantee to the Western Balkans through policy, programming and monitoring support, advanced training, and peer-learning across Western Balkans and EU.
This EC/ILO Technical Assistance Facility (TAF) comes after the second EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Meeting on Employment and Social Affairs on 8 July, at which ministers and representatives responsible for employment endorsed a Declaration on ensuring sustainable labour market integration of young people. The Declaration recognises the disproportionate negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the labour market situation of young people and spells out a commitment to gradually implement youth guarantees in the region. The Declaration takes inspiration from the EU Council Recommendation of 30 October 2020 on A Bridge to Jobs – Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee.
Young people are bearing the brunt of the massive economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, youth employment fell by 8.7 per cent in 2020 compared with 3.7 per cent for adults. An examination of the share of young people who are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) provides a snapshot of young people’s overall vulnerability to the economic situation. Simply stated, if the employment rate goes down, either the NEET rate or the educational participation rate (or both) must increase. Clearly, a reduction of employment compensated by an increase in education is, in principle, more desirable than an increase in NEET rates. However, in the Western Balkans, the loss of employment and the rise in inactivity has not – in general – been offset by a return to education. In Montenegro, for instance, four out of five young people who lost their job became inactive rather than unemployed, but did not go back to education. NEET rates in the Western Balkan economies remained above the pre-crisis level throughout 2020, although in some cases they declined from their peak in 2020Q2, thanks to the measures implemented. In Serbia, one out of five young people fall within the NEET category, but it can be as high as one out of three in other parts of the region.
The ILO has called on governments for action to prevent short-term exit of youth from the labour market turning into long-term exclusion for a generation of young people. The implementation of a youth guarantee could help in avoiding long-term scarring effects, i.e. the increased likelihood of more spells of unemployment or inactivity, lower earning prospects, and lower chances of obtaining a good quality job.
The ILO is a specialised technical agency that leads the action of the United Nations system on employment and the world of work. This partnership with the European Commission to facilitate the establishment of youth guarantees in the Western Balkans builds on the previous EC/ILO Joint Action on the Youth Guarantee targeted at EU member states. It contributes to achieving the objectives set out in the EC’s Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans (EIP) in October 2020. The EIP promotes long-term economic recovery, a green and digital transition, regional integration, and convergence with the European Union; it includes a flagship initiative on the Youth Guarantee with a view to offering better perspectives to young people and mitigating the brain drain

Title: Albania shapes a pathway for sustainable food systems of the country - the final Member State Dialogue of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit.
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
21 July 2021
From food, nutrition, and health, to equitable, resilient and sustainable food systems in Albania
Albania has concluded the Member State Dialogue of the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit by holding the final National Dialogue “From food, nutrition, and health, to equitable, resilient and sustainable food systems in Albania.” The final Dialogue has been a meaningful opportunity to involve and engage with key actors of the food systems in the country to consolidate the outputs from the past national and sub-national Dialogues which has been organized in preparation for the 2021 Summit and identify the intentions and commitments to taking action to improve the national food systems.
The Dialogue was held in a hybrid way, combining in-person and online participants, by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in close cooperation with FAO and the United Nations Country Team in Albania and well attended by UN Resident Coordinator in Albania, representatives of UNDP and UN Women in Albania, experts from academia, and relevant Ministries.
Appreciating the opportunity of welcoming the guests and participants at the final National Dialogue, Ms Milva Ekonomi, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, delivered speech focusing on the great weight of the agriculture sector in the gross domestic product, as well as the needs for modernization and digitalization of the sector to improve the food systems of the country.
Ms Ekonomi stated that the Dialogues have been extraordinary opportunity for all to contribute to the definition of the paths that will lead to the "collectively strengthened" Sustainable Food Systems, to make this vision a reality for all. The purpose of the National Dialogues in Albania was set in line with the Food Systems Summit to transform the way the world produces, consumes and thinks about food within the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
"In the framework of the UN Summit, we as a country confirm our maximum commitment to meeting Sustainable Development Goals, taking into account climate change and the presence of pandemics such as COVID-19," said the Minister Ekonomi. "To join the UN call for a world where no one should be left hungry, poor and malnourished, the need arise to build systems capable of meeting the challenges of the time, as reflected in the new national strategy for agricultural development. Therefore, the recommendations and outcomes from this roundtable will be of importance to the strategy development of the sector," concluded the Minister Ekonomi.
Praising the successful series of Dialogues with high participation from wide range of sectors, Ms Fiona McCluney, the UN Resident Coordinator in Albania, hoped that the pathway will continue to be developed by and be of use to national stakeholders as further advance in the journey to food systems sustainability of the country. "Important keys of sustainable food systems should be the provision of sufficient, safe, healthy, nutritious and affordable food that meets the nutritional needs of all, including children and adolescents. While providing safe and nutritious food, sustainable food systems should foster inclusive economic development and social equality, and provide adequate incentives and returns to food producers, processors and distributors,” Ms McCluney emphasized. She added that sustainable food systems also should optimize the use of natural resources and protect the environment through sustainable agricultural practices, efficient and safe food value chains and reductions in food loss and waste.
Ms Ermira Gjeci, the National Dialogue Convenor has expressed the willingness to build partnerships with multi-sectoral and multi-level stakeholders and promote education on the sustainable food system, food safety and nutrition to make behaviour change of producers as well as consumers, and to address the real challenges of food systems in Albania.
The consolidated outputs and conclusions presented by the discussants will be presented at the Pre-Summit, where Albania will be represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Milva Ekonomi. The Pre-Summit of the UN Food Systems Summit will take place in Rome from 26–28 July 2021.

Title: FAO and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development together for women’s empowerment in agriculture
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
06 July 2021
FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development signed in a virtual ceremony the agreement on Gender Rural Equality and Tourism project (GREAT) that contributes to rural women's empowerment in Albania and strengthens its role and contribution in community in context of Agenda 2030.
The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Milva Ekonomi, emphasized the importance of the project in strengthening rural women's capacity and their development in businesses. "The project will provide training for rural advisory services, Agricultural Technology Transfer Centers, municipal authorities and gender-related services related to the value chain and agritourism," said Minister Ekonomi. During her speech, minister expressed that the formation of gender equal group on a local action will be another priority of the project added that the Local Action Group Law, which will be passed in the Parliament very soon to strengthen the role of women in the rural development.
For the next phase, minister added that is planning to build three incubators of traditional products that women have opportunity to gather and promote the value chain among other women in rural areas.
"The project is based on best practices applied in other countries and tries to extend them in the Albanian context by implementing innovative approaches aimed at promoting the co-manager of farms and increasing the capacity of rural advisory services at the local level to provide gender-responsive services for rural tourism, agribusiness and value chain development", stressed FAO Representative in Albania Raimund Jehle. FAO would work closely with national authorities to design and implement a gender-responsive legal and policy framework that will contribute to the sustainable economic empowerment of rural women.
The total budget of the GREAT project is 1 million 350 thousand Euros and is implemented by UN Women, the Italian Cooperation and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, where the component implemented by FAO is 678 thousand dollars.
"FAO will advocate for women staff in rural service delivery and introduce gender equality in new service delivery. There are social, cultural and trade barriers for women moving up the value chain. Therefore, work will be focused in promoting the untapped potential and value of the role of women in agriculture and the benefits it can bring to the rural economy through awareness and dedicated campaigns," highlighted Jehle.
GREAT project will assist rural women in capacity building and business creation, self-organizing and registering as local groups and improving their funding opportunities. Value chains of local and traditional products with a strong commitment and perspective of rural women will be selected in each implementation area to add value to the final product, strengthen collaborative work, improve market access and strengthen the role of rural women in agriculture and rural development.
The project contributes to the FAO Strategic Framework for rural poverty reduction, equal access to productive resources, services, organizations and markets, sustainability, Country Programming Framework, policy support, capacity development, and knowledge development accelerate gender equality and economic empowerment of rural women in line with the Regional Initiative 1.

Title: UNODC's World Drug Report 2021 launched
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
25 June 2021
Around 275 million people used drugs worldwide in the last year, while over 36 million people suffered from drug use disorders, according to the 2021 World Drug Report, released today by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
The Report further noted that in the last 24 years cannabis potency had increased by as much as four times in parts of the world, even as the percentage of adolescents who perceived the drug as harmful fell by as much as 40 per cent, despite evidence that cannabis use is associated with a variety of health and other harms, especially among regular long-term users.
"Lower perception of drug use risks has been linked to higher rates of drug use, and the findings of UNODC’s 2021 World Drug Report highlight the need to close the gap between perception and reality to educate young people and safeguard public health,” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly.
“The theme of this year’s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is “Share facts on drugs. Save lives”, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the evidence base and raising public awareness, so that the international community, governments, civil society, families and youth can make informed decisions, better target efforts to prevent and treat drug use, and tackle world drug challenges.”
According to the Report, the percentage of Δ9-THC —the main psychoactive component in cannabis— has risen from around six per cent to more than 11 per cent in Europe between 2002-2019, and around four per cent to 16 per cent in the United States between 1995-2019, while the percentage of adolescents that perceived cannabis as harmful declined by 40 per cent in the United States and by 25 per cent in Europe.
Moreover, most countries have reported a rise in the use of cannabis during the pandemic. In surveys of health professionals across 77 countries, 42 per cent asserted that cannabis use had increased. A rise in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs has also been observed in the same period.
Drug Use Rising, but Science-Based Treatment More Available
Between 2010-2019 the number of people using drugs increased by 22 per cent, owing in part to global population growth. Based on demographic changes alone, current projections suggest an 11 per cent rise in the number of people who use drugs globally by 2030 -- and a marked increase of 40 per cent in Africa, due to its rapidly growing and young population.
According to the latest global estimates, about 5.5 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 64 years have used drugs at least once in the past year, while 36.3 million people, or 13 per cent of the total number of persons who use drugs, suffer from drug use disorders.
Globally, over 11 million people are estimated to inject drugs, half of whom are living with Hepatitis C. Opioids continue to account for the largest burden of disease attributed to drug use.
The two pharmaceutical opioids most commonly used to treat people with opioid use disorders, methadone and buprenorphine, have become increasingly accessible over the past two decades. The amount available for medical use has increased six-fold since 1999, from 557 million daily doses to 3,317 million by 2019, indicating that science-based pharmacological treatment is more available now than in the past.
The Dark Web
Drug markets on the dark web only emerged a decade ago but major ones are now worth at least US$ 315 million in annual sales. Although this is just a fraction of overall drug sales, the trend is upwards with a fourfold increase between 2011 to mid-2017 and mid-2017 to 2020.
Rapid technological innovation, combined with the agility and adaptability of those using new platforms to sell drugs and other substances, is likely to usher in a globalized market where all drugs are more available and accessible everywhere. This, in turn, could trigger accelerated changes in patterns of drug use and entail public health implications, according to the Report.
The Drug Market Rebounds and Shifts
The new report shows that drug markets have swiftly resumed operations after the initial disruption at the onset of the pandemic; a burst that has triggered or accelerated certain pre-existing trafficking dynamics across the global drug market. Among these are: increasingly larger shipments of illicit drugs, a rise in the frequency of overland and water-way routes used for trafficking, greater use of private planes for the purpose of drug trafficking, and an upsurge in the use of contactless methods to deliver drugs to end-consumers.
The resilience of drug markets during the pandemic has demonstrated once again traffickers’ ability to adapt quickly to changed environments and circumstances.
The Report also noted that cocaine supply chains to Europe are diversifying, pushing prices down and quality up and thereby threatening Europe with a further expansion of the cocaine market. This is likely to widen the potential harm caused by the drug in the region.
The number of new psychoactive substances (NPS) emerging on the global market fell from 163 in 2013 to 71 in 2019. This reflects trends in North America, Europe and Asia. The findings suggest national and international control systems have succeeded in limiting the spread of NPS in high income countries, where NPS first emerged a decade ago.
Drug Risks, New Developments Spurred by Pandemic
COVID-19 has triggered innovation and adaptation in drug prevention and treatment services through more flexible models of service delivery. Many countries have introduced or expanded telemedicine services due to the pandemic, which for drug users means that healthcare workers can now offer counselling or initial assessments over the telephone and use electronic systems to prescribe controlled substances.
While the impact of COVID-19 on drug challenges is not yet fully known, the analysis suggests that the pandemic has brought increasing economic hardship that is likely to make illicit drug cultivation more appealing to fragile rural communities. The social impact of the pandemic –driving a rise in inequality, poverty, and mental health conditions particularly among already vulnerable populations-- represent factors that could push more people into drug use.

Title: UNODC: Over 300kg of cocaine seized at Durres Port, Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
24 June 2021
Durres Port Control Unit is supported by the UNODC-WCO Container Control Programme
A seizure of 324.4kg of cocaine, with a locally estimated street value over 16 million euros, was made in a truck attempting to depart Albania but intercepted at Durres Port. Following the inspection protocols and the use of non-intrusive inspection techniques, anomalies were noted in the spare fuel tank of the truck. With the help of the Durres Port Control Unit (PCU) officers, trained in specialized search and examination techniques, 300 packages were recovered and field-tested positive for cocaine.
The routing of the truck showed that it entered Albania through the Qafa Thana Border Crossing Point (BCP), on the border with North Macedonia. The driver of the truck, a national of North Macedonia, was arrested and turned over to the Prosecution Office for further criminal investigation.
The PCU officers, some of whom also have judicial police functions, are actively involved in analyzing the risk indicators to determine elements associated with the origins, transit route and final destination of the vehicle. As a result of this analysis, officers will benefit from the various risk metrics refining thereby local risk indicators and building knowledge and experience for improved interdiction results and trade facilitation.
Since the beginning of 2021, the Durres PCU officers contributed to the seizure of over half a ton of cocaine.
The Durres PCU was established and is supported by the UNODC-WCO Container Control Programme and contributions from various donors, the current one being the Government  of France.

Title: First National Dialogue on Sustainable Food System kicks off in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
10 June 2021
In the framework of the United Nations Food Systems Summit,  September 2021, Albania launched the first Member State Dialogue at the national level aiming to identify national solutions to establish the future direction towards sustainable food systems and include a broad range of stakeholders to support the pathways.
The Dialogue was convened by Ms Ermira Gjeci, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, in line with Government's ambition to building equitable, resilient and sustainable food systems in Albania.
"Throughout the National Dialogues, we hope to achieve a positive change in mentality and behaviour,” said Ms Ermira Gjeci, the National Dialogue Convenor, while opening the Dialogue. “Identifying the real challenges faced by the various groups and actors involved and related to the whole food systems in Albania and promoting partnership with the private sector are needed to find the most efficient and effective problem-solving approaches and providing better education to the general public on food safety and nutrition is also important.”
Introducing the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit, Ms Fiona McCluney, the UN Albania Resident Coordinator, highlighted that the Food Systems Summit will be the opportunity to invigorate the progress on achieving the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as to shape Albania’s national pathways to sustainable food systems which can also contribute to a world where no one is left behind. The climate change-related concerns on the agriculture sector and food systems are also raised by Mr Arben Kipi, Assistant FAO Representative in Albania, to motivate and encourage the participants to join the discussion.
Moderated by Ms Valbona Paluka, Food Safety Expert and the Dialogue Curator, the Dialogue also addressed how the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of food systems, their essential role for societies, and the many links between food and distribution systems. While emphasizing the importance of multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder response to these challenges, the Dialogue opened the discussion with four speakers to address different perspective and topic areas in food systems.
Ms Jolanda Hyska, Head of Nutrition and Food Safety Sector, Institute of Public Health, opened the discussion focusing on food safety and nutrition; Mr Orjon Xhoxhi, PhD, Department of Agribusiness Management, Agricultural University of Tirana presented the issue on sustainable consumption patterns and nature-positive production; Mr Eno Ngjela, Programme Specialist, UNDP, addressed how to advance the equitable livelihoods and value distribution throughout the whole food systems; and Ms Jiyoung Nam, Climate Change Specialist, FAO, presented the current status of food systems in Albania regarding resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stresses.
The first National Dialogue will be followed by two subnational Dialogues to focus on different regions in Albania to address different challenges and facilitate the exchange of information and experiences to identify appropriate policy actions for the sustainable transformation of the region's food systems and final national-level Dialogue will follow in July.

Title: Partnering to combat Climate Change and for a Successful COP26

05 June 2021
A UN World Environment Day Joint Statement by:
Duncan Norman, Ambassador of the United Kingdom to the Republic of Albania
Fabrizio Bucci, Ambassador of Italy to the Republic of Albania
Fiona McCluney, United Nations Resident Coordinator to the Republic of Albania
A UN World Environment Day Joint Statement by:
Duncan Norman, Ambassador of the United Kingdom to the Republic of Albania
Fabrizio Bucci, Ambassador of Italy to the Republic of Albania
Fiona McCluney, United Nations Resident Coordinator to the Republic of Albania

The world is in a climate emergency and climate change is the greatest risk facing us all. The next United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), hosted by the United Kingdom in partnership with Italy in November this year in Glasgow, will bring together over 30,000 heads of state, climate experts, and campaigners to one forum to reach a critical agreement on how to tackle climate change.
The Conference will focus around four key goals: securing global net zero by 2050 and keeping 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach; protecting communities and natural habitats; mobilising finance; and working together to finalise the Paris Rulebook and turning ambition into action by ensuring collaboration between governments, businesses, social partners, civil society, academia and researchers.
Before 30 July, all countries should come forward with ambitious new nationally determined contributions, and net zero commitments. All countries should also submit Adaption Communications and join the Adaption Action Coalition so we can work together to find solutions to some of the most challenging impacts of climate change. Having worked closely to deliver the landmark Paris Agreement, we are committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050 and to ensure its success by reducing our own emissions and by cooperating with our global partners, including Albania.
In welcoming the decision by the Government of Albania on passing the law on Climate Change and the on-going work on a more ambitious and enhanced nationally determined contributions, we recognize that Albania is a highly vulnerable country to the effects of the climate change. Even though Albania’s national emissions represent only a small share of global emissions, we recall the importance to take the necessary steps to keep a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit within reach, including through commitments to net zero emissions by 2050.
Reaching ‘net zero’ means increasing the ambition of the country’s plans to decarbonize, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, diversifying the energy mix, improving energy efficiency in line with the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans and continuing on the energy transition path highlighted in the Country’s National Energy Strategy.  It means phasing out polluting means of transport and moving to sustainable mobility, protecting and restoring forests and critical ecosystems, strengthening environmental governance, and transitioning towards sustainable agriculture. It means taking our responsibility in ensuring the green transition of industry, from being the root cause of climate change to becoming the solution. It means matching increased ambition with an equal amount of action, ensuring the country’s institutions are up to the task of promoting and enforcing deep decarbonisation.
On this day, the World Environment Day, we recall the need to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats. In this regard, in reaffirming our concern about the recent revision of boundaries of protected areas, we urge Albania to review the published study on protected areas by involving the scientific community and other stakeholders, in full compliance with the EU acquis, local and international law. Further, we strongly recommend building climate resilience, and addressing the persistent gender gaps in the response to climate change.
The Covid-19 recovery offers a once in a generation opportunity to change the way we do business and align finance with climate action. Prosperity and climate action go hand in hand. Evidence shows that unmitigated climate change could cause devastating economic consequences, while clean growth presents the most significant economic growth opportunity of the 21st century. Albania must ensure that climate change is built into Covid-19 recovery strategies in line with an economic growth that is environmentally sustainable and driven by renewable energy, green jobs and green technologies, especially in a strategic sector such as agriculture, industry, energy, transport, tourism, water and waste management.
We strongly believe that young people are key to raising climate awareness, conserving nature, accelerating renewable energy transition, and adopting environmentally friendly practices, and the climate crisis really is a child rights crisis. This is the reason why we decided to focus the pre-COP meeting in Milan “Youth4Climate” on the participation of young men and women in decision-making processes.
We all need to act now. We need to walk the talk together before it is too late. This is the only way we can meet the commitments set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The decisions we make now will directly affect our ability to safeguard the planet for ourselves and for future generations.

Title: Advancing Gender Equality and the Empowerment of all Women and Girls in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
04 June 2021
Through this joint position paper, the United Nations in Albania identifies four key areas and strategies to accelerate gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the country:
The country is expected to implement additional reforms in various sectors in line with EU gender equality standards. While national institutions have made strides to put women and girls at the forefront of national priorities, the country needs to strengthen implementation of laws and policies, accountability, and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the achievement of all gender related targets in the Sustainable Development Goals, and to make sure that the health pandemic response specifically addresses the impact that COVID 19 is having on women and men, boys and girls.

Title: Third shipment of COVAX facilitated vaccines arrive in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
02 June 2021
Today, a third shipment of 40,800 doses of Astra Zeneca COVID-19 vaccine arrived at Mother Teresa Airport, Tirana, as the final batch of a total of 120,000 doses that Albania signed up to receive through the COVAX mechanism.
COVAX mechanism: Ensuring global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines
The aim of the UN-backed COVAX scheme is to get two billion vaccine doses into the arms of a quarter of the population of poorer countries by the end of 2021. “
The World Health Organization announced the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020, following the declaration of a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) by the Director General on 30th January 2020. Addressing the challenges of this unprecedented crisis affecting people across the globe required new types of global solidarity, extraordinary political commitment, decisive leadership, and the mobilization of the whole scientific community, complemented by the necessary financial and technical resources.
Some fifteen months into the outbreak we see remarkable progress:  No one would have predicted that within less than a year we would have several reliable and effective vaccines available – and that almost 1.5 billion doses would have been administered - an extraordinary success story in terms of scientific advances, agile entrepreneurship and global mobilization.
Ensuring equitable access to vaccines  required intense global collaboration, supported by initiatives  like the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool C-TAP, to facilitate timely, equitable and affordable access of COVID-19 health products by boosting their supply. And it was eventually through mechanisms like the COVAX facility that these global efforts could materialize.
COVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi and the World Health Organization (WHO), alongside key delivery partner UNICEF. COVAX is the vaccine pillar of the ACT Accelerator ACT-A , a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
WHO has developed fair global allocation criteria and prioritization mechanisms for COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX facility. The ultimate objectives are to contain the pandemic, to save lives and protect health care systems, and to restore global economies, based on the universal principles of human rights and equity, grounded on scientific and epidemiological evidence.
The COVAX Facility has already distributed vaccines to more than a hundred countries around the world.
As of 31 May, COVAX has shipped 77 million COVID-19 vaccines to 127 participants; nearly a quarter of those countries would not have been able to start vaccination if it had not been through the COVAX Facility. With major contributions, from United States, United Kingdom, Team Europe including European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden, Canada and Japan (as of 2 June). See all contributors here.
Joining the COVAX mechanism does not preclude countries from entering other bilateral agreements; in a global environment of limited vaccine supplies, which we will continue to face during 2021, global solidarity remains crucial to ensure equitable and fair access to vaccines, so that vulnerable groups in resource constrained countries can get protected.
The ambition of COVAX is to facilitate equitable vaccine access globally: it was set up as a mechanism to ensure vaccine distribution and availability in all countries: high-income, middle-income and low-income. While several countries, in particular high-income ones, have succeeded to mobilize sufficient vaccine quantities to vaccinate and protect their priority target groups, many low-income countries remain struggling to even protect those most vulnerable. WHO strongly encourages countries with excess vaccine doses to share them with the COVAX facility.

As Dr Tedros, the WHO Director General has made clear, “no one is safe until everyone is safe”. We should all have learnt by now that the virus knows no borders. More global vaccine solidarity is needed, as new dynamics and new virus mutations and “variants of concern” could unravel progress everywhere – even in countries that have achieved high vaccination coverage.

Project aims to remediate the effect of the earthquake on Albania’s cultural heritage
UNOPS in Albania continues the work on restauration of Albania’s cultural sites affected by the 2019’s earthquake. Some 27 sites are currently part of the EU For Culture funded interventions. During the EUROPEWEEKS 2021 tour, the EU and local stakeholders were invited by UNOPS to visit several Cultural Heritage sites Including the  Monastery Church of Rubik.
As part of a EUWEEKS expedition at the Skanderbeg Square in Tirana, UNOPS presented the conservation/restoration interventions to be carried at the National Historic Museum along with the restoration of the National Puppet Theater building.


EuropeWeeks2021 tour also stopped at the Venetian Tower in Durres to learn more on use of digital technology which will give an interactive experience to tourists and enhance knowledge about the Tower and the city.

Earlier in the month The EU For Culture project implemented by UNOPS Albania had its 2nd Steering Committee to set next steps forward.
This project seeks to remediate the effect of the earthquake on Albania’s cultural heritage through the rehabilitation of monuments, as well as contribute to Albania’s socio-economic recovery through the construction and upgrade of these sites. It will be important also to support improvements in the capacity of institutions responsible for the management of these cultural monuments and sites to better accommodate tourism.
In the second Project Steering Committee it was agreed to proceed with preliminary design for  10 sites including: Ethnographic Museum in Kruja, Kurcaj Bridge; Venetian Tower in Durres; Hammam of Durres; Ethnographic Museum in Kavaja;
National Puppet Theater in Kavaja; Castle of Lezha, National Historic Museum in Tirana; Castle of Bashtova and Archaeological Museum in Durres.
Aside from the work for the Tirana Mozaic, the St. Ndoi Church in Rodon, and St. Mary Church in Rubik, the other three sites to proceed are: Ethnographic Museum in Kruja, Kurcaj Bridge; Venetian Tower in Durres;

In this project UNOPS is partnering with the Government of Albania and the European Union, as well as with the UN system.
On 26 November 2019, Albania was hit by its most deadly earthquake in a century. The earthquake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale and caused significant casualties and property damage, resulting in 51 deaths, over 1000 injured, and nearly 14,000 people displaced.

Title: UNODC supports practitioners in South Eastern Europe and Italy in addressing drug use disorders among youths
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
24 May 2021
UNODC's Treatnet Family is a science-informed training package on elements of family therapy, intended to support practitioners in the health, social and criminal justice sectors who work with youths and their families in resource limited settings, including those in contact with the criminal justice system.
UNODC organized a regional capacity development workshop on “Treatnet Family: Elements of Family Based Treatment for Youths with Drug Use Disorders including in Contact with the Criminal Justice System: Creating Societies Resilient to Drugs and Crime” for practitioners in South Eastern Europe and Italy with the kind support of the Government of Italy.
Adolescence is a time when an individual pattern of biopsychosocial risk and protective factors might increase or reduce vulnerability for the initiation of substance use or involvement in delinquency. Family can be both a risk and a protective factor and Treatnet Family is designed to enhance and strengthen the protective potential of family interactions in families with adolescents using substances including drugs. Treatnet Family is a science-informed training package on elements of family therapy, intended to support practitioners in the health, social and criminal justice sectors who work with youths and their families in resource limited settings, including those in contact with the criminal justice system. Treatnet Family is part of UNODC’s overall Treatnet training package for the treatment of drug use disorders and the initial development was supported by the government of Japan. Implementation has previously shown positive effects in reducing substance use, improving family functioning and mental health.
“Human connection is the opposite of addiction” could have been the motto of the UNODC Treatnet Family workshop with countries from South Eastern Europe and Italy: 35 practitioners from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia, working with adolescents with substance use problems in their daily practice, joined the online meeting and in a participatory way enhanced their knowledge and skills on addressing issues related to drug use disorders among youths and related problems associated with family settings. The Treatnet Family trainers Molly Bobek and Hendrik Roozen in this workshop are experienced family therapies and trainers.
Treatnet Family focused on theoretical foundations and core assumptions of family therapy, the spectrum of substance use and substance use disorders and mostly on family therapy core strategies such as reframing and the phases of family therapy work. The five-day online workshop provided ample opportunity for exchange between professionals and to discuss ways to address drug use disorders, particularly among youth, as well as associated challenges.
Participating substance use disorder treatment professionals from the region enhanced their understanding of substance use problems in a systemic perspective and in various role plays learnt to help families break negative cycles in their interactions and instead explore new ways of more supportive interactions and taking care of each other.  A practical example of a perspective change and challenging gridlocked family interactions is captured in the phrase “Catch your child doing something nice” instead of looking out for a problem behavior. The event provided the opportunity for exchange and mutual support also at the regional level despite language barriers: the training was supported by simultaneous interpretation into seven languages.
When presenting their follow-up plans, many practitioners indicated their interest to support further expansion of substance use treatment services for adolescents, including through elements of family therapy, in their countries.

22 May 2021
UN Agencies in Albania strongly condemn the criminal offence and stand by all survivors of sexual violence.
Rape and sexual assault are considered severe human rights violations under International Human Rights Treaties the Government has committed too.  The sexual abuse of a teenage girl is a further case in an escalation of sexual violence against women and girls.  In Albania, our studies show that 50% of women and girls have experienced one form of violence in their lifetime.
As UN agencies we call on citizens, men and women, to ‘Speak Out’ to end these horrific abuses. We call on authorities, to make sure perpetrators are brought to justice.
We call on those who provide the specialised services to support a rape survivor - rapid access to emergency medical care, psycho-social and legal services- to work together, to treat women with dignity and support long term healing of women who experience abuse.
We call on the media to protect survivors identity and report responsibly on the case. It is everyone’s job. It’s time to do justice to sexual violence survivors!
UN Agencies in Albania strongly condemn the criminal offence and stand by all survivors of sexual violence.

Title: ILO and Government of Sweden support textile and footwear companies to establish healthy and safe conditions in the workplace
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
28 April 2021
Through the “Empowering Women Against COVID-19” project, financed by the Government of Sweden, the ILO supported ten textile and footwear companies to establish healthy and safe conditions in the workplace. The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) interventions were specific to the situation of the selected companies and ensured the safe return to work after the COVID-19 pandemic for around 2,000 women workers. Six textile and footwear companies installed ventilation systems that ensure airflow and dust filtering. One of the company owners mentioned that the difference the new ventilation system made was huge. “Before the ventilation system was in place, you could barely see the end of the fabric. The view was so cloudy.”
Five other companies upgraded the conditions of the sanitary facilities and installed hot tap water. One of them, located in Shkoder also added toilette units. Three other enterprises upgraded the infrastructure of the wardrobes and staff rooms in view of COVID-19 protection requirements.
In addition, the ILO prepared a “Guideline on Safe Return to Work for the Textile and Footwear Sector in Albania”. This document helps companies to reorganise work in accordance with the ILO OSH standards on safe return to the work place and national COVID-19 Red Protocols.
All the Occupational and Health Committees of the selected companies received training on implementing effective occupational health and safety measures, enabling them to promote these standards in their workplaces.
The significance of ensuring healthier and safer workplaces in the textile and footwear sector through this project was highlighted on the 28th of April, the World Occupational Safety and Health Day by Ms. Fiona Mccluney, the UN Resident Coordinator in Albania and the representatives of social partners.

Title: After the ILO training, Albanian judges use International Labour Standards in their decisions
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
16 April 2021
The training courses on International Labour Standards, the first part of the series of courses planned, are supported by the ILO’s Access to Justice in Labour Disputes through Mediation and Conciliation project, funded by the Government of Sweden
On 13-16 April 2021, the ILO Office for Central and Eastern Europe and the International Training Center of the ILO (ITCILO) organized two training courses for judges, together with the Albanian School of Magistrates (ASoM). The training courses on International Labour Standards, the first part of the series of courses planned, are supported by the ILO’s Access to Justice in Labour Disputes through Mediation and Conciliation project, funded by the Government of Sweden.
The course was developed jointly by international and national experts and aims to equip judges and candidate magistrates with sound knowledge of international labour law and international labour standards in selected areas.
The training programme examines international labour standards as a legal source for filling legislative gaps, interpreting ambiguous legal provisions and strengthening domestic case law on labour issues. The training provides useful resources and a methodology for the continuous education of judges by the School of Magistrate.
"We do hope that the series of trainings organized in Albania will be very beneficial to judges and ultimately for the people, for workers and employers of Albania, who are looking for a quick and fair resolution of their disputes." - says Cristina Mihes, expert on Social Dialogue and Labour Law, ILO Office for Central and Eastern Europe
It covers fundamental principles and rights at work, such as: freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, equality and non-discrimination in employment and occupation, elimination of violence and harassment in the world of work, protection against unfair termination of employment and determination of the existence of the employment relationship, occupational safety and health. Global legal and case law databases for judges and other law practitioners, such as NORMLEX and ITCILO compendium of selected judicial decisions are also made available to national judges.
In total, 50 judges and candidate magistrates attended the first training courses with a majority of 62% women.
Mr. Sokol Berberi, Head of the Continuous Training Programme of the School of Magistrates highlighted the special value of the course:  ‘These training courses are provided by distinguished international experts in labour law, with depth knowledge in this area, accompanied by exposure to international jurisprudence. In addition, these courses have a special importance thanks to the cooperation between international and national experts, which   allows us to compare our own practice with the international. This training will provide an opportunity to Albanian judges and magistrates candidates to examine and identify methods on how to use and apply international labour standards in their daily practice.’
“The course topics constitute the most frequent cases of labour disputes at courts, but also more sensitive issues” said Ms. Borana Mustafaraj, the Academic Advisor of the School of Magistrates. “I am referring here to certain rights of fundamental importance, such as the right to equal opportunities and treatment at work and profession, or the freedom to organize collectively at work. Improving the response and attitude towards violations of these rights remains a challenging issue for Albania, and here the role of the judge is fundamental.”
Ms Cristina Mihes, ILO Labour Law and Social Dialogue Senior Specialist said “We do hope that the series of trainings we organize will be very beneficial to judges in Albania and ultimately for the people, for workers and employers of Albania, who are looking for a quick and fair resolution of their disputes.”
The participants joined the on-line Community of Practice (CoP) which enables access to information, such as judgments relying on international labour law sources; publications; training curricula; events delivered in the field of international labour law. The CoP can trigger discussions on subjects of common interest related to international labour law through an on-line forum.
After the ILS training, one of the trainees, Ms Maela Alicanaj, judge in the District Court of Fieri, reiterated the importance of this training for her professional work, highlighting the value of the training platform in two recent cases: “For my work as a judge, the knowledge I gained during the training and through the training materials, and also the opportunity to access the numerous sources of information through the training platform turned out to be very useful and effective. In two cases, I dealt with immediately after the training, I rendered two decisions, in which I used the advanced knowledge acquired during the training and online resources on ILO Conventions on Protection of Wages and Termination of Employment respectively”.
The series of ILS training courses is part of the continuous training programme of the Albanian School of Magistrates.

Title: First batch of COVAX-facilitated vaccines reach Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
12 March 2021
The first 38,400 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines arrived today in Albania through COVAX -  the UN led global facility established to secure fair and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world.
The UN Resident Coordinator Fiona McCluney, UNICEF Representative Roberto De Bernardi and WHO Albania Representative, Gerald Rockenschaub joined Minister of Health and Social Protection Ogerta Manastirliu to welcome the shipment at ‘Mother Teresa’ International Airport in Tirana.
On behalf of the UN Country Team in Albania, Ms. McCluney praised Albania for being part of the global vaccine equity mechanism: “We are so glad to witness today the start of COVAX-facilitated vaccine rollout. COVAX initiative is ‘walking the talk’ of multilateralism – we can only win this pandemic together.  Beyond ensuring a fast rollout of vaccines to Albania, being part of COVAX signifies strong support for the equal global distribution of vaccines.” – she said.
UNICEF’s Roberto De Bernardi said that COVAX means best availability and fastest delivery of vaccines: “Thanks to COVAX and its global scale, the cost of vaccines is significantly lower than any alternative commercial path and, thanks to UNICEF’s vaccine procurement strength, the best availability and fastest possible delivery of life-saving vaccines is guaranteed.” – he said.
WHO Representative in Albania stressed that the vaccine rollout through the international solidarity mechanism of the COVAX Facility will help to save lives, first and foremost to protect the healthcare workers, as well as the elderly and high-risk groups, but it is equally important not to rely solely on vaccines. “Basic public health measures remain the foundation of the response: we need to reinforce these,” – Dr Rockenschaub said.
More than 2.5 million people around the world have died from COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 vaccines will stop people from dying, prevent new variants from emerging, reignite economies and offer the best hope to end the pandemic.
The COVAX initiative is co-led by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), alongside its key delivering partner UNICEF.

Title: United Nations supports Albania in strengthening capacities to increase financing for Sustainable Development Goals
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
03 February 2021
A team of five UN agencies led by UNDP are working closely with the Albanian government, legislature and other key stakeholders to strengthen country’s national and local level capacities to strengthen financing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 1.1 million USD, Joint SDG Fund intervention “Strategic Policy Options for SDG Financing” focuses on identifying fiscal space and the introduction of innovative solutions for financing SDGs.
Opening the Steering Committee meeting, the UN’s Resident Coordinator in Albania, Ms. Fiona McCluney noted  this  intervention is timely and much needed: “The pandemic exposed to all of us the fragility of our health and social protection systems, making SDGs more relevant than ever ” she said.
Speaking about the key benefits of the intervention, McCluney highlighted the role that it plays in supporting Albania’s strategic objectives, “the Strategic Policy Options for SDG Financing” can unlock the necessary financing – not only for the achievement of SDGs, but also to support and accelerate the EU integration agenda” – she added.
Implementation of the activities is expected to provide sound and feasible solutions for more effective investments in SDGs and, in turn, produce large scale results that reach the most vulnerable parts of Albanian society, especially children and women living in the poorest locations. Such change is delivered through gathering solid evidence on the costs to the country of not investing in the SDGs, through collection of data and analysis of fiscal space. As well as establishing, tools for financing policies and measuring impact, and strengthening capacities of those institutions charged with financing the SDG’s and, supporting a national dialogue on SDG financing in Albania.
For the Minister of Finance and Economy, H.E. Ms. Anila Denaj, the project’s strong impact is to accelerate investment oriented by SDGs, in line with the reforms undertaken in the recent years by the Albanian Government. She expressed the engagement of the Government in ensuring an improved environment and understanding among all stakeholders to better prioritize the financing for SDGs in the era of COVID and beyond.
The strategic intervention is implemented jointly by UNDP, UNICEF, ILO in close collaboration with UNFPA and UN WOMEN. The agencies will work with the Ministry of Finance and Economy, Ministry of Health and Social Protection, the Parliament of Albania and other key institutions. It is funded by the UN Joint SDG Fund with global contributions from Denmark, European Union, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.

Title: UNODC and Partners launch new Programme: Southeast Europe Together Against Corruption (SEE-TAC)
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
29 January 2021
The UNODC report on Measuring Organized Crime in the Western Balkans has shown that corruption and organized crime are mutually reinforcing, leading to systemic weaknesses in the rule of law. The corrosive effects of organized crime and corruption on state institutions is a matter of great concern to all Western Balkan States, as corruption is a crucial facilitator for organized crime and a preeminent factor for explaining the inefficiency of policy interventions.
To assist Member States in the region, UNODC successfully launched and implemented a five-year programme in 2015, the Southeast Europe Regional Programme on Strengthening the Capacity of Anti-Corruption Authorities and Civil Society to Combat Corruption and Contribute to the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) Review Process.
Following an external evaluation and capitalizing on the results achieved during the programme, UNODC together with the Regional Anti-Corruption Initiative (RAI) have designed a new programme: Southeast Europe – Together Against Corruption (SEE-TAC), funded by the Austrian Development Agency (ADA).
An online meeting introducing the new initiative gathered over 80 participants, to mark the launch of three years of activities towards strengthening the resilience of Southeast Europe and combating corruption. This will be achieved by enhancing the capacity of governments, civil society organizations, the private sector and the media; to prevent and fight corruption while effectively implementing the UNCAC.
At the opening of the event, Laura Stefan, RAI Chairperson, noted that the first phase of the programme will identify challenges and successes from the previous programme, which were integrated into the design of the new initiative. Ms. Stefan also extended her appreciation for the support of ADA and other donors.
From her part, Michaela Flenner, Programme Manager for South Eastern Europe with the ADA, pointed out that the current programme deals with much more than anti-corruption matters, delving deeply into the cross-cutting issues of gender equality and social inclusion, while emphasizing a human rights-based approach.
At the core of the SEE-TAC programme is the UNCAC: the only legally binding universal anti-corruption instrument, and one that recognizes the important role of cooperation between the private sector and civil society in combating corruption.
During the virtual launch, Virginia de Abajo-Marqués, UNODC Regional Asset Recovery and Anti-Corruption Advisor for the Western Balkans, underlined that the experiences and technical expertise of non-governmental stakeholders make them essential partners in the prevention and fight against corruption. She further observed that the two UNCAC country reviews undertaken in the region thus far – namely in Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia – involved committed non-governmental actors. This result she proudly attributed to the success of UNODC’s multi-stakeholder workshops.
A private sector representative, Ardita Seknaj, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Commerce in Albania, mentioned that due to UNODC and RAI’s efforts, the private sector has joined forces with civil society organizations and built collective action initiatives in the country, which led to a notable improvement of national anti-corruption strategies and an alignment with the best international practices.
Under the auspices of the SEE-TAC Programme, 25 public institutions, 40 business representatives and 175 civil society representatives will be working together alongside the UNCAC Coalition and the WB6 Chamber Investment Forum, on the implementation of a wide range of activities throughout the upcoming years.
Enhancing the capacity and involvement of civil society in anti-corruption activities – notably in relation to UNCAC – is part of the UNODC Regional Programme for South Eastern Europe, which provides the framework for UNODC initiatives throughout the region.

Title: UNODC supports partnership with the private business operators in border control in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
28 January 2021
The UNODC-WCO Container Control Programme (CCP) in Albania organized a one-day workshop on the enhancement of cooperation and partnership between the Air Cargo Control Unit (ACCU) operating at Tirana International Airport (TIA) and the private business operators.
The workshop, which was held in a hybrid manner brought together the officers of the ACCU, representatives from the Customs Administration and State Police, teams of experts from UNODC and WCO and representatives from the operators of fast parcels and postal correspondence couriers. The workshop was also attended and opened by the Director General of the Albanian Customs Administration, who acknowledged the importance of Customs-ACCU-Business partnership as an integral part of a broader undertake for good governance and effective border controls.
The workshop constituted a good opportunity to foster the networking among ACCU officers and business operators and the sharing of knowledge on the ACCU role in the context of improved controls, accountability and facilitation of legitimate trade. The UNODC and WCO experts demonstrated through various examples the different scenarios which would assist the ACCU officers and the business operators in elaborating a continued consultative process and a robust partnership. The workshop also promoted the Standard Operating Procedures related to the functioning of the ACCU while familiarizing the business representatives with the new approaches in handling pre-arrival information for building risk profiles and undertaking effective and timely cargo controls.
Following active discussions, the participants agreed on producing an action plan for the cooperation and exchange of information and agreed to organize follow-up meetings to build a solid partnership aimed at facilitating border control procedures and securing borders.

Title: The final report of UN75 published
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
12 January 2021
In January 2020, the UN launched a yearlong, global initiative to listen to people’s priorities and expectations of international cooperation. Through surveys and dialogues, more than 1.5 million people from all walks of life shared their hopes and fears for the future, and discussed how all actors, including the UN, can innovate and work together to better to address the global challenges we face.



TOP KEY FINDINGS
Over 1.5 million people in 195 countries shared their short- and long-term priorities, their ideas for action and their calls for a more inclusive, transparent UN to lead the response to pressing global challenges.
As COVID-19 reversed progress in human development and widened inequalities, many prioritised access to basic services and support to the hardest hit places and communities in the short-term.
Respondents living in lower human development countries and those living in conflict situations tended to express greater optimism about the future.
While they expect access to health services to improve over the next 25 years, respondents in all regions identified climate change and environmental issues as the number one long-term global challenge.
Other longer-term priorities vary according to income levels, but include rising concern with employment opportunities, respect for human rights and reducing conflict.
97% of respondents believe that international cooperation is important for addressing global challenges, with variation in the degree of importance across regions.
Many respondents look to the United Nations to lead in international cooperation to address immediate and longer-term global challenges, and many also want the Organisation to innovate – to be more inclusive, engaged, accountable and effective.

Title: UN Country Team in Albania runs stakeholder consultations on the new GoA-UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2022-26
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
08 January 2021
Cooperation Framework is the most important instrument to meeting the pledges towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Seventeen UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes with representation in Albania led by the Resident Coordinator Office in cooperation with the Government of Albania are running stakeholder consultations on the Albania-UN new Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (2022-26). This Cooperation Framework is the most important instrument to ensuring the adequate planning and implementation of development activities to keep Albania on track to meet the pledges towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Following initial work to identify the trends as well as the key priorities of focus in the new Programme, in December the UN Country Team conducted a series of consultations involving experts across UN system, key stakeholders and partners to setting the strategic priorities for the new Cooperation Framework and intervention outcomes results framework.
Civil society has a key role to develop and push the development agenda. No development action could be fulfilled without the active participation of and advocacy of civic entities. The consultations with CSOs in November provided significant insights that will be reflected in the ongoing CF development work. Representatives of SCOs underlined the importance of UN’s work with those most left behind: disadvantaged groups from youth, women, people with disabilities and other vulnerable communities.
Consultations with the business and entrepreneurial sector were most effective for understanding the current trends that will influence the development agenda. There was a wealth of expertise by the private sector on the key development areas such as green economy and developments in digital space.
The UNCT has now established a UN Youth Advisory Group (UNYAG) that represents the country and across various social segments.  The UNYAG has already started working to gather opinions of more through a public youth survey which asks specific question as for the youth priorities that need be targeted in the CF. Results of the youth survey are expected to come out by mid-January 2021.
In the next phase of CF development, the UNCT will have detailed discussions with Albanian Government and Parliament ahead of a final draft CF that will be shared with stakeholders.

Title: IOM supporting Albania to building stronger ties with diaspora
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
07 January 2021
IOM launches  “Connect Albania”, an innovative mechanism aimed at boosting investments.
Albania has always had strong historical, geographical, cultural, and economic links with Italy, which is home to 500,000 citizens of Albanian origin.
This relationship is being reinforced on International Migrants Day and the National Diaspora Day (18 December) with the launch of “Connect Albania”, an innovative mechanism aimed at boosting investment. It will engage members of the Albanian Diaspora all over the world, with an initial focus on Italy.



Attendees at today’s “Diaspora Bridges” on-line launch event, organized by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) in coordination with the Albanian State Minister for Diaspora, heard how vital the small country’s diaspora is to potential foreign investors.
The Connect Albania launching event was attended by the highest representatives of Albanian government and the donor of the programme: Pandeli Majko, Albanian State Minister for Diaspora; Eduard Shalsi, Minister of State for the Protection of Entrepreneurship, Besart Kadia, Deputy Minister of Ministry of Finance and Economy, Sokol Dedja, Deputy Minister of Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Nino Merola, Representative of AICS in the Western Balkans; and Representatives of diplomatic missions.
In addition to the 500,000 Albanians living and working in Italy, there are estimates of nearly one million more Albanians outside the country, mostly in Europe, but also with significant presence in North America (USA and Canada) as well as other regions. Moreover, remittance flows from these overseas workers are believed to account for nearly 10 per cent of Albania’s 2020 Gross Domestic Product or approximately USD 4.3 billion from a total of USD 43 billion.
Opening the event, Pandeli Majko, State Minister for Diaspora, stressed that engaging the members of diaspora will facilitate the circulation of human, social and financial capital.
Alma Jani, Head of IOM Albania, noted “there is a huge need now to support new ways of promoting diaspora to retain their connection to Albania and contribute to its economic and social growth.”
Eduard Shalsi, Minister of State for the Protection of Entrepreneurship pointed to “the close links Albania has with the EU market, the advantages of free trade agreements and other investment incentives which offer distinct economic advantages to foreign investors.”
Despite the temporary slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the World Bank, the Albanian economy will recover in 2021 with a growth rate of around eight per cent, thus continuing the positive trend of the last 10 years, during which the country has experienced extraordinary growth.
According to the “Growth Lab” Center for International Development at Harvard University, since 2013, per capita growth has reached around 3.5 per cent per annum on average. Overall, the Country has macroeconomic stability, supported by a banking and financial market that has shown solidity and ability to resist crises.
The global pandemic has shown vulnerabilities that demand a change of perspective by reshaping the current global business model, which will involve the reorganization of some supply chains, which will become more regional.
“Italian Cooperation has been present in Albania since 1991”, said Nino Merola, Representative of AICS in the Western Balkans. “Connect Albania is another step forward to strengthen the relationship between two countries and the contribution to the economic development of Albania.”
According to the Albanian Institute of Statistics, trade with Italy represents 36.2 per cent of the total volume of trade. In 2018, 48 per cent of Albanian exports went to Italy while imports in the other direction came to 27.3 per cent of total trade.
Connect Albania will contribute to increase investments in Albania, that will create new jobs and boost economic growth. IOM’s Albania Diaspora Programme is implemented by IOM Albania with funding from the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) in coordination with the Albanian’s State Minister for Diaspora, as well as the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance and Economy through the Albanian Investment Development Agency (AIDA).

Title: UNIDO and FAO kick off local consultations on Blue Economy Country Programme
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
23 December 2020
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), started this week consultation meetings regarding the contribution program of UN agencies to the Albanian Government from the preparation phase of the final draft of the Blue Economy Program in the Country.
Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Roland Kristo, presented the national strategy on development fisheries and aquaculture sector objectives in the short and long term and stressed the importance of efficiency capacities in marine aquaculture and artisanal sector. "We are working in the preparation and approval of regulations regarding data collection and starting a necessary work to reactivate the vessel monitoring system. The artisanal sector remained a sensitive sector for the government. With EU support, Albania is at the final stage to support fisheries organizations and cooperatives", said Mr. Kristo. Further, he added that the sector needs skills development, limited fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea, and needs for ecosystem' management to challenge climate change.
The actors emphasized the Blue Economic program's aim for identifying the immediate interventions among all parties involved as a cross-cutting sector, which offers a lot of potential for the country's future economic development. The experts and the representative from the private sector addressed the immediate needs for capacity building, emphasized the lack of professional fisheries, skills development in terms of Vocational and Educational Training programs in the country, and increasing the incentives for the young entrepreneurs, establishing of start-ups in terms of career, and supporting women working in fisheries and aquaculture sector. The private sector representative emphasized the need for regional cooperation and a voice in development strategy, ensuring sustainable growth and enlarging the market through regional cooperation. Value-added processing, competition, social inclusion, financial support, grouping to the clusters to develop a pilot project for cluster sector in the fishing industry to improve competitiveness in inland fishing and freshwater aquaculture were some of the issues struggling the private sector.
UNIDO Country Coordinator, Ms. Elvana Zhezha, and Assistant FAO Representative for Albania Mr. Arben Kipi expressed the support of the UN agencies to the Albanian Government through their programs in Albania, with specific interventions in the future Blue Economy Country Programme focused on standards and quality priorities, analysis and specific program in Albania, based on data collection and processing industry to enlarge the access of Albanian producers in EU markets as well. The international experts from UNIDO pointed out the region's tendency in terms of their blue economy, not more increasing in scale but quality, the role of sustainability certification becoming a defacto market requirement. This could increase the sector and adding more value to natural resources. Ecommerce and access to EU Market, financial support for investments in processing industries, regional cooperation, including GFCM and EEFCA cooperation, were the crucial issues discussed in the meeting.
The meeting involved proactive interventions from all the participants who expressed the consultations' role in identifying the fishery and aquaculture sector's long-term goals in Albania. The meeting highlighted as the main challenges in the sustainable and competitive sector are closely linked to standards and qualities, incentives as new investments, financial support due to the pandemic situation, and finding innovative solutions. During December, the consultations prioritized engaging the local stakeholders and the respective international and national key experts to prepare and introduce a new component in the current country program of the Blue Economic draft. Further, the new component will tackle the country's needs to developing the Fisheries & Aquaculture sector.
About the Blue Economy Country Programme
The Blue Economy program funded by Norway and the Government of Albania is a higher priority of the government. The latter has started the drafting of the National Development Programme on Blue Economy. The draft document was presented to donors and partners at the end of October 2020 for further comments and technical contributions. The Blue Economic Programme's vision and objectives are expected to reflect the respective national and EU policies and SDGs.
Inland fisheries and freshwater resources are vital for rural communities and contribute to aquatic biodiversity. The programme considers including inland capture fisheries and freshwater aquaculture needs within this program's scope, especially within any national fisheries strategy. There is a need for improved infrastructure and education to promote the development of freshwater aquaculture.

Title: Albania identifies key sustainability challenges and opportunities using UNECE’s Water-Food-Energy-Ecosystem Nexus approach
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 December 2020
Economic and social development in Albania crucially depends on the availability and good quality of water, land, forest and environmental resources, which are, however, under increasing pressure, including from climate change. An online consultation on the Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystems Nexus in Albania held on 14 December 2020, provided for broader engagement into a cross-sectoral assessment exercise.
More than 50 officials, stakeholders and experts discussed how to overcome barriers to sustainable development and coordinate actions, essentially discovering an integrated Nexus approach, to reduce trade-offs and to achieve cross-sectoral benefits for all. In Albania, UNECE’s Nexus assessment methodology is applied for the first time at national level as the use so far has been at transboundary river basin or aquifer level.

By pointing at opportunities for synergies in managing and using water and related resources, the South-Eastern Europe Nexus project is promoting the Nexus approach to assist countries in moving towards a better overall resource security. In the context of the project’s activities in Albania, the online consultation was convened by the Global Water Partnership Mediterranean in partnership with UNECE to inform the preparation of the Nexus Assessment.

In the opening statement delivered on behalf of the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Fiona McCluney, her Head of Office Ms. Fioralba Shkodra underlined the value of exploring opportunities how to maximize the impacts from work at different levels and by different sectors, mobilizing resources from local, national and international sources for sustainable development, mindful of the regional connectedness and need for cooperation. She stressed that “Designing, planning, and implementing nexus solutions and investments is in the interest of all sectors’ policy makers because these are associated to lower political risks, higher levels of coherence when it comes to cross-sectoral goals and broader benefits, than strictly sectorally developed solutions.”

Representatives from national authorities shared the latest developments in policymaking in the fields of water resources, water supply and sanitation, energy, irrigation and drainage, forestry and biomass, and environmental protection. Experts and representatives of organisations presented related insights and experiences, feeding into discussions on interlinkages and potential solutions. Participants discussed the practical prioritization of identified interlinkages and mapped out potential steps for enhancing cross-sectoral integration and cooperation at institutional, policy and management levels.

Among the points made was that better cross-sectoral coordination and planning can lead to more effective management in the areas of power production, irrigation and flood risk reduction. Participants considered that the drive to reach climate and energy targets would benefit from increasing the share of non-hydro renewables and upscaling energy efficiency measures, and offered some practical solutions, such as improving water efficiency and recovering energy from wastewater treatment processes. It was noted that such measures would bring mutual benefits for the sectors concerned, not only the environment protection and water management and services, but also the energy sector as the water utilities are a major consumer of energy in Albania.

The insights from the discussion will feed into the Nexus Assessment for Albania, a Technical report under preparation, which will look in detail into the sectoral strategies and policies to assess key interlinkages and assess how they are addressed in the current institutional and policy frameworks.

The meeting also involved a dedicated session on available options to finance Nexus-related interventions. As the project seeks to identify concrete investment options, linking different sectors, the UNECE’s Framework for Nexus solutions and Investments was presented, as well as the European Investment Bank’s financing instruments and Albania’s Country Programme for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). By bringing together key sectors and attention to their objectives, the Nexus approach was recognized to add value to strategic achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and climate action, also from the point of view of resource mobilization for greener economic recovery and development.

Title: UNODC Launches Comprehensive Regional Report on Organized Crime in the Western Balkans
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
14 December 2020
UNODC launched a comprehensive report which sheds light on the nature, characteristics, and level of organized crime in the Western Balkans.
Using qualitative and quantitative data from several sources —including administrative records and court verdicts, as well as interviews with experts, victims, and prisoners— the report offers a comprehensive overview of the structure and modus operandi of criminal groups in the region. It further provides an in-depth analysis of devices that criminals resort to in order to evade justice —such as obstruction of justice and corruption— as well as the different forms of communication they use.
The increasing availability and quality of the data featured in this report make it a go-to reference on organized criminal group involvement in smuggling of migrants, drug production and trafficking, human trafficking, and trafficking in firearms in the Western Balkans. The publication also provides insight into women’s roles in organized crime in the region; a topic often discussed, but rarely researched so far.
When examining persons convicted for offences typically associated with organized crime, it was found that 12 per cent of them were also convicted for being part of an organized crime group. However, marked discrepancies between recorded statistics and qualitative interviews suggest that data on convictions related to organized crime groups may underestimate the true nature of their role within illegal marketplaces.
Covering Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo* UNSCR 1244, the report aims to improve responses to organized crime. This is particularly important, as the rate for convictions in cases related to organized crime show a steady decline throughout the region. While in 2013 there were 744 convictions, by 2017 this number dwindled down to 491 convictions.
Prosecutions, on the other hand, increased by more than six-fold. While there were 217 prosecutions in 2013, in 2017 the number of cases prosecuted grew to 1,328. The Report concludes that the discrepancy between the number of convictions and prosecutions suggests a gap in evidence gathering, constructing successful prosecutions, and properly adjudicating organized crime cases.
The report serves as a useful reference tool for local policy makers, but also acts as a blueprint for any country or region performing systematic assessments of organized crime.

Title: Digital technologies key to accelerate agricultural development in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
11 December 2020
FAO in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development organized a virtual workshop on 25–26 November to foster the development of e-agriculture in Albania. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) can offer unprecedented opportunities for accelerating agricultural development in the post-2020 development agenda.
The event aimed to raise awareness about the potential of digital technologies in Albania’s agriculture sector, where the adoption of new digital technologies for green economic growth along with social inclusion is a high priority for the government.
Albania is moving ahead with developing its digital agenda and, at the same time, the country is about the revise it agricultural strategy, creating a momentum for developing a digital agriculture strategy.
“A digital agriculture strategy should be inclusive, aligned with the principle of ‘leaving no one behind’,” said Sophie Treinen, FAO’s regional focal point for digital agriculture. “All actors in the agricultural sector should be able to access, afford, and use the appropriate digital technologies adapted to their needs. However, this will not happen without a coordinated approach involving each of them. This is why it is important to have a national framework for maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks.”
FAO and the International Telecommunication Union have developed guidelines to help define a national framework that can become a national strategy on digital agriculture.
“In the post-pandemic world, technology and information systems should become even more efficient, sustainable, affordable, and actionable. We invite all actors present at the workshop to co-develop the national digital agriculture strategy for Albania,” Treinen added.
Albania is in the process of joining the European Union and adoption of European policies on digital agenda is a priority. The event took place in the framework of the first steps for planning and developing a complex process for digitalization of agriculture.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the power of digital technologies in ensuring the continuation of professional and personal lives while respecting protection measures. The crisis also revealed digital disparities between social classes and geographical groups. To this end, FAO pays special attention to support smallholders and family farmers, rural communities, and youth.
The workshop not only fostered the dialogue among multiple actors, including farmers, producers, policy and decision-makers, private sector and technological solution developers, researchers, academia, advisory services, civil society, and youth, but also raised awareness on the policies and national framework required for the digital transformation of Albania’s agriculture. Altogether, over 50 people participated. The two-day workshop created a basis for collaboration between the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy.
The term “e-agricutlure” was introduced by the United Nations’ World Summit on the Information Society in 2003 and 2005, whose goal was to lay the foundations of a people-centric, inclusive, and development-oriented information society where everyone can create and share information. Since then, the concept has evolved and digital agriculture has become more common.

Title: RYCO Project Steering Commitee: UN Albania committed to support youth initiatives in Western Balkans,
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
29 October 2020
RYCO Project Steering Committee Meeting took place on 27th October 2020 and was attended by representatives of UN RC in Albania, UNDP in Albania and IRH, UNICEF in Albania, UNFPA in Albania and EECARO, and RYCO.  The meeting aimed to share information about project implementation and its achievements, as well as to agree about the workplan for the forthcoming implementation period.
The UN project team, jointly with the project implemented partner RYCO, presented the project’s progress, as regards pushing forwards the peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts in the WB6, through activities organised with schools and youth organisations at regional level.
In her opening remark, the UN RC in Albania, Fiona McCluney took the opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the three UN agencies and of RYCO in making progress through this project during a challenging period influenced by force majeure, locally and globally. On behalf of the UN agencies, McCluney took also the opportunity to express the gratitude to the donor for the flexibility and support provided to the project, especially for the approval of a project no-cost-extension period, which is found crucial to conclude the project successfully. She reemphasised the commitment of the UN agencies to support RYCO in achieving its mandate, and  highlighted that working with youth in the WB6 region will be on the focus of the UN regional eligibility application to PBF.
RYCO’s Secretary General, Djuro Blanuša, highlighted the huge contribution of this project for RYCO’s organisational development. For Blanuša, it was fortunate for RYCO to be recognised by credible partners like UN from 2017 when RYCO was established as an institution, as it helped to diversify RYCO’s portfolio, grow drastically its presence in the region, enjoy political recognition and has a financially sustainable situation. He appreciated the flexibility and understanding of UN to respond to RYCO’s needs and to support RYCO to grow and realise its ambitions in making tangible change for youth in the region.
Resident Representative of UNDP in Albania, Limya Eltayeb, praised the collaboration of the UN agencies and RYCO in efforts to unpack the elements of peace, stability and security in a fragile regional environment. Mrs. Eltayeb, highlighted the importance of having a stronger regional perspective in such initiatives, which was found challenging in this project and could be a lesson learned to be taken forward in the future similar endeavours.  In a region with fragile economies, politics and social fabrics, an important message for PBF was to further support RYCO in testing, refining all the tools, methodologies and  policies developed in this project, and make them easily applicable in the WB6 region, with the final aim to see youth teasing out  the drives of tension and instability in the region. Mrs. Eltayeb reconfirmed the commitment of UNDP, to push these efforts forward through the regional eligibility application process.
Head of UNFPA Office in Albania, Manuela Bello, reconfirmed the commitment of UNFPA to work with grassroot youth organisations in fragile situation, as per the mandate of the organisation. She reiterated the need for further investments of PBF to work with youth peace and security in the WB6 region, by addressing the lack of trust, reconciliation and ethno-nationalistic rhetoric and actions. Mrs Bello emphasised that this project experience, has been a good start and it shall lead to more mature approaches in future similar interventions, and raised into attention of PBF the need to provide due considerations to this region and its complexities, in future funding opportunities.
UN PBF funded project of “Supporting the Western Balkan's collective leadership on reconciliation: building capacity and momentum for the Regional Youth Cooperation Office (RYCO)” commenced in October 2018 and is closing in November 7th May 2021. The project is a joint UN project, implemented by UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, with UNDP as the lead agency and the Regional Youth Cooperation Office (RYCO) as the implementing partner.

Title: One step further to a solid partnership with Food Heroes
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 October 2020
On 16 October, FAO and its national partners in Albania, including representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), MARD Extension Service, the private sector, academia and NGOs, convened for a virtual forum to celebrate the World Food Day (WFD), which marked FAO’s 75th anniversary. Building on this year’s WFD central theme Grow, Nourish, Sustain. Together, the forum emphasized the unprecedented importance of the joint multi-partner action in transforming food systems for enhanced food security, nutrition and poverty reduction in Albania, including in the context of the country’s recovery from the COVID-19 implications.
Recognizing the key role the Albanian smallholders and family farmers play in local food production and supply, which during the country-wide lockdown has become vital, the participants emphasized the growing need for enhanced multi-stakeholder cooperation and discussed concrete ways the extension services, private sector, academia and NGOs can contribute to strengthening farmers’ resilience to multiple evolving shocks by facilitating and diversifying sustainable agriculture-based livelihood options and coping strategies.
To this end, support to enhancing social protection and promoting more sustainable and efficient agricultural practices, including through the Extension and Advisory Service (EAS) systems, was stressed by Mr Arben Kipi, Assistant FAO Representative in Albania, among the Organization’s key priority areas in the country. Ms Fabiola Arapi, an adviser to the Minister of Agriculture and Mr Pjerin Shoshi, Director of Extension Service at MARD, informed the forum on the steps the Government is undertaking to enhance the existing national extension services to better support farmers in the COVID-19 situation.
Digital and e-commerce solutions, including Market Information System (MIS), received specific attention in view of the opportunities they offer to enhance connectivity between the actors along the value chain, improve farmers’ access to markets and consumers, and address the increasing demand, among all involved stakeholders, for timely and reliable data to inform decision-making. The participants shared their experiences from the past months in applying analytical tools and innovative data-driven approaches to support data generation and analysis, situation monitoring, information sharing and advice to farmers and agribusiness operators to cope with the negative effects of the pandemic.
The dialogue allowed to revisit challenges the food and agriculture sector in Albania is facing today and take stock of the available and emerging opportunities, including for promoting and scaling up Extension and Advisory Services and agricultural innovation. It also reiterated that to unlock these opportunities, enhancing multi-stakeholder coordination and partnership at all levels is key.

Title: UNFPA: A discussion about Youth Mainstreaming in Formal Policy-Making.

13 October 2020
- Young Albanians discuss with UNFPA Country Director for Albania
In the framework of UN75 dialogues in Albania and through a cooperation between RCO and UN Association Albania an interactive discussion (online) was organized. Conceptualized as an overarching discussion, focusing on “Youth Mainstreaming in Formal Policy-Making”, the event focused on three key areas: Assessing the needs of young key populations and other marginalized groups for achieving their effective inclusion and participation; reflecting on the engagement of youth in policy discussions at the local, national and international level; promoting youth agency and their priorities for sustaining peace in the ambit of SDG 16 and regional cooperation.
Twenty-two young Albanians from different walks of life engaged in discussion around these topics with UNFPA Country Director for Albania Nigina Abaszade. The participants dwelt more on understanding the importance of youth participation from different backgrounds particularly those from marginalized groups and vulnerable communities in formal political mechanisms as a vital part towards an inclusive society. These groups face increased discrimination and exclusion from decision-making processes during times of uncertainty such as a pandemic. To overcome this, young Albanians see the need for adequate access to information, services as well as support provided through the right approach by all government actors and international organizations. Additionally, throughout the discussion it was mentioned that another solution to this issue would be the introduction of youth quotas, however this seems to increase the segregation between these subgroups and the rest of society.
The discussion covered also youth participation in global decision-making processes with the participants acknowledging the need to act as an interest group, to self-organize and engage in policy-making and policy implementation regarding issues pertaining to sustaining peace.

Title: The ILO working with Albanian authorities to ensure safe return to work following lockdown measures
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
13 October 2020
- Important guidelines on safe return to work now available in Albanian language
Safe and healthy workplaces are essential for the containment of the spread of COVID – 19, for protecting workers’ and employers’ health and lives and for ensuring business continuity and therefore protecting employment and income, especially for the most vulnerable ones. In this context, the effective implementation and monitoring of the Red Protocols defined by the Government of Albania as well as the ILO Occupational Health and Safety (OSH) standards in the workplace in COVID times, has been at the focus of the interventions of the International Labour Organization  (ILO) in Albania following COVID outbreak.
The ILO in collaboration with the Albanian Occupational and Safety Center (AOSHC) and the State Labour Inspectorate (SLI) are conducting several training sessions with labor inspectors and COVID-19 Task Force in Durres and Elbasan, to capacitate the labour inspectors to effectively advise the business owners and administrators (from footwear and garment industry) on the importance of complying by the specific rules and regulations to prevent and mitigate the risks of COVID spread. The trainings are also highlighting the need for social dialogue at the company level for  effectively and efficiently addressing the issue of COVID-19 in the world of work.
The ILO has made available in Albanian and distributed locally 5 guidelines focusing on safe return to work and general workplace safety measures related to Covid-19.
The 2nd phase of this ILO OSH intervention at the workplace will be supported by SIDA and will focus on concrete support to garment companies (heavily dominated by women workers) in establishing the COVID -19 ILO standards at the workplace through a constructive social dialogue in the benefitting companies.

Title: ILO and Swedish SIDA together in empowering women against Covid-19
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
12 October 2020
- The intervention will support over 400 laid-off women workers who lost their job due to the COVID–19 pandemic and lack access to social protection
Thanks to the support of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the International Labour Organization (ILO) will help 400 laid-off women workers who lost their job due to the COVID–19 pandemic and lack access to social protection schemes.
The intervention targets the textile and footwear sectors and provides multiple services lines, including a major cash transfer operation for vulnerable laid-off women workers, in the amount of three minimum wages and social contributions. Other services include the access to ILO’s technical assistance for selected factories committed to implementing the ILO Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) standards and the GoA Red Protocols against COVID in the workplace to protect workers’ health and for a safe continuity of business operations.
Additionally, the project builds on the work and recommendations of the international working group – convened by the ILO – gathering employers, workers, retailers and major brands to address the already serious damage to the garment industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiative aims to mobilize sufficient funding to enable manufacturers to ensure business continuity, payment of wages, as well as income-support and job retention schemes to protect garment workers’ income, health and employment (more information here). Leveraging the ILO and European model of operating in a tripartite manner in the world of work, the project will be implemented in close collaboration with relevant employers’ and workers’ organizations and other labour market institutions.
Both projects are aligned with the ILO DWCP 2017 – 2021, UNDAF 2017 – 2021 and “COVID-19 Socio-Economic Recovery & Response Plan (SERP)”, which has been consulted with and submitted to the Government of Albania.

Title: UNODC supports the second training on treatment of persons with drug use disorders in Albania
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
02 October 2020
UNODC supported the organization of the second Universal Treatment Curriculum (UTC) walkthrough training workshop for 25 national professionals and academic experts from Albania and Kosovo*.
The training was facilitated by two certified national UTC trainers. The participants, who took part in the first training on drug dependence treatment and care covering modules 1-4 of the UTC programme in February 2020, went over modules 5-8 focusing on intake, screening, assessment, treatment planning and documentation; case management; crisis intervention and ethics for addiction professionals.
The aim of the training series is to reduce the significant health, social and economic problems associated with substance use disorders by building international treatment capacity through training, and so expanding the professional global treatment workforce.
The five-day walkthrough training was funded by the Drug Advisory Programme (DAP) of the Colombo Plan - Chilean Office and coordinated by the University of California San Diego. It uses the UTC training package, as the internationally certified compendium of the evidence-based services and information for the skill development of treatment professionals. This work is supported by the Government of the USA.

- Strategic action during autumn-winter season in focus
WHO Representative and Head of the Country Office in Albania of WHO, Dr. Bettina Menne met today with the Minister of Health and Social Protection Ogerta Manastirliu, to discuss the joint steps towards strategic actions against the Covid-19 pandemic for the autumn – winter season.
Calling the meeting very fruitful, Dr. Menne said that the cooperation between WHO and the authorities remain a key point to successfully implement strategic plans to defeating the pandemic.
Albanian authorities relied strongly on WHO guidelines for the protocols allowing for the re-opening of schools earlier in September. WHO advise and guidelines were used as well for the restarting of indoor activities on Oct.1st.
While the main national laboratories delivering testing for COVID-19 have at least doubled their capacities, WHO has played a key role to supply the necessary equipment and technology as well as training for the staff – either directly or through other donors. Additional support and training is continuing to being delivered according to documents that the Albanian Government has turned into strategic milestones of a consolidated cooperation.

Title: UN FAO Starts Project in Vjosa Basin to Support Farmers an Authorities in Sustainable Development
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
20 August 2020
Vjosa is the second largest river basin (approximately 6 808 km2) in Albania and one of the longest transboundary rivers in the Balkan area. The Vjosa catchment is shared among many cities, such as Erseke, Permet, Gjirokaster, Tepelene, Mallakaster, Fier, and Vlore. Because the waterway has not been subjected to large damming or channeling schemes, it is considered one of the rare remaining natural flow regimes in Europe, giving the Vjosa not only national, but also international importance.
FAO has now started a new project for the effective and improved management of Vjosa Valley’s natural resources, which will support farmers and authorities through sustainable development in the green economy and help achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 (life on land) and 13 (climate action). The project is financed by the SDG Acceleration Fund with contributions by the Government of Norway and contributes to FAO’s region-wide umbrella programme on managing natural resources sustainably, under a changing climate.
New approaches for the management of natural resources will be introduced with a strong focus on sustainable land use, improved soil fertility, and combating land and soil pollution and degradation. This will allow farmers, extension services, and institutions to better cope with the climate change impact on agriculture and disaster events.
To support agro-tourism and sustainable production and consumption in target areas, traditional local, organic, and geographical indications products will be identified and promoted through Climate-smart agriculture and Integrated Pest Management interventions, depending on the pandemic situation in Albania.
“Besides the above-mentioned activities, FAO will also collaborate with other United Nations agencies, under the lead of the United Nations Development Programme,” said Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative in Albania. “These will support environment and climate friendly initiatives in agrobiodiversity and rural tourism in Vjosa Valley-Zagori, among others, through knowledge sharing with similar successful initiatives implemented from other areas of Albania.”
The project will contribute to the implementation of Albania’s national strategy for the sustainable development of tourism 2019–2023, where Vjosa Valley-Zagori is one of the priority areas. It will also enhance the “Integrated Rural Development Program – 100 Village Program,” which coordinates multisectoral developmental interventions in 100 selected villages with a high potential development for socio-economic, rural, and agro-tourism, the environment and nature, as well as cultural heritage.
It is also aligned with the United Nations Programme of Cooperation for Sustainable Development 2017–2021.

18 August 2020
Addressing COVID-19 Challenges within the Migrant and Refugee Response in the Western Balkans
Today, the European Union (EU), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) launched a EUR 8 million project “Addressing COVID-19 Challenges within the Migrant and Refugee Response in the Western Balkans”, which is financed under the EU Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created extraordinary and unprecedented challenges for the EU, both in Europe and across the world. The EU has demonstrated its leadership and responsibility by putting together a collective, coordinated and coherent global response to the pandemic, bringing together EU institutions and Member States as “Team Europe”. At the core of the “Team Europe” approach, is a strong message of European solidarity with partner countries, as it is the case with this project.

The project, will help ensure that the rights of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees are protected and that asylum and migration management systems remain operational. It will contribute to mitigating the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the Western Balkans.

Covering Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo*[1],the project addresses the shortage of protective equipment for border police officials and personnel working in reception facilities or providing services to migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. In addition, it shall help prepare and train the responsible staff to respond to the COVID-19 challenges in adapting reception centers, scaling up sanitary infrastructure and providing basic services and hygiene items. The project will also promote and disseminate critical and factual information about the COVID-19 risks and measures in languages understood by the different communities, migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.

29 July 2020
-  A conversation with engaged youth
UNICEF in partnership with United Nations Association Albania, organized today a virtual Coffee Talk event centered around Youth Education. The informal discussion, part of the larger UN75 Initiative in Albania, gathered 24 young Albanians from 8 different cities, who joined the UN75 dialogue alongside UNICEF Representative in Albania. The participants exchanged views on the current situation of youth education in Albania and key issues that need to be addressed: equitable access to learning opportunities, improved learning skills for all and adaptability amidst fragile contexts.
The prominent role of UNICEF, as an organization who launched a “every child learns” development strategy - whereby an overwhelming focus was given to ECE (early childhood education) strategies -, as the basis of an inclusive and equitable future education, was widely discussed. Furthermore, other factors such as limited institutional capacity to plan, implement and assure quality at scale of early childhood education programs; limited coordination or/and coherence among partners at national or global level; were mentioned in order to further elaborate the progress of such campaigns.
The participants shared their personal experiences of the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic in education and stated the need for immediate investment in digital curricula and digital infrastructure in schools as well as the need for a strategy that leaves no one behind.

Title: Vodafone supports UN75 dialogue in Albania: Connecting for a Better Future
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
08 July 2020

The United Nations is being supported by Vodafone, one of the world’s leading technology communications providers, in helping the UN reach millions of people as marks its 75th anniversary at a time of great challenge.
As the UN continues its efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, it has launched UN75, an ambitious effort to crowdsource priorities and solutions for the future. A one-minute survey, Survey, sits at the heart of UN75, giving people a chance to make their voices heard. The survey asks people to share their priorities for recovery from the pandemic, and to imagine the future they want. The results will be presented to world leaders in September 2020, at the official commemoration of the anniversary.
Vodafone Albania is also supporting UN Albania to reach a many people as possible by promoting the initiative through Vodafone’s communication channels. The collaboration was announced by Vodafone Albania CEO, Achilleas Kanaris and UN Coordinator in Albania Brian J. Williams in an online meeting held on Wednesday.
Vodafone Albania CEO, Achilleas Kanaris said:
“We are happy to support such a great initiative on UN’s 75th birthday. UN is one of the most prestigious and long-standing partners in Vodafone and we share same views on the opportunities of a better future for the society. At Vodafone, we believe that a better and more sustainable future should be accessible to all, and that the vulnerable among us are not left behind on the journey towards that future. Vodafone is fully committed to using digital connectivity, services and solutions to that end. We are rigorously following our plans to build a digital society in Albania and also upskill the society to succeed in it. The recent health crisis, and the dire social and economic ramifications that have followed in its footsteps, is a harsh reminder of how much we all depend on each other, and that by coming together at local, national and international levels, we are stronger.”
UN Resident Coordinator in Albania, Brian J. Williams said:
“We are living in extraordinary times and the Covid-19 pandemic is teaching us that global challenges can be tackled and overcome only through global, coordinated action. It is absolutely great news that Vodafone Albania joins us to promoting UN’s largest global dialogue calling for all people’s opinions, suggestions and even criticism for the future we all want and the role of UN. As we want to give opportunities to all the people in Albania to have their say to the UN global peoples’ survey, teaming up with Vodafone means that more people who would otherwise not have a chance to make their voice heard will not be left behind.”
Vodafone Albania is using most of its communication channels to inform customers and Albanians on the importance of sharing their opinion and feedback in the survey, the insights of which will be core to the upcoming investment strategies of UN worldwide, including Albania.

Title: UNIDO’s new country programme 2020-2024 for Albania developed
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
30 June 2020
The global COVID-19 outbreak is putting an immense strain on societies and economies around the globe. Major disruptions are being felt in an already fragile world economy. Albania’s social and economic sectors are not an exclusion and being severely stricken by the pandemic. Although on June 1st, Albania removed all domestic restriction to travel and most businesses are now reopen, the containment measures have already started impacting the country’s economy through decreased manufacturing production, trade volumes and investment flows. Moreover, after the reopening, new infections have spiked, with the number of active cases and victims more than doubling.
Accordingly, structural shifts are urgently required to combat the aftermath of this socio-economic crisis. In this context, based on the request of the Government of Albania, UNIDO formulated a Country Programme (CP) for Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID) in Albania for the years 2020-2024. The overall objective of the UNIDO CP for Albania is to strengthen the Government’s effort towards sustainable and inclusive growth through dedicated projects in three selected thematic areas / components: 1) Industrial competitiveness and market access; 2) Productive employment and entrepreneurship development and 3) Sustainable energy for productive use and environmental management.
Based on the extensive discussions, UNIDO experts and national ministerial counterparts have developed 20 prospective project proposals that have a potential to change the industrial future of Albania. The Programme was officially signed in Vienna in March 2020. Despite the fact that the CP launching event in Tirana was postponed, in connection with the COVID-19 crisis and prevailing travel restrictions, the CP has entered its inception phase whereas priority projects will be identified by the Government and development partners for further fine-tuning, fund mobilization and adaptation to the national socio-economic situation challenged by the COVID-19 outbreak.
At the same time, the current state of emergency stimulates the humanity to reconsider how we conduct ourselves as a global community and provides a unique chance to experiment with cooperation approaches to establish new partnerships that could lead to a safer and more sustainable future.
Against this backdrop, UNIDO joins the response efforts of the G20 and the United Nations system in particular. The Organization is actively refocusing and repurposing its functions, in order to better contribute to common crisis response actions and to help its Member States to build back better. UNIDO has been regularly publishing  analytical materials on a wide range of topics around the COVID-19 and industrial development, such as the COVID-19 Industrial Recovery Programme Brochure, Guidance for micro, small and medium enterprises business recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,  or a comprehensive publication on Digital Transformation and Industrial Recovery.
In April 2020, UNIDO released a position paper containing the Organization’s response framework and titled “Responding to the crisis: Building a Better Future”. The paper presents a new approach to combating the crisis that includes three integrated packages called “Prepare and Contain”, “Respond and Adapt” and “Recover and Transform”.
As UNIDO’s position paper outlines, an integrated service package “Prepare and Contain” will include measures to diversify the manufacturing capacity of Member States and to protect their productive sectors and workers, particularly the most vulnerable ones. Concrete actions under this service package will include assessment of the impact of the outbreak on national industrial trajectories, assistance with industrial risk management and emergency plans formulation, market assessments for automotive, agro-food, textile & apparel, electronics and other sectors, investment analysis and provision of information on innovative business sector initiatives, facilitation of partnerships to address pandemic impacts on critical sectors and many more.
Further, the paper indicates that the “Respond and Adapt” service package will allow Member States to assess possibilities of re-purposing manufacturing capacities towards production of soft medical equipment, while promoting targeted inclusive and environmentally sustainable solutions. Concrete actions under this service package will include promotion of business innovation through adoption of digital solutions on MSMEs, diversification of supply and distribution chains through new tools and e-learning modules, provision of adequate quality infrastructure services, assistance with medical waste management equipment installation and assistance in production of generic medicines through increased access to technology and investment.
Looking beyond the crisis, the paper outlines that UNIDO’s service package “Recover and Transform” will help Member States recover and transform in an inclusive and sustainable manner. Since the actual scale of the economic downturn is still unknown and a quick rebound from the crisis appears unlikely, UNIDO’s holistic service package will include such actions for sustainable economic recovery, as support with socio-economic diagnostics and execution of structural transformation plans, assistance to private sector to revitalize activities and generate jobs for women and youth, forging partnerships in innovation and Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), accelerated development of products/treatment protocols in the biopharma and medical sectors, and use of AI/Big data for product performance prediction.
In the Albanian context, UNIDO is ready to provide assistance based on the Republic’s needs to enable the country to adjust to the “new normal”, which could be characterized by structural shifts towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), clean energy and low carbon solutions, and circular economy.

Title: Inauguration of premises to accommodate vulnerable asylum-seekers at the Social Center ‘Motrat Qiriazi’ in Erseka
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
25 June 2020
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the NGO Caritas Albania – under the auspices of the Ministry of Interior and the Municipality of Kolonja - have jointly held an inauguration ceremony for premises at the recently refurbished social center in Erseka. The event is being held in line with World Refugee Day 2020, which was commemorated globally on 20 June. The inauguration was leaded by Mr. Dhori Spirollari. Prefect of Korca District and have been done in presence of Mr Erion Isai, Mayor of Kolonja Municipality, Ms. Ana Verushi, Head of the Regional Council of Korca District, who have received the refurbished premises, and Mr. Brian Williams, United Nations Resident Coordinator.
The refurbished premises will serve to benefit the local population and will also accommodate vulnerable individuals who arrive in the country at the south-eastern borders, seeking asylum. This may include women at risk, unaccompanied and separated children, or survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.
The refurbished premises will offer vital temporary shelter and services for the most vulnerable asylum-seekers, pending the transfer to other more permanent reception facilities. According to data from UNHCR and partners, 27% of the refugees and migrants arriving so far this year have been women and children, and 74% have been from countries facing conflict, violence or human rights violations. The refurbishment at Erseka is in line with previous investments by the government of Albania, IOM and UNHCR to increase such capacity in the border regions.
UNHCR Representative to Albania, Pablo Zapata said: UNHCR remains engaged in supporting governmental policies and efforts to adequately shelter asylum seekers, such as in the Erseka Social Centre that is being inaugurated today, where they will be able to receive specialized services according to their needs. Persons hosted in this Centre will receive here the first specialized services according to their needs, a first step to integrating and contributing to the country’s development.

Title: Stopping sexual violence: An OpEd by the UN Albania Country Team
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
09 June 2020
The recent cases of sexual abuse, including that of an adolescent in the capital city and in the Shkodra Police Commissariat, caused widespread indignation among Albanians. Any form of sexual abuse against a minor is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights, with devastating consequences in terms of individual suffering. The rally that took place in Tirana and other cities last week gave voice to people’s disbelief in ways that was considered unprecedented by many. Thousands of mostly young protesters took the streets to say ‘Enough!’ with patriarchy, rejecting the notion to live in a society that perpetuates violence, abuse and discrimination, and justifies violence against women, girls and children. Albanian youth are asking for justice, accountability, and respect for human dignity. Those are the values they want to see their country shaped by for the years to come. They chanted ‘You are not alone!’, reaffirming their determination to be agents of change.
Last week’s events could mark a new beginning in the fight against sexual abuse and gender-based violence. But how can we make sure not to miss such opportunity? What is the direction to follow? According to recent data, at least one in two women in Albania have experienced some form of violence, including domestic or sexual violence, harassment, non-partner violence, forced marriage, and stalking. Data from INSTAT shows that 26% of women aged 18-74 believe a woman should be ashamed to talk to anyone if she is raped, while 21% believe that if a woman is raped, she probably did something careless to put herself in trouble.  60% of sexual crimes are committed against children, with nearly one in two suffering from physical or psychological aggression. Evidence also reveals a strong correlation between child sexual abuse and gender-based violence in adulthood.
Violence can be eliminated, but it requires systemic responses. To obtain long term gains, this ‘shadow pandemic’ should be addressed in its entirety and complexity, by prioritizing four strategic approaches.
First, securing leadership and accountability: the Parliament, the Government and the Judiciary must prioritize violence against children and gender-based violence; the overall ‘machinery’ to promote gender equality and children’s rights must be-sufficiently empowered and resourced to lead the response through coordinated action across sectors. Political leadership is important, including through the National Councils on Gender Equality and on Child Rights and Protection. National institutions should drive action, monitor progress and adjust course, learning from success and failure. This includes better coordination with local actors: mayors and local councils, the police and the courts, Coordinated Referral Mechanisms, school masters, and social workers. They all are at the front line of action and must be able to fulfill their responsibilities.
Second, greater investments are needed to secure full application of existing laws. Albania has made significant progress in bringing its legal framework in line with key international normative standards, although additional criminal and administrative amendments are still required in relation to sexual violence, sexual harassment and stalking. Moreover, this is the time to step up implementation and make the full menu of services readily accessible to all those in need. This includes legal aid for survivors, timely enforcement of protection orders, functioning emergency shelters, health and psychological counselling, social protection, housing and income opportunities, and more. Existing referral pathways are still largely underfunded and understaffed. Few municipalities can call on full time domestic violence coordinators, for example, civil society efforts are under-resourced, the LILIUM centre needs additional support, child protection workers often lack background and training, and support helplines are not fully funded. Poor implementation contributes to low levels of trust in the system, leading victims to remain in the shadows.
Third, there should be a redoubling of efforts to foster education, awareness and dialogue. ‘It is not your fault’ and ‘Educate your sons’ were some of the key messages of the recent youth protests. They are very revealing of the direction in which the country needs to prioritize its efforts. The system’s failure to protect children allowed those responsible to protect to become abusers. Albanian men and boys continue to uphold stereotyped gender roles, yielding a vicious cycle of aggressiveness. As feminist writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie put it, ‘Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage’. In parallel to helping Albanian boys realize that true men are feminists, helping girls become fully aware of their worth is crucial to fight harmful stereotypes that prevent them from realizing their full potential in adulthood.  We need whole-of-society engagement. Schools can lead the way in fighting patriarchal values, mobilizing students, parents, care givers and community members in conversations around human rights, child protection, sexuality education, masculinity, girls empowerment and self-defense, and use of social media.
Fourth, public information and communication play a massive role in eradicating the culture of sexual violence and abuse. Media power should be channeled to support survivors, not perpetrators. The media can be part of the solution, providing space for public debate, giving voice to Albanian youth who are determined to challenge the status quo, while it continues to report on implementation of relevant laws and policies. At the same time, the application of existing norms and codes of conduct to protect the privacy of survivors cannot be stressed enough. Recently published information revealing personal details of victims should not be tolerated, especially in the case of children.
Discrimination and violence will not disappear overnight. But if action in the four areas indicated above is boosted, we can see meaningful change. The UN in Albania is supporting public institutions and civil society to promote a safe environment for women, boys and girls, at home, in schools, at work, in public and private places. The UN family will also continue to promote action and dialogue on issues that are central to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the EU integration. The forthcoming revision of important milestones of the national policy agenda, such as for example the National Strategy for Development and Integration, as well as the National Strategy for Gender Equality, and the National Agenda for Children’s rights, offers an opportunity to provide concrete meaning to such dialogue and exchange. There is much to do ahead of us. We stand ready to play our part.

Title: Joint statement by UNICEF and UN Women against sexual abuse of children
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
02 June 2020
UNICEF and UN Women are very concerned by the recent news of another case of sexual violence against an adolescent girl. While sexual violence committed against anyone is a crime, we are particularly worried about the intensity with which it affects women, young girls and children. This constitutes a gross violation of fundamental human rights and bears long-term devastating impact on the victims and their surroundings.
We call on institutions to fully investigate such crimes, establishing a culture of zero tolerance for sexual harassment and abuse. Women and girls must feel safe in the spaces where they learn, live and play. We also call on the media to stop reporting details on the identity of survivors and their families. Public information and communication should help eradicate the culture of sexual violence, and use its power to fully support survivors, not perpetrators.
Most importantly, we call upon all society to not turn its back on those who were affected by this violence, to stop blaming them, and to stand against abuse. There is no justification, no excuse, no tolerance to rape!
Albania has made significant gains in protecting children from violence, including by endorsing key human rights instruments. Their full implementation, today more than ever, is fundamental to guarantee that all women and children are protected against all forms of abuse and exploitation. The gains made so far must not be reversed. UNICEF and UN Women in Albania will continue to support the work of public institutions and civil society organizations to promote a safe environment for women and girls, where they feel empowered to live safely and are supported when needed, with sex offenders systematically reported and brought to justice.

Title: UN Country Team Albania Statement on the demolition of the National Theatre building
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
19 May 2020
The United Nations Country Team in Albania has noted with concern the tension caused by the demolition of the national theatre in the early hours of Sunday morning 17 May. The UN in Albania underlines the importance of strengthening national unity of purpose and building trust between authorities and the population, particularly while managing the Covid-19 pandemic. More than ever, extra efforts to ensure dialogue, transparency and extra time to ensure full consistency with the rule of law can help mitigate risks associated with actions that might disrupt national unity. The UN in Albania notes the importance of the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, in accordance with the law and good democratic practice.

Title: Covid-19: UN Resident Coordinator Brian J. Williams interview for Diplomaticus at News24
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
14 May 2020
Diplomaticus Talk Show  at News24, 14 May 2020
Interviewer Erion Kacorri
Interviewer: Welcome to our weekly programme Diplomaticus. Over 4 million people have been affected and more than 285,000 have lost their lives due to the new coronavirus COVID- 19 that hit the world. What are the economic and social consequences expected to affect the world and our country? For that, l have invited the UN coordinator in Albania, Mrs. Brian James Williams. Mr. Williams thank you very much for being here.
W: Thank you for having me!
Interviewer: Ms. Williams, what is the role of UN in such unprecedented crisis?
W: I mean, the UN has a big role to play of course all over the world. Really trying to accompany governments and help governments learn about what’s going on. As we all know from watching the news, COVID is something brand new, so we’re learning about it every day. The scientists all over the world are trying to study it, the UN is trying to capture this information and provide it back as quickly as possible to governments so that the governments have an idea about what to do. And then of course, it’s the whole family of agencies, and these agencies all over the world are doing everything they can. They’re providing food, they’re providing health care, they’re thinking about the education needs, they’re thinking about the regular communities that they work with and how to make sure these communities are not overly impacted by COVID or how to mitigate those impacts. So, really everywhere the UN is doing quite a bit.
I: How do you see the trend of the pandemic in Albania?
W: Here in Albania, I think we should congratulate the authorities and the Albanian people for really having reacted quite quickly. In those early days, in March, when no one had been found yet with the virus here, there was a lot of effort to look for it. Once it was confirmed, once there were some cases confirmed, the government reacted quite quickly. The lockdown measures here were fast and strong, and I think we see the positive results of that in the data. There has never been here in Albania explosive growth. Okay, there have been some days when the number has a little bit higher, maybe even in 20s, but if you look at the whole time since the beginning of March, it’s pretty flat. And really, the government deserves credit for that. Now, we know there are big economic impacts that come from the lockdown. You know, it’s a very blunt broad measure and it’s time - and the government is thinking - about how to open up slowly as many other governments in Europe are. Managing this next phase will be really tricky. There is a lot that we should be paying attention to in this next phase.
I: When you say next phase, what do you mean?
W: Well, so already today here in Tirana, and across Albania there’s more stores open, next week there’ll be more. We know that tourism is so important to Albania and we know there’s going to be a lot of pressure to open up a little bit - some different industries, restaurants, bars, coffee shops; [there are] so many informal workers that are not necessary covered by some of the relief programs. The economy needs to get going again. With the economy opening up a little bit, it means people are going to start mixing again, and the question is “How do you manage that movement of people getting back to work, traveling back to their offices, going more often to a restaurant? How do you do that, in a way that minimizes the opportunity for the virus to jump from person to person. At the end of the day, the enemy here is a small virus that you can’t see and our behavior is going to have to change a little bit. We can’t just go back to normal as if nothing ever happened. We are going to be going to restaurants where people are more spread out. Public transportation is going to be less used. I know there’s been new bike lanes popping up in Tirana, that’s a good thing. People are going to have to be more thoughtful about how they use public transportation. People should wear masks, frankly, not because you protect yourself, but because you protect everybody else if you wear a mask. So somehow, managing this opening up is really important. It’s important that if there is somebody infected in this new phase, that that person is found quickly and that all the contacts of that person are found quickly and that you close down any emerging cluster of infections.
I: Mr. Williams, how do we get back to where we were before the breakout of this pandemic, and how do we overcome the social-economic damage caused by COVID-19?
W: So, getting back to where we were before, the pre-situation, will not happen until we have a vaccine. So, until we have a vaccine or until we have very effective drugs to treat the illness, until then we are going to have to adapt out behavior as I said. I think what is really important is that we continue to think about how to support workers who are really dependent from week to week on that income to make sure that their families, you know, can eat and continue to prosper. So, we’re going to have to take some of these social distancing measures. I think social support measures are going to also be required for a longer period of time. In many countries, they’re talking now about a kind of a universal basic income. Really what that means is a social protection floor. How do we make sure that every family in Albania has the minimum amount of resources, to make sure of course they can feed themselves, they can send their kids to school, they can make sure their kids have school books and everything that’s necessary, they can buy the economic inputs they need if they’re agricultural or if they’re farmers, you know, they need to have enough liquidity that they can buy the inputs for their farm. So, we really going to have to look sector by sector and do an analysis about how the new environment, how does requiring to be socially distanced or physically distanced, how does that affect my business. I know the Minister of Tourism, for example, has said that of all the hotels and tourist facilities are going to have to have a COVID  coordinator. Somebody whose job it is to think through: okay in my business, in my hotel, in my restaurant, in my beach, what do I have to do to make sure that my clients are safe and am I providing information to my workers? How do the workers protect themselves? How do the workers protect their clients? So, to go back to you question, there is not going to be a new normal tomorrow. Maybe, there will be a normal such as we remember it next year; but for the rest of this year, we’re all going to have to behave differently. It’s going to have everybody to play their part.
I: Can we be positive for the future?
W: Of course, we can be positive! I mean, you know, as humans we are creative, we are inovative, we are also caring. I mean, take a look at what the world has done over the last 8 weeks. Its extraordinary! I mean, the amount of resources that governments have found, whether it is in Europe, whether it is in United States, the resources found to support payments to make sure that people can still eat and pay their rent. Its extraordinary! So, when there is a big crisis in front of us, we find ways to respond to it, and I’m optimistic that we are going to find ways to respond to this one as well. We are already seeing that in different countries. But it is going to be different. So, I’m positive, yes, but it’s going to be different, and it is going to require individuals to behave differently, it’s going to require governments to rethink a little bit their priorities. There is no question here, as everywhere, that health systems are going to need more work, because the health system is going to be under strain from COVID until the end of this thing. So, we should all be - and this government too - investing more in the health system, so it is stronger and it can continue to provide the regular health service that everybody needs, even while it’s keeping an eye on the COVID situation.
I: Mr. Williams, the UN Secretary General, António Guterres is talking about racism, hate speech and xenophobia fueled by the pandemic. What is Mr. Guterres exactly talking about?
W: He’s really worried. You know, in every crises, there is sometimes a temptation, and some people begin to look for a cause, a blame, and it’s so easy in this kind of situations, in different countries around the world to blame somebody else. The reality is this virus is a virus. It is not a person, it is a virus. Our world is so interconnected today. We already knew that. We knew that a pandemic was likely to happen. Experts have been thinking about pandemics for decades, and how to prepare for it. So, this is not entirely unexpected. What the virus shows is that we are an interconnected world. Nevertheless, sometimes it happens that some groups or some individuals try to blame, you know, an immigrant or a certain sector of their society as being the problem.
I: Or a country.
W: Or even a country. The Secretary General said “Look, this is a virus and the way to combat this virus is by working together and being supportive of absolutely everybody and making sure that, you know, it is not about blaming, it’s about working together to combat”.
I: Mr. Williams, United Nations appealed for 6.7 billion dollars to fight coronavirus pandemic in poor countries. According to the United Nations, there is evidence of incomes plummeting and jobs disappearing, food supplies failing and prices souring. What does the UN aim for through this fund?
W: You know, globally, the United Nations has three main strategies, or three main pillars. The first is what we call humanitarian assistance, and this is the 6.7 billion that you are referring to. It’s an appeal for the poorest countries in the world to make sure that those countries, the citizens have enough to eat and that basic services can continue. This is really for the least developed countries. This second pillar is healthcare specifically. And in every country, the World Health Organization, but also other UN organizations involved in healthcare are helping health systems to respond and you know, it’s not just COVID response, but is also like immunizations for example. We need to make sure that kids are still getting immunized against measles and other childhood diseases. Otherwise, we are going to end up seeing more problems from health problems that we know already. So, we need to continue with strong health systems. The third pillar is what we call socio-economic response. In here, we’re looking at a variety of measures, social protection floors as I was mentioning, maybe universal basic income, also looking at jobs. So, jobs is a big one, right? Here in Albania, a lot of UN programs are working with municipalities to make sure that the most vulnerable people somehow don’t get left behind. So, you know, we have some joint programs, they have provided food and hygiene kits to more than one thousand five hundred families, working with municipals governments to help them identify which of their citizens are the most at risk. Maybe it’s the Roma and Egyptian communities that do not have such good access to services. Maybe it’s people with disabilities. I mean a lot of families that have kids with disabilities for example, they can't have access to programs, the therapeutic programs they normally support their kids. Well, they’re getting support from the UN, so the parents are getting online coaching so, you know, through Zoom, the parents are getting coaching about what kinds of exercises for their kids so that those kids, at least, continue to get some kind of support. So, this socio-economic pillar is about jobs, maybe for all of those unemployed informal workers for the moment, we should be thinking about some short-term vocational training. Let’s take advantage of this opportunity. We need to support these people anyway, maybe we can put them into some vocational training of some kind so that we come out on the other end of this in a better position.
I: Mr. Williams, according to the United Nations, the virus will have most destabilizing and devastating effects on the poorest countries. Do you expect such crisis to hit Albania as well?
W: Well, for sure Albania is going to get hit hard by COVID, as all countries in the region are, there is no question about it. We know how important truism is for Albania, so we need to find a way to figure out how to support some tourism, and to take care of all those people who normally live from the tourist industries. For sure, we are not going to see the same kinds of numbers of tourists this year as we’ve seen in the other years, that’s for sure. Of course, we want to support a maximum number of those that can be done safely, but we also want to find ways to support those informal workers who so far maybe have not benefited yet from any programs. We want to find ways to support those informal workers. So, that is going to be an impact. I think regional cooperation is really important, too. So, you know, Albania also exports a lot of agricultural [products]; well that requires open borders, that requires supply chains to work, that means there is a lot of front workers and customs and at borders that need to make sure that trucks of tomato or whatever, can pass through the border. So, Albania is going to be affected. We know that the Government is putting together a kind of economic recovery program and on the UN side, we’ve also have been instructed, every country around the world, whether UN programs has been instructed to put together a kind of socio-economic program. We’re going to be working with the government to make sure that our program is supporting theirs, of course. But there is going to be impact. It is important, it is not going to be back to normal next months.
I: Does UN in Albania have information that people here have lost their jobs during the pandemic?
W: The government here has information that people have lost their jobs. So, we know that there has been a pretty high impact in terms of people who are not going to work anymore and we need to get those people back to work as quickly as possible and we should be thinking about other ways to engage those who might not get a job right away but we should be finding some other way; vocational training, for example, or maybe some other public works programs that give them some short term opportunities to at least help bridge the period until, hopefully, next year, you know, there’ll be a full tourist recovery.
I: Mr. Williams, you have stayed in Albania during the pandemic. How did this whole process of working from home and the phased return work? How do you see all this process?
W: I think in Albania, as well as elsewhere in the world, working from home actually worked better than most people expected. You know, even this morning, I was in a call with some of the other embassies of the European Union Delegation and the Prime Minister and minister Ahmetaj and everybody was on Zoom. You know, everybody was doing the same thing. So, actually we’ve been able to do quite a bit that way. What you can’t do is really get out into the communities as easily as before. So, all those bits of work that require going out and meeting groups of people is much harder than before, but not impossible. Even in training for example, the World Health Organization here in Albania has done a lot of work training health workers, nurses and other front-line medical staff through Zoom, or whatever, about ok what is COVID, what  are the symptoms, how do you respond to those symptoms, how do you wear protective gear, what kind of protective gear do you need. I mean, you can only imagine the amount of training that is going on everyday as we learn more about COVID, and you know, most of that training has been done by Zoom or equivalent.
I: Of course. Mr. Williams, one last question; Albania was hit by a major earthquake in November. What is United Nations doing to support the post-earthquake recovery in this country?
W: Yeah, I mean, poor Albania, right. We thought one disaster was enough and then we got another one. I think the government and ourselves as well are trying to stay focused on the earthquake and I would say that even over the last 10 days there has been a lot of renewed attention to this, as people start to feel a little bit more comfortable, at least with the lockdown phase of COVID. We are going to be working with European Union on school reconstruction, with the UNDP, with some cultural heritage reconstruction with UNOPS. UNDP and FAO are looking at economic recovery in the earthquake zone. UNICEF is looking at how to support the soft side of education in earthquake zones, so that how can teachers be better prepared so that if an emergency happens, you know how can they respond; online education is something that is important when your school is not accessible like because of the earthquake, or your school is not accessible because of COVID. So, online education and distance education, UNICEF has been doing a lot of work with the platform called “Academia.al” to respond to that to make sure kids continue to receive an education. So, we’re still focused on earthquake response, working with a number of different partners and in some ways some of that reconstruction work is helpful for the economy actually, so it's good that we get it started quickly.
I: Well, Mr. Williams, thank you very much for the interview.
W: It’s my pleasure! Thanks for having me!
I: Honorable viewers, thank you for your attention. See you next week. Please comment  on our Facebook account.  You can watch our program on YouTube. Goodbye!

Title: A new normal: UN lays out roadmap to lift economies and save jobs after COVID-19
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
27 April 2020
New York, 27 April 2020 – The urgent health crisis that is COVID-19 has created a historic recession with record levels of deprivation and unemployment, creating an unprecedented human crisis that is hitting the poorest hardest, especially women and children. In a new framework released today as a roadmap to support countries’ path to social and economic recovery, the United Nations calls for an extraordinary scale-up of international support and political commitment to ensure that people everywhere have access to essential services and social protection.
The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”  calls for protecting jobs, businesses and livelihoods to set in motion a safe recovery of societies and economies as soon as possible for a more sustainable, gender-equal, and carbon-neutral path—better than the “old normal”.
“This is not only a health crisis but a human crisis; a jobs crisis; a humanitarian crisis and a development crisis. And it is not just about the most vulnerable. This pandemic shows that we are all at risk because we are only as strong as the weakest health system. Its unprecedented scale demands an unprecedented response,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who presented his report on the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 “Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity” in March.
“Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and the many other global challenges we face,” he said. This new framework released today sets the way United Nations entities will deliver this vision on the ground.
Decisions made in the next few months will be crucial for the progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN’s framework for social and economic recovery stresses.
Noting that during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, more people died from the interruption of social services and the economic breakdown than from the virus itself, the framework focuses on protecting the needs and rights of those most affected by the pandemic, starting with the most vulnerable countries, groups, and those who risk being left behind.
Drawing lessons from the 2008-2009 global economic and financial crisis, the framework notes that countries with strong social protection systems and basic services suffered the least and recovered the fastest. To prevent billions of people from sliding into poverty, governments around the world will need to rapidly adapt, extend and scale-up safety ‘cushions’, such as cash transfers, food assistance, social insurance schemes and child benefits to support families.
For the impacts of COVID-19 to be reduced, the UN calls for an extraordinary scale-up of support to cope with the challenges ahead, including immediate social protection responses that consider differentiated impacts on vulnerable groups, children, women, men, and those in the informal sector. This is particularly urgent considering that 4 billion people, more than half of the world population—including two out of three children—have no or inadequate social protection.
NOTES FOR THE EDITORS
The UN will focus on five key streams in its response, which places communities at the centre of recovery efforts: 1.protecting existing health services and strengthening health systems’ capacity to respond to COVID-19; 2. helping people cope with adversity, through social protection and basic services; 3. protecting jobs, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and informal sector workers through economic recovery programmes; 4. guiding the necessary surge in fiscal and financial stimulus to make macroeconomic policies work for the most vulnerable and strengthening multilateral and regional responses; and 5. promoting social cohesion and investing in community-led resilience and response systems. These five streams are connected by action to meet the need for environmental sustainability, if countries are to recover and “build back better”, and be better prepared to address future shocks, including pandemics.
UN teams covering 162 countries and territories will rollout this recovery plan in the next 12 to 18 months, under the leadership of UN Resident Coordinators (RC), supported by a network of global and regional expertise. As the technical lead in the socio-economic recovery efforts, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) will support RCs, with UN teams working as one across all aspects of the response.
While a significant proportion of the existing US$17.8 billion portfolio of sustainable development programmes across UN entities will be adjusted towards COVID-19 needs, given the scale and scope of the socio-economic impact of the pandemic, additional funds will be required. To support these efforts, the Secretary-General launched the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, a UN inter-agency fund mechanism to help support low- and middle-income programme countries overcome the health and development crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and support people most vulnerable to economic hardship and social disruption. The financial requirements of the Fund are projected at $1billion in the first nine months and will be subsequently reviewed. The Secretary-General also called for a multilateral response that amounts to at least 10 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) to mount the most effective response to crisis the world has ever seen.
There will be no return to the “old normal”, the framework document states. The pandemic is a blow to developing and emerging economies that already face binding constraints of debt and limited fiscal space, with several developing countries needing urgent debt relief. Its impacts will be especially devastating for the most vulnerable countries – those in humanitarian or conflict settings. The UN also calls for a massive fiscal and financial repurposing in the next weeks and months, including the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies to aid the response. The UN stresses that the status quo and business-as-usual are policy choices, and they are not inevitable. For a sustainable development that benefits more people, the choice must be for a recovery from COVID-19 that is fast, fair, green and inclusive.
About the framework document : The “United Nations Framework for the immediate socio-economic response to COVID-19: Shared responsibility, global solidarity and urgent action for people in need”, released today puts in practice the UN Secretary-General’s Shared Responsibility, Global Solidarity report on the same subject. It is one of three critical components of the UN’s efforts to save lives, protect people, and rebuild better, alongside the health response, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the humanitarian response, as detailed in the UN-led COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan. Three funding mechanisms support the comprehensive response pillars: The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, managed by the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for the immediate health needs; the  “Global Humanitarian Response Plan” for the humanitarian appeal; and the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for the socio-economic recovery.
About the UN Development System: The United Nations development system is the world’s largest international actor on social protection and basic services. The UN System is present in 162 countries and territories and reaches tens of millions of people through basic services, social transfers and other forms of social protection. The UN Development System has extensive experience in supporting governments in developing social protection systems including social protection floors and delivery of quality social services and to support such services across humanitarian and development contexts. unsdg.un.org

Title: UN Albania message on gender-based domestic violence in the context of Covid-19
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
10 April 2020
As the fight against the COVID-19 continues, self-isolation and lockdown increase the risk of domestic gender based violence. In times when the home becomes the ultimate safe haven for the population, this is not the case for victims of domestic abuse: they are confined under the same roof with their perpetrators, they struggle to receive help from their families or social networks, and they fear that reporting violence could put them in greater danger. They become even more vulnerable.
Since the outbreak of the epidemic we have continued to receive information about cases of domestic violence in Albania. Maintaining undisrupted access to protection and social support is essential now. Referral mechanisms must remain functional and provide the full range of services prescribed in the law. Protection orders should be issued any time there is danger, and fully implemented, including by having the perpetrator leave the home instead of the victim.
If you - or anyone you know – feel in danger, call the national hotline 116 - 117, or the police 129.

Title: Statement by the UN Country Team in Albania on the situation surrounding the COVID-19 breakout
Content: Albania Progress Report 2022
10 March 2020
UN Country Team in Albania is following closely the situation of COVID-19 breakout and is working with health authorities through the World Health Organization (WHO) country office in Albania.
The situation requires from all citizens to follow the guidance provided by the health authorities.  Particular attention must be placed on respecting hygiene advice and contact health emergency number 127 in case of concerns.
The measures that have been taken by the government are necessary to contain the spread of the virus.
In this situation, with the first COVID-19 cases confirmed in Albania it is normal for people to worry but as long as the advised measures are applied there is no reason to panic.
Following the WHO guidance, UN Albania advises the following:
Be informed: It is very important that people have all the necessary information about the disease and how the virus is transmitted and how it can be contained.
- WHO information on COVID-19 (English): https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019
- Information from Ministry of Health Albania (Albanian/Shqip): https://shendetesia.gov.al/koronavirusi-i-ri-dhe-masat-ndaj-tij/
Be careful: Be careful but do not panic. Protect yourself, your family and others from getting infected and if you have fever and cough contact the health authorities to get support.
Be alert: Use the information that you have received to prevent taking unnecessary risks that can expose you to the virus.
Be kind: Be considerate and kind with other people. No one wishes to be infected but if this happens be supportive and empathic to another people’s situation. Everyone’s rights must be respected.  At the same time make sure that all protective measures are taken.
