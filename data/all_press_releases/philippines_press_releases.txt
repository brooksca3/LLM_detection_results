Title: UNSGSA Queen Máxima to visit the Philippines to support scaling up financial services for better financial health
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
17 May 2024
MANILA, PHILIPPINES — May 17, 2024 — H.M. Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development (UNSGSA), is scheduled to visit the Philippines from May 21-23, 2024. The visit will focus on advancing key foundational building blocks for financial inclusion—including connectivity, digital identification, and digital payments—as well as enhancing financial health and resilience against economic and climate-related challenges for Filipinos.
In recent years, the Philippines has seen considerable progress in financial access, with the proportion of adults owning a bank account rising from 26.6% in 2011 to 51.4% in 2021, as reported by the World Bank Global Findex. However, despite these gains, the Philippines remains still has approximately 37.6 million unbanked adults.
The Findex data also highlights significant concerns about financial resilience among Filipinos. The primary financial worry for 42% of adults is covering medical costs in the event of a serious illness or accident, followed by concerns over managing monthly expenses (24%) and securing funds for old age (17%). The urgency for improved financial health has been underscored by the pandemic, with 68% of adults very worried about facing severe financial hardship.
Throughout the visit, Queen Máxima will recognize recent developments in digital ID implementation and digital payments systems while engaging with public and private sector leaders to discuss support for their expansion. Digital ID can help people access safe and secure financial services such as digital payments. The visit will also highlight the need for more affordable financial services, crucial for the archipelago's many small islands.
During the trip, the UNSGSA will conduct field visits in Manila and its surrounding areas to hear firsthand from financial services users about innovations that significantly impact their lives, especially those enhancing financial health. Queen Máxima will visit a fisherfolk community to explore last-mile financial solutions that address the unique challenges present in remote island settings. The Special Advocate will also learn about a tech-enabled platform that empowers small ‘sari-sari’ (which means retail shop) store owners to grow their businesses, digitize their operations, and integrate into larger supply chains.
The agenda further includes high-level meetings for the UNSGSA with figures such as President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., Secretary of the Department of Finance (DOF) Ralph G. Recto, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Dr. Eli M. Remolona Jr., and other key policymakers and leaders. These discussions aim to foster partnerships and support continuous innovations in the financial sector. Queen Máxima will also meet with Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Masatsugu Asakawa to explore collaborative opportunities at a regional level.
Additionally, a focus group discussion with a diverse contingent of female financial users will provide insights into how financial products can effectively address the needs of women and enhance their financial health. Another highlight of the visit will be a demonstration of the Co-Develop’s South-East Asia Center for Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) at Ateneo University.
Throughout her visit, Queen Máxima will emphasize the critical role of financial services in enhancing economic prospects and quality of life for all Filipinos, particularly those in underserved communities. By sharing insights and forging connections between global financial initiatives and local realities, the UNSGSA visit aims to inspire continued progress and innovation in the Philippines’ financial sector.
The UNSGSA will be supported by some of her Reference Group members, including the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), the Better than Cash Alliance, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), and the World Bank.
The UNSGSA previously visited the Philippines from June 29 to July 1 in 2015.

Title: The Philippines, KOICA, UN agencies launch 2 mobile health clinics to reduce adolescent pregnancies in Samar, Southern Leyte
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
17 May 2024
TACLOBAN, 16 May, 2024 – In a significant step towards improving adolescent health and curbing adolescent pregnancies in Eastern Visayas, the United Nations, and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) turned over two adolescent-friendly mobile health facilities that will be offering free medical services to Samar and Southern Leyte provincial governments.
The mobile health facilities, dubbed TrucKABATAAN, are part of the Joint Programme on Accelerating the Reduction of Adolescent Pregnancy in Southern Leyte and Samar in the Philippines, a collaborative effort supported by the Korean Government through KOICA, in partnership with the Philippine Government, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Health Organization. The programme is estimated to potentially benefit 275,000 adolescents.
"Reducing teenage pregnancies is a key goal for the Philippine government - a goal that the United Nations and our partners are committed to help achieve by mobilizing knowledge, resources, and opportunities to better enable youth in the Philippines to reach their full potential. These mobile health facilities provide accessible health services that are key to empowering young people,” said Gustavo Gonzalez, United Nations Philippines Resident Coordinator.
This program comes in response to the pressing issue of adolescent pregnancy in the Philippines, which has been declared a national priority. While the Philippine Statistics Authority reported a slight decline in teenage fertility rates nationally (from 8.6% in 2017 to 5.4% in 2022), the number of adolescent mothers aged 10-19 continues to rise, particularly those in the worrying younger age bracket of 10-14.
“I would like to remind everyone that KOICA stands with you in safeguarding and improving adolescent health and well-being. This year, we are celebrating the 75 years of Philippines-Korea diplomatic relations and the 30th anniversary of KOICA in the Philippines. These historical occasions give us the momentum to intensify our assistance to the country. We assure you that KOICA will continue to strongly support you for a realized comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights of Filipino adolescents and reduced adolescent pregnancies,” said KOICA Country Director KIM Eunsub.
Besides being one of the Philippines’ poorest and most typhoon-battered regions, the 2021 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study showed that Eastern Visayas, where Samar and Southern Leyte are located, has one of the highest rates of 15 to 19-year-old female youths that had begun childbearing. The regions had the highest percentage of female teenagers who were currently pregnant at the time of the survey.
“Over the past years, we have implemented various programs, projects, and strategies aimed at reducing adolescent pregnancy in the region. With the Universal Health Care Act, all stakeholders have been diligently working and putting in every effort and system in place to fully implement and realize Universal Health Care in the region. While there is still much to be done, we are making significant progress. Today, we are one step closer towards our goal of ensuring that every Filipino has equitable access to quality and affordable healthcare services. Through this mobile clinic, we will be bringing essential health services directly to the doorsteps of our young people. From sexual and reproductive health education to maternal and child health services, TrucKABATAAN will provide comprehensive support tailored to the unique needs of adolescents,” said Eastern Visayas Center for Health Development Regional Director Exuperia B. Sabalberino.
The partners are working closely with the Department of Health, the Department of Education, and the governors of Samar and Southern Leyte, as well as other government agencies in rolling out adolescent-friendly services through the TrucKABATAAN, building the capacity of community adolescent health service providers, accelerating the integration of comprehensive sexuality education in schools, implementing youth leadership and governance initiatives, and conducting research on adolescent pregnancy and child, early, and forced marriage.
"Pregnancy can be a beautiful journey, but for adolescents, it should not be part of their journey! Adolescence is a crucial time for personal growth, education, and development, and pregnancy can significantly disrupt these processes. The health-related risks are real! Adolescent mothers face higher risks of medical complications during pregnancy and childbirth compared to adult women. We must ensure access to quality healthcare and education to protect their health, prevent complications, and empower them to reach their full potential,” said UNFPA Philippines Country Representative Dr. Leila Saiji Joudane.
Adolescent pregnancy can result in anemia, sexually transmitted infections, unsafe abortions, postpartum hemorrhage, and mental health disorders. It can also exacerbate maternal undernutrition, resulting in low-birth-weight infants and childhood stunting. This perpetuates a cycle of malnutrition across generations.
“All adolescents have the right to good health and well-being. Investing in adolescents’ health builds strong economies, inclusive communities and vibrant societies. Adolescent-centred approaches such as these mobile clinics put young people at the heart of the solution and give them opportunities to access key services and participate meaningfully in their communities,” said UNICEF Representative to the Philippines Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov.
“We must strengthen and sustain our collaboration to effectively prevent adolescent pregnancy. Adolescent pregnancy is a public health concern that requires whole-of-society efforts that involve families, service providers, schools, faith- and community-based organizations, policymakers, and youth. We hope these mobile facilities will be able to bring services much closer to those in need at any time, anywhere,” said Dr Rui Paulo de Jesus, WHO Representative to the Philippines.
The program aims to bridge the gap in access to quality healthcare services for adolescents, particularly those residing in remote or underserved areas. A medical team will travel with the mobile clinics, visiting young people aged 10-19 in at least 20 local government units in Southern Leyte and Samar. They will provide:
Among the features of the TrucKABATAAN are:
The local government will also provide a driver, administrative staff, a medical team composed of a doctor, nurse, midwife, medical technician, social worker, and peer educator.
Young people from Eastern Visayas last year co-created the trucks’ exterior design and recommended features to make it appealing to their peers.

Title: The UN calls for increased support for climate resilience in the Philippines as drought wreaks havoc
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
25 April 2024
MANILA, PHILIPPINES. The international community is behind the Philippine Government as it faces a serious drought induced by El Niño. The Climate Crisis Coordinator for the El Niño / La Niña Response, UN Assistant Secretary-General Reena Ghelani and the UN Resident and Humanitarian coordinator in the Philippines, Gustavo Gonzalez urged for increased support to the Government response. This call was made at the end of the visit of the Climate Crisis Coordinator for the El Niño / La Niña Response in the Philippines.
The current El Niño episode, one of the strongest in history, is causing dry conditions and high temperatures across South-East Asia. In the Philippines, 41 provinces are experiencing drought and nearly 31 others are facing dry spells or dry conditions. More than 1,400,000 people have been affected and the upcoming harvest will likely be below average. The Government, with support from partners, has put in place a national Task Force, headed by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, to prepare for and mitigate the worst impacts of the crisis on water, food security, health and energy.
The UN and humanitarian and development partners have been actively preparing for and responding to El Niño in the Philippines in support of the Government's El Niño relief efforts. In 2024, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Oxfam Pilipinas activated their Anticipatory Action programs in the north, Isabela, and the south of the country, the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, to provide immediate support to affected communities before the effects of drought are most felt. Early last year, the World Food Programme (WFP) worked with the Government and communities to build ponds and small reservoirs to ensure water sufficiency and food security in pre-identified areas affected by El Nino. Likewise, private sector's collective action is being monitored by the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF). The majority of the sector's support is aligned with food and water security.
"The Philippines demonstrates the importance of acting early before a disaster strikes. With more frequent and severe climate shocks, it is crucial we strengthen our support to community resilience", said Reena Ghelani.
One of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, the Philippines is highly exposed and vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Recent estimates showed that climate change could cost the Philippines over 7% of GDP by 2030. Disasters have already cost US$ 23 billion in damages to the country since 1990.
"Building resilience to address shocks like El Niño/ La Niña is at the heart of the new UN Cooperation Framework signed with the Government last year. The UN Country Team is presently recalibrating such technical assistance as part of the Enhancing Resilient Communities flagship initiative. The visit of the UN Coordinator is very timely as climate-related investments are needed more than ever," underscored Gustavo Gonzalez.
During her week-long mission to the Philippines, Reena Ghelani met with the Government's National Task Force on El Niño, the Humanitarian Country Team, the Philippine Red Cross and other partners. She interacted with communities affected by El Niño and women's groups engaged in strengthening community resilience. She also visited a climate-resilience housing project and spoke with local authorities and civil society organizations.

Title: Philippines joins UN Global Accelerator aiming to expand jobs and social protection
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
19 April 2024
Fostering a job-rich economic recovery and extending social protection are the goals of the UN’s Global Accelerator initiative, to which the Philippines is joining as just one of 15 pathfinder countries.
The inter-ministerial Social Development Committee (SDC), chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has confirmed its commitment for this programme to facilitate just transitions towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The interest from the Philippines highlights the alignment of the Global Accelerator objectives with the country’s development frameworks, particularly the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) and the Philippine Labor and Employment Plan (PLEP) for 2023-2028, said Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma of DOLE. These frameworks have been reinforced by the Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TPB) Plan whose inter-agency council shall be the national steering committee in implementing the roadmap/s under the Global Accelerator. “These underscore as a priority the creation of employment opportunities and that is where support from the new initiative will be crucial,” he said on behalf of the SDC.
The Global Accelerator will support pathfinder countries like the Philippines to align national policies, close gaps and channel investments for social impact. It will help address coverage and financing gaps for universal social protection, create decent work, protect communities from climate change and other risks, and facilitate just transitions initially in the construction and transport sectors. With its potential to make a real difference in the lives of millions of people around the world, the Global Accelerator will also enhance multilateral cooperation for joint implementation, said Gustavo Gonzalez, the United Nations Resident Coordinator for the Philippines.
“The Philippines’ participation as one of the Pathfinder Countries in the Global Accelerator will maximize UN support to bolster the country’s efforts to ensure full, decent and productive employment for every Filipino,” he said. “This global initiative has great potential to fast-track the realization of development objectives.”
The engagement process with the Global Accelerator started in 2023 with various national consultations that included international financial institutions, UN agencies, development partners, government agencies and other partners. On 28 February 2024, the Global Accelerator was presented to the Social Development Committee at the Cabinet level, which endorsed the country's engagement in the initiative.
The International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), will actively support the Global Accelerator in the Philippines.
Following the official commitment, the Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TBP) Inter-agency Council will serve as the National Steering Committee. The council will support the design and implementation of the national development roadmap and foster collaboration among the actors involved, including workers and the private sector. The national roadmap will set the direction and the entry points of the Global Accelerator in the Philippines.
The Philippines has already joined the Global Coalition for Social Justice, a UN-breaking initiative to reduce inequalities, promote decent work and advance social justice.

Title: UN, PCW, SM Cares kick off Women’s Month with exhibit, illumination of malls
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
01 March 2024
To kick off Women's Month, the United Nations Philippines, Philippine Commission on Women and SM Cares are collaborating on a series of events to champion women's empowerment.
SM Malls Illuminate for Women's Month
In a gesture of solidarity, participating SM malls across the Philippines (North EDSA, Aura, Mall of Asia, Megamall, Cebu, Lanang in Davao) will illuminate their buildings’ facade purple for March 1. From March 1 to 31, select LED assets inside and outside the participating malls will also feature a short video with key messages for Women’s Month. The video will play at prominent locations such as SM Megamall, SM MOA Arena, SM Mall of Asia Arena Annex (MAAX) Eye, SM Seaside City Cebu, SM City Clark, SM North Edsa, SM Fairview, and SM Sto.Tomas, as well as on digital directories in SM malls nationwide.
"Walk In Her Shoes" Traveling Exhibit
An interactive traveling exhibit dubbed "Walk In Her Shoes" will be displayed on the 3rd floor of SM North on March 1st. This compelling showcase features narratives from women and girls, shedding light on different forms of gender-based violence they experience. The exhibit strives to raise awareness about the widespread nature of violence against women (VAW), encourage reflection on harmful social norms, and inspire collective action to end VAW.
“Significant progress has been made in empowering women and girls, but the promise of gender equality remains unfulfilled for far too many, especially those from vulnerable groups. To achieve our goals for a just and equitable world, we must decisively increase investment in women, especially their health, education and overall well-being," said United Nations Philippines Resident Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez.
Gonzalez thanked the Philippine Commission on Women for leading efforts to empower women and for SM Cares and SM Supermalls for providing the space and platform to raise awareness about gender inequality and gender-based violence.
"Gender equality demands a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach. Only through collaboration across sectors can we dismantle harmful norms and build a world where women and girls enjoy the same rights and opportunities as men,” he said, adding that gender equality also has economic impacts as it results in sustainable development.
The PCW shares that the Philippines ranks 16th globally with a 79.1% parity score. It stands as the second-best in East Asia and the Pacific and remains the sole Asian nation within the top 20. But the reality remains, if this pace goes on, we may not live to see the day where women are treated equally as men, on all fronts. Hence, the Commission calls on everyone to double down on efforts towards gender equality.
One way of sparking conversations on women’s rights is the Purple Your Icon advocacy initiated by the Philippine Commission on Women as part of the annual National Women’s Month celebration. This encourages everyone to light up or decorate their offices, landmarks, and places in purple.
PCW Officer-in-Charge Atty. Khay Ann Magundayao-Borlado extended the agency’s gratitude to SM Supermalls for joining this campaign by lighting up different malls in purple across the country and the UN Philippines for being one of its steadfast partners in this advocacy.
“Adorning our surroundings this month serves not only as a beautiful tribute, but also as a powerful symbol. Purple signifies the spirit of women's rights, highlighting the fight for equality and empowerment. It represents a future where limitations and stereotypes are transcended,” said Atty. Magundayao-Borlado.
SM Supermalls, through its social responsibility arm - SM Cares, champions women's empowerment, health, and welfare. The company strives to build a future where every woman feels valued, respected, and empowered to reach her full potential.
This commitment extends far beyond a single month, emphasizes Atty. Pearly Joan J. Turley, SM Cares Program Director for Women and Breastfeeding Mothers. "By collaborating with organizations like the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and United Nations, we actively ensure compliance with RA 11313 or the Safe Spaces Act (Bawal Bastos Law) by conducting mandatory orientation sessions for our own employees, agency personnel, and tenant employees to foster a safe, inclusive, and empowering environment for everyone visiting our malls."
Recognizing that investing in violence prevention is critical, SM encourages other groups to join the effort in building a safer, more inclusive and equitable society.
Among the United Nations Gender Thematic Group (UN GTG) agencies that contributed to the “Walk in Her Shoes” exhibit are UNFPA, UN Women, UNICEF, UN Development Programme (UNDP), International Labour Organization, World Food Programme, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

UNFPA Philippines works with its partners in empowering women by (1) advocating for policies that protect women’s and girls' right to make informed choices about their bodies, (2) addressing gender-based violence and harmful practices by challenging discriminatory norms and strengthening response mechanisms for GBV survivors, and (3) ensuring the protection of women in humanitarian settings through supporting the provision of essential reproductive healthcare and gender-based violence support systems.
Call to Action
The public is encouraged to visit the "Walk In Her Shoes" exhibit at the SM North’s City Center Level 3 from March 1-10, and to engage with the Women's Month illumination campaign at participating SM malls nationwide. “Together, let's create a world where women and girls enjoy freedom from violence and discrimination.”

Title: What we know so far about effective prevention of violent extremism
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
12 February 2024
UNRC Op-Ed on UN International Day to Prevent Violent Extremism

Today, 12 of February, we observe the International Day for the Prevention of Violent Extremism as and when Conducive to Terrorism. The declaration of this day stems from a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, and it aims to raise awareness of the threats linked to violent extremism and to enhance international cooperation to address this complex and multidimensional issue.
Violent extremism is neither new nor exclusive to any region, nationality or system of belief. No country or region is immune from its impacts. In 2019 alone, violence and conflict inflicted an estimated $14.4 trillion blow to the global economy — equivalent to 10.5 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) or $1,895 per person.
Threats or risks of terrorism deter investments – a 5% fall in net Foreign Direct Investment position of the country, say experts , diverting resources from economic and social programmes to the security sector.
While there is consensus that violent extremism and terrorism negatively impact development, not all of us have the same understanding of strategies, approaches or instruments to combatting them. Governments have the primary responsibility of ensuring security, respecting human rights, upholding the rule of law and countering discrimination, exclusion and marginalization. Civil society organizations are often well-placed, knowledgeable, and experienced in identifying and addressing the grievances that make individuals more vulnerable to radicalization and violent extremism, leveraging their expertise and community connections. Experience also shows that private sector actors also have unique capacities—and resources—that can make them strategic partners for Governments.
A frequent term used by policymakers to describe the collective investment needed to fight violent extremism is the “whole of society approach”. However, this convenient shortcut risks oversimplifying the complexities of social dynamics, internal division of labor, roles, responsibilities, power imbalances and exclusions. Governments and civil society organizations must overcome stereotypes from each other and collaborate professionally, with clear delineation of roles and responsibilities. Governments are expected to provide civil society and private sector stakeholders with the legal and political space they need to engage with those vulnerable to violent extremism. Civil society is expected to give critical feedback to government actors, including when officials overstep or fail to fulfill their duties. Police and other security forces are expected to avoid instrumentalizing civil society organizations to gather criminal intelligence and detect threats within communities. Antagonistic approaches – and I can refer to my own professional experience — do not bring the desired results; on the contrary, they exacerbate existing divisions, limit information flows which would allow governments to address grievance through peaceful means and weaken much needed social trust.
As we are learning, violent extremism is not only to be combated, but it also can be prevented. And this is the most interesting and complex part of the “whole of society approach”. Radicalization doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s not a spontaneous phenomenon of history that can easily discharge us from any responsibility. The alienation of a high number of youths, who join terrorist organizations doesn’t happen overnight. And the causes cannot just be reduced to a lack of income or employment for youths, as we sometimes oversimplify in our forums. Understanding and addressing the root causes of violent extremism and terrorism requires, in many cases, a critical historic analysis in addition to genuine discussions with youth and others at risk of radicalization.
So far, we know that the inability of a society to engage youths in meaningful ways and to provide opportunities for individual fulfillment of political, social, economic, cultural, religious aspirations, risks exacerbating preexisting gaps and frustrations that can be easily exploited by violent-ideology organizations.
Preventing violent extremism requires a comprehensive, long-term investment encompassing education, institutional behavioral changes and prioritization of early warnings and anticipatory actions. National budgets are good indicators to assess if prevention is a political priority for a given administration. We have to also admit that prevention, as a long-term project, does not always attract the interest of political short-termism.
We are also learning that terrorism is becoming a fluid and amorphous phenomenon that combines military non-State armed groups, organized crime networks, engaged in a wide range of illicit trafficking from small arms and light weapons to the latest security and communication technology. In addition, not all terrorist-induced violence is linked to armed conflict. We experience the emergence of powerful software tools that can spread and distort content instantly and massively heralds a qualitatively different, new reality. Violent extremism and terrorism have also an evident gender dimension. Women and girls are continuously and often disproportionately affected by acts of violent extremism. It’s not a surprise that gender inequality and misogyny are central to the propagation of violent extremism.
The adoption in 2016 of the UN Secretary General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism provided a comprehensive approach to addressing the underlying conditions behind violent extremism conducive to terrorism. ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, were among the first in the world to adopt their own regional Plan of Action in 2018.
Cooperation between the Government of the Philippines and the United Nations in preventing violent extremism and terrorism has significantly increased in recent years. The United Nations Office of Counterterrorism (UNOCT), the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have been leading technical assistance in such sector, assisted by many other UN entities to ensure holistic and integrated support to the country. I am glad to confirm that our new 2024-2028 UN Development Cooperation Framework, signed with the Government on 24 October last year will enhance such partnership with a strong prevention and resilience building approach.
Prevention and sustainable development are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. In this context, full achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals remains critical, both in their own right and because sustainable development is ultimately the only way to comprehensively address the interlinked, multidimensional drivers of violence and insecurity.

Title: NOTIFICATION: Scams for soliciting money, implying association with United Nations agencies
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
14 December 2023
Fraudulent schemes using the names of United Nations agencies are spreading across the Philippines. These include the use of photos from United Nations activities and personnel, and derivative logos made to closely resemble official branding of United Nations agencies to obtain money from individuals and communities, particularly in rural areas of Mindanao and in the Visayas.
The United Nations NEVER charges any fees from partner communities at any stage of project implementation, nor in procurement or recruitment processes.
We wish to warn the public of these scams, where “fees” or “investments” are collected by fraudsters falsely claiming association with and using images of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP).
Do not be fooled: People involved in these fraudulent activities may present realistic-looking identification and documents to support their claims, which promise funds or other benefits, such as livelihood and humanitarian assistance, employment opportunities, and interest-free loans.
Suspicious communications or proposals purportedly from, for or on behalf of the FAO, IFAD, and WFP — or any other United Nations entity — should immediately be reported to philippines@un.org, or through the following channels:
• FAO: abuse@fao.org | fao-ph@fao.org
• IFAD: abuse@ifad.org
• WFP: philippines.feedback@wfp.org | 0917 528 9392 (Globe) or 0947 896 5091 (Smart)
Victims of such scams are strongly encouraged to immediately reach out to local authorities for assistance.
The United Nations reports fraudulent schemes to local law enforcement for appropriate action. We appreciate the public’s help in bringing misleading practices that harm the people in the Philippines to our attention.

“Walk in Her Shoes” Experiential Exhibit in support of the 18-Day Campaign to End Violence Against Women (VAW) at the Philippine Senate
4 December 2023
MANILA – The United Nations (UN) Gender Thematic Group (GTG), in partnership with the Office of Senator Pia Cayetano, launched on Monday an experiential exhibit dubbed “Walk in Her Shoes” in support of the 18-Day Campaign to End Violence Against Women (VAW).
The exhibit, which will be open to Senate visitors from Dec. 4 to 12, features stories of various sectors of women and girls, highlighting the forms of gender-based violence they face daily. It aims to raise awareness about the pervasiveness of VAW, prompt reflection on the prevailing social norms that reinforce this harmful behavior, and galvanize action to end VAW.
"Violence against women is a persistent, widespread, and worsening global crisis that demands immediate action. It is rooted in structural injustice and fueled by a male-dominated culture that denies women equality. Together, we must invest in prevention, support survivors, end impunity, and promote women's leadership to create a world free from violence against women,” said Dr. Leila Joudane, Country Representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and chair of the UN GTG.
Among the UN GTG members that contributed to the exhibit are UNFPA, UN Women, UNICEF, UN Development Programme (UNDP), International Labour Organization, World Food Programme, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and Food and Agriculture Organization.
“The ‘Walk in Her Shoes’ exhibit is a creative and impactful way to raise awareness about gender-based violence and encourage action to end it,” she added.
"Through this exhibit and other means like social media, we must work together to raise public consciousness and action in order to protect women and children from becoming victims of violence in their own homes, communities and even online,” said Senator Pia Cayetano.
As a strong advocate of women’s rights and gender equality for nearly two decades, Senator Pia Cayetano has championed legislation to safeguard women and children from various forms of violence. These measures include: Magna Carta of Women (RA 9710); National Consciousness Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women & Children (RA 10398); Anti-Rape Law, as amended (RA 11648); Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (RA 10364); Anti-Photo and Video Voyeurism Act (RA 9995:); Children’s Emergency Relief and Protection Act (RA 10821); and the landmark Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act (RA 10354). Through the support of Senator Cayetano, the exhibit is easily accessible to legislators and policymakers, who play a crucial role in creating an enabling environment for women and girls to realize their full potential.
Joudane said the UN agencies under the GTG are committed to supporting the Philippine government’s efforts to end VAW. Through its programs, the UN ensures that the rights of women to live a life free from violence are at the forefront of its work. This includes UNICEF supporting child protection centers, strengthening child protection in emergencies, and leading the SaferKidsPH initiative to prevent online sexual abuse and exploitation of children. WFP empowers women and tackles gender-based violence by weaving gender-responsive approaches into food aid, aiming to build resilience and challenge harmful norms.
The ILO is also strongly advocating for the ratification of ILO Convention 190 (C190) to end violence and harassment in the workplace. The Senate has moved closer to concur this first international landmark treaty that recognizes everyone’s right to a workplace free from harassment and violence, including for Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs). It also has various development cooperation projects like Safe and Fair (SAF), Ship to Shore Rights, and Improving Worker Rights in Rural Sectors focusing on the protection of migrant women workers and those in the rural sector.
UN Women supports national and local government agencies in adapting and institutionalizing policies and mechanisms that provides for services and enables duty bearers deliver on their work to address and eliminate GBV through supporting localisation of ordinances, sensitizing responders including law enforcement agencies, supporting CSOs and creating platforms for stakeholders to work together including wide public awareness across various platforms.
Meanwhile, UNFPA fights gender-based violence on multiple fronts: (1) shifting harmful norms through comprehensive sexuality education and multi-sectoral work, (2) building strong systems by collaborating with government agencies and organizations to ensure access to comprehensive, survivor-centered services in response to GBV, even in crises and online spaces, (3) empowering young leaders by equipping youth with tools and resources to raise awareness, prevent GBV, and champion gender equality.
“Walk in Her Shoes’ is a call to action to understand the situation of women and girls as they navigate a society that often puts them at risk of violence. The exhibit, which was also displayed at the United Nations office in Mandaluyong from Nov. 24 to Dec. 3, encourages visitors to put themselves in the shoes of these women and girls and understand the challenges they face.
It also aims to open a discussion with policymakers and decision makers on effective strategies for prevention and response to gender-based violence.
Gender-based violence is a global pandemic that affects one in three women and girls worldwide. “It is a violation of human rights and a barrier to achieving gender equality and sustainable development,” said Joudane.
Based on the 2022 Philippines National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), 18% of Filipino women who had a husband/intimate partner report having experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence by their most recent intimate partner. But of the women who experienced gender-based violence, 2 out of 5 did not seek help.
After the 18 Days Campaign, the UN GTG plans to bring the exhibit to different public spaces throughout the Philippines to reach a wider audience and to advocate for joint  programs that address VAW.
“The fight against GBV requires a whole-of-society approach. By uniting, we amplify our impact and become a formidable force in combating VAW and GBV,” Joudane said.
About 18-Day Campaign to End Violence Against Women
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence is an international civil society-led campaign that commences on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. This year, the 16 Days campaign theme is Invest to Prevent Violence Against Women & Girls. It calls upon United Nations networks, civil society, organizations and institutions to step up and support different prevention strategies to stop violence from occurring in the first place. In the Philippines, the 16 Days of Activism is extended to 18 Days until December 12, the anniversary of the signing of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children.

Title: UN convenes forum on ethical use of AI
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
01 December 2023

30 NOVEMBER 2023, MANILA The United Nations in the Philippines yesterday convened national stakeholders in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) to discuss the ethical use of this rapidly developing technology to accelerate sustainable development.
Recognizing both, the tremendous potential and risks brought about by AI systems, UN in the Philippines initiated the consultative process to assist the Philippines with the assessment of preparedness to utilize AI, using the internationally agreed AI Readiness Assessment Methodology, developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as part of its implementation of the 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of AI. This comprehensive readiness assessment supports Member States in maximizing the benefits, while mitigating the risks of developing and using AI technologies.
In the Philippines, yesterday’s forum serves as a foundational step in setting up a network of experts that can provide guidance to develop and harness the power of AI for good and ensure that its transformative impact is inclusive and rights-based.
“If we unlock the immense possibilities of AI, we have the responsibility to ensure that these are aligned with the principles of fairness, accountability, transparency, and promoting and respecting human rights and dignity,” said Gabriela Ramos, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences, in her virtual address to the forum.
To preface the discussion, UNESCO presented its Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, a document that outlines key values, principles and strategies on AI use, which was adopted by 193 Member States in 2021. UNESCO also shared its Readiness Assessment Methodology, an instrument to help countries understand where they stand on the scale of preparedness to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all their citizens.
This emphasis on ethical frameworks for AI addresses potential and existing issues, including concerns that barriers to accessing the technology intensify social and economic disparities. Algorithms have also been shown to amplify bias and discrimination, facilitate the spread of disinformation, and heighten the risk of data privacy violations, among other safety and security-related challenges.
“AI technology is evolving faster than we can imagine. This is why we must better understand the ethical implications of this revolutionary technology,” said Gustavo Gonzalez, United Nations Resident Coordinator in the Philippines. “Today we are setting up a network, a community, to contribute to the conversation on the  efficient and responsible use of AI in the Philippines because. If not well-managed, digital innovations can exacerbate existing inequalities.”
At the global level, the UN Secretary-General formed in October 2023 the High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, which will identify key opportunities to leverage AI for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), create a shared understanding of the technology’s risks and challenges, and recommend international governance initiatives.

Recommendations on AI governance will be taken up at the Summit of the Future, a high-level event which will be held in September 2024 where world leaders will discuss existing international commitments and take concrete steps to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities.
The National Stakeholders Roundtable on Ethical AI was organized by the United Nations in the Philippines and sponsored by UNESCO, UNIDO, UNOPS.

Title: HCT JOINT PRESS STATEMENT: Commemorating the 10th Anniversary of Super Typhoon Haiyan
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
08 November 2023
Today we commemorate the 10th anniversary of the devastating impact of Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), which struck the Philippines on 8 November 2013, resulting in over 6,300 deaths and the displacement of several thousand families. Over 16 million people were affected in 41 provinces across nine regions.
We remember the lives that were lost and disrupted and extend our gratitude once again to the Philippine government and humanitarian partners for their support and collaboration, which played a crucial role in efforts to assist those affected by the super typhoon. The response efforts also involved the private sector, civil society, and even the support of overseas workers and foreign militaries, truly embodying a whole-of-society approach under the leadership of national authorities.
In the immediate aftermath of the storm, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) helped coordinate the assistance provided by international and national partners between November 2013 and August 2014 through these efforts:
Since then, various partners and organizations have collaborated to expand humanitarian efforts in the Philippines in support of the government-led response, particularly on healthcare, protection, and food security.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has helped effectively address both communicable and non-communicable diseases in affected regions, benefiting approximately 5.8 million people.
On maternal care and reproductive health, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) played a central role in delivering essential services and supplies, as part of a comprehensive plan developed in partnership with the government and other humanitarian partners to provide urgent care and protection to 3.5 million women and girls of childbearing age.
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, co-led the Protection Cluster with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to address the protection concerns of Super Typhoon Haiyan internally displaced population, focusing on vulnerable groups such as children, women, the elderly, and indigenous communities. Core relief items were also provided in affected areas.
UNICEF put the needs of children and youth at the center of its response by providing access to safe water, vaccinating children against diseases, providing learners and out-of-school youth with education materials and safe spaces, delivering psychosocial support, and training service providers, among others.
Action Against Hunger’s programs focused on addressing hunger through the provision of emergency food aid, cash grants, and livelihood assistance, while also improving access to safe water and sanitation.
The World Food Programme (WFP) collaborated with the Philippine government and partners to enhance local emergency response capacities, emphasizing the importance of quick, localized responses to ensure food security and nutrition during climate events.
The International Organization for Migration co-led the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Cluster and worked with DSWD to address the most urgent needs of over 5,000 families who lived in displacement sites across 5 areas. Like many others, IOM’s response extended beyond initial response with the deployment of the Displacement Tracking Matrix, staff training on CCCM and Disaster Risk Reduction.
UN-Habitat's response empowered families to build 810 resilient permanent housing in various localities in Region 6 and Tacloban City which have withstood various typhoons until today through the People’s Process while also assisting Tacloban City, Ormoc City and Guiuan municipality in developing their Recovery and Rehabilitation Plans.
After the immediate response efforts, HCT members continued to provide support. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched an early recovery program that focused on restoring livelihoods, restoring local institutions and public services for recovery, and reducing risks for future disasters. The program included rapid employment efforts and cash grants for affected businesses. UNDP also provided climate resilient and gender sensitive evacuation centers, and resilient permanent housing for displaced families.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been working towards the adoption of anticipatory action interventions linked with existing social protection systems and programs to help ensure food security and the protection of agricultural livelihoods among vulnerable communities even before disasters strike.
This focus on pre-emptive response was echoed by Plan International Philippines, which highlighted the necessity of preparing communities for predictable hazards, particularly to ensure inclusivity and child-friendly policies. The organization highlighted the importance of mainstreaming gender transformative actions during emergencies.
Oxfam Pilipinas also called for proactive disaster mitigation and preparedness through collaborative solutions and emphasized the impact of the climate crisis on marginalized communities.
Following the devastation wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan, the HCT has learned that when humanitarian needs outpace available resources, the significance of prevention, anticipatory action, community engagement, and resilience building becomes clear. This forward-looking approach improves responses to current and future challenges and requires stronger collaboration among organizations to implement long-term strategies. It also aims to decrease dependence on immediate humanitarian aid and empower individuals to address challenges independently, preserving their dignity and self-sufficiency.
To enhance the humanitarian system in the country, the HCT is taking part in the three-year initiative "Enhancing Resilient Communities (ERC),” which aims to leverage Filipino expertise, bridge the gap between humanitarian and development sectors, involve communities in decision-making resilience building, and foster alliances for shared goals to better prepare for future climate change scenarios. The ERC focuses on community engagement, cross-sector partnerships, and learning from community practices to improve disaster relief and response systems to increase climate resilience.
“Today, we commemorate the resilience and strength of the Filipino people, who have rebuilt their lives and communities in the face of adversity. We must continue to learn from the lessons of Haiyan to better prepare for future disasters made even more challenging by climate change. Together with the government, we are committed to investing in disaster risk reduction and innovative solutions such as anticipatory action and to deepening our collaboration in building a more resilient Philippines,” said UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez.
The HCT invites our partners, government, and civil society to recommit to stand ready to serve communities with a steadfast and united response when it is needed. With climate change exacerbating extreme weather events, we stand in solidarity to ensure that our efforts prioritize inclusivity and sustainability, placing the most vulnerable at the forefront of our work so that no one is left behind in disaster response and recovery.

Title: Karen Davila named UN Women National Goodwill Ambassador for the Philippines
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
03 November 2023
27 October 2023, New York. Award-winning journalist and advocate Karen Davila is UN Women’s new National Goodwill Ambassador for the Philippines. The announcement was made during a recent visit of Ms. Davila to UN Women Executive Director, Sima Bahous, at the agency’s headquarters in New York.
Ms. Davila, a broadcast journalist, television news anchor, radio presenter, and longstanding advocate for women’s and children's rights, will work to inspire change, and draw attention to the role of women in development and nation building, promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment.
She said: “It is an honour to be UN Women’s first National Goodwill Ambassador for the Philippines. I will be working with many others who speak out in support of UN Women to help bring about positive change in mindsets, behaviours, and hopefully, in the everyday lives of women and girls.”
Welcoming Ms. Davila’s appointment, Alia El-Yassir, UN Women Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific said: “The Philippines has the right legal frameworks in place to promote women’s empowerment and Karen’s advocacy efforts are critical in changing the mindsets that hold back their implementation so that these frameworks continue to advance the rights of women and girls.”
Karen Davila has been an active advocate for UN Women in the Philippines since 2020. She spearheaded the "Agapay Nanay" initiative, delivering crucial support to nearly 5,000 beneficiaries during Typhoon Ulysses. With a hands-on approach, she mobilized aid for typhoon-affected women in Rizal and Navotas on Luzon Island. She has been an important voice at UN Women events, moderating International Women’s Day celebrations and the Philippine Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) Awards. She was also a key figure in the UN Women Asia-Pacific campaign #WhenWomenLead, promoting women’s leadership in business and corporate settings as well as emphasizing the critical role women play in peacebuilding.
"Gender equality is at the heart of sustainable development, and it needs to be at the centre of everything the UN and its partners do in the Philippines,” said Gustavo González, United Nations Resident Coordinator in the Philippines. “I cannot think of anyone better placed than Karen to help us drive women’s empowerment forward decisively!”

As a new National Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women, Ms. Davila joins a select group of celebrated personalities in the fields of entertainment, sports and activism, including award-winning actors Anne Hathaway and Nicole Kidman, world-renowned soccer player Marta Vieira da Silva and model and activist Cindy Sirinya Bishop, amongst others.

Goodwill Ambassadors bolster the United Nations' reach and awareness through enhanced visibility, strategic alignment with national objectives, expansive outreach beyond traditional circles, accessible communication on gender equality, and authentic advocacy based on lived experiences.

Title: Forum on Multilateral Responses to Global Challenges: Building Back Together for Peace and Prosperity
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 October 2023
19 OCTOBER, MANILA, PHILIPPINES – The European Union and the United Nations in the Philippines, in partnership with the University of the Philippines College of Law, convened a forum on multilateralism to emphasize the continued importance of global partnerships and cooperation for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
At the halfway mark to the 2030 deadline to achieve the SDGs, the world is grappling with a multitude of challenges – political instability, conflicts, poverty, inequality, climate crisis, and global health issues – with progress towards many global targets having stalled, or even backtracked. Many crises confronted exceed the response capacity of any single institution or actor and required multilateral solutions and joint and decisive action.
The European Union and the United Nations continue to forge strong partnership and cooperation – through aligned engagement on policy, programmatic priorities and advocacy – for the realization of SDGs. Commitment to inclusive multilateral engagement, with space for contributions from all countries and communities, is key for addressing global and local challenges – including in the Philippines, a founding member of the United Nations with a long and rich multilateral tradition.
Echoing Our Common Agenda, the Secretary-General's vision for the future of global cooperation, Gustavo González, United Nations Resident Coordinator in the Philippines, underscored the need for a new generation of multilateralism that is more responsive to evolving global challenges. “We have to admit that the multilateral system is at greater strain now than at any other time since the creation of the United Nations,” he said, adding that “the effectiveness of our multilateral system will be measured by whether it will lead to a safe, healthy, and inclusive world for the present and future generations.”
This vision is shared by key regional actors such as the European Union, which recognize the need to work with partners to achieve common goals: peace, prosperity and security. Luc Véron, European Union Ambassador to the Philippines, highlighted the important multilateral support for the peace process in Mindanao and emphasized that sustainable peace is critical to achieving sustainable development. “More than ever, we need to have a well-functioning, rules-based international order with an effective United Nations at its core,” he said.
The Forum on Multilateral Responses to Global Challenges: Building Back Together for Peace and Prosperity is part of a series of events held in October for UN Month to highlight and strengthen the collaborations between the Unite Nations and partners in government, civil society, private sector and the international community. With the theme "SDGs: A Race We Can Win," which is part of the global campaign, these events aim to amplify the drumbeat of opportunity to achieve the SDGs.

Title: UN, KOICA call for empowerment of Filipino youth to spur sustainable growth
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
16 August 2023
MANILA, Philippines – In commemoration of International Youth Day, United Nations agencies in the Philippines and the Korea International Cooperation Agency highlight the important role that young people play in society, especially in ushering change.
MANILA, Philippines – In commemoration of International Youth Day, United Nations agencies in the Philippines and the Korea International Cooperation Agency highlight the important role that young people play in society, especially in ushering change.
The United Nations has chosen "Green Skills for Youth: Towards a Sustainable World" as the global theme for International Youth Day 2023. This theme highlights the importance of shifting towards an environmentally sustainable and climate-friendly world, which is not only essential for addressing the global climate crisis, but also crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
"Young people are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and other challenges of our society, but they are also the most innovative, resourceful and determined," said Gustavo Gonzalez, United Nations (UN) Philippines Resident Coordinator. "We need to invest in and involve young people. We must give them the tools they need to be leaders in the fight against climate change and other social issues such as adolescent pregnancy that may hinder them from reaching their full potential. They need to be given the opportunity to actively shape their future!"
Gonzalez said it is important to “put the Filipino youth at the front and center of all our efforts. With all of their talent and potential, they are the key to reaching sustainable growth and development.” This is especially true for the Philippines, which is hoping to reap the benefits of the demographic transition towards having a larger productive population. Based on the latest National Demographic and Health Survey, Filipino children and youth (0-24 years of age) comprise 49.5% of the country’s population.
Southern Leyte and Samar are in the Eastern Visayas region, which is among the areas in the Philippines most affected by climate-related disasters and relatively higher rates of poverty. The UN, with the support of KOICA, wants to focus on empowering young girls towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.
The Republic of Korea, through KOICA, is currently funding a joint programme implemented by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children’s Funds (UNICEF), and the World Health Organization (WHO) that aims to reduce cases of adolescent pregnancy in the Philippines and ensure that girls are able to stay in school and are able to achieve their full potential.
The partners are working closely with  the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Education (DepEd), and the governors of Samar and Southern Leyte, as well as other government agencies in rolling out adolescent-friendly mobile health facilities, building the capacity of community adolescent health service providers, accelerating the integration of comprehensive sexuality education in schools, implementing Youth Leadership and Governance Initiatives, and conducting research on Adolescent Pregnancy and Child, Early, and Forced Marriage.
“With nearly 50% of the population being under the age of 24, the Philippines recognizes that supporting and empowering its youth is the key to achieving national development goals. KOICA is strategically focusing its support in the field of maternal and child health, and notably, in collaboration with 4 UN agencies and the Philippine Government, has been providing $6.4 million in funding for Accelerating the Reduction of Adolescent Pregnancy since 2022. This year’s theme is a great reminder to encourage multi-sectoral convergence to strengthen climate resilience and equip the youth with green skills. Through this 4-year joint project, I am hopeful that it can create a huge impact on achieving a better future for Filipino youth who are able to make better choices on their own sexual and reproductive health,” said KOICA Country Director KIM Eunsub.
“Girls must be among the new generation of leaders building our sustainable future, as they are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,” said UNFPA Philippines Country Representative Dr. Leila Joudane.
“As leaders call for a future of green skills among youth, girls must not be excluded. Through our project with KOICA, we can ensure that more girls are able to access opportunities and have better futures,” she added.
UNFPA explained that it's important to prepare young people with knowledge on sexual and reproductive health and rights, especially in the times of heightened risk of climate change related disasters.
KOICA and the UN agencies said the joint programme is a valuable investment for the future of the young people in Samar and Southern Leyte that will empower them to make decisions for their own health, dignity, and well-being. Its multisectoral approach will also serve as a model for the rest of the country.
“One pregnant teenager is too many. If we help address teenage pregnancies, we contribute to ending the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Let’s invest in improving the health and help-seeking behaviors of young people, especially girls. While our government works on improving the quality and accessibility of services, equipping young people with appropriate life skills to make informed decisions should also be our priority,” said UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov.
Before the pandemic, World Bank data showed that the Philippines has the 2nd highest adolescent fertility rate in the ASEAN region. Latest data suggest there are around 14 million single mothers in the Philippines and they face economic and social challenges as adolescent pregnancy can result in dropping out from school.

Title: The complex path in the investigation of potentially unlawful deaths
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
12 July 2023
Op-ed by UN Resident Coordinator in the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez on the implementation of the “Minnesota Protocol” on the investigation of potentially unlawful death (2016) as a step forward in promoting accountability
The challenge of preventing unlawful killings is global. We just need to look at the most recent news on media to understand its dimensions and social impact. I have in mind the killing in 2017 of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos, at the hands of police. In this case, investigations resulted in the conviction of the responsible police officers. But in most cases, there is no CCTV footage, basic elements of investigations are lacking, and families of victims are left without the truth of what happened to their loved ones, while perpetrators walk free and are not held accountable.
Last week, from 3-7 July, the Government of the Philippines together with the United Nations (UN) under the UN Joint Programme for Human Rights took a significant step to help address this. In partnership with global and Philippine experts, 26 participants, including representatives of government agencies, senior level prosecutors, security forces, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) and civil society came together in a week-long intensive training to discuss how to implement the so-called “Minnesota Protocol” on the investigation of potentially unlawful death (2016) in the country.  Internationally, the Minnesota Protocol is considered to be the gold standard in such investigations. It sets out the relevant legal framework, and elaborates on the conduct of an investigation, including the investigation process, witness interviews and protection, recovery of human remains, identification of dead bodies, types of evidence and sampling, autopsies and the analysis of human remains, as well as several guidelines, annexes and pictorial charts including anatomical sketches.
The firm grounding in the Minnesota Protocol and other international human rights standards was a unique feature of the training. Facilitators and participants applied these to practical exercises, real-life scenarios, and best practices from other countries where the Minnesota Protocol is adapted to the national forensic guidelines.
Last week’s training brought together global experts in this field. Dr. Morris Tidball-Binz, a forensic doctor who currently serves as UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary killings, has conducted fact-finding, technical assessments and capacity-building missions in over 70 counties. In 1987 he was invited by the Presidential Committee on Human Rights of the Philippines, in his capacity as director of the Argentine Team of Forensic Anthropology, to train Philippine investigators on the recovery, identification and documentation of the remains of the disappeared. Stephen Cordner, Professor of Forensic Medicine at Monash University with experience globally, has undertaken autopsies in, and/or death investigations from, most jurisdictions of Australia, New Zealand, Timor Leste, Fiji and other Pacific Island nations, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, India, Jamaica, Canada, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Atty. Kingsley Abbot has worked at the Khmer Rouge Tribunal in Cambodia and as a Trial Counsel in the Office of the Prosecutor at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon in the Hague and has contributed to the development of the Minnesota Protocol as part of the International Commission of Jurists.  Dr. Luis Fondebrider, co-founder and long-term head of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF), has worked in 60 countries advising the ICRC and the UN, and has provided advice to truth commissions and international criminal tribunals. Ms. Leone Scott is a former police officer who has led and contributed to the development of methodologies for victim and survivor interviewing and investigative interviewing, with a particular focus on handling and effective interviewing of vulnerable and at-risk victims and witnesses, including victims of sexual assault and abuse. National experts, including Dr. Raquel Fortun and Dr. Cecilia Lim of the University of the Philippines (UP) Medical College also facilitated sessions.
Global experience shows that the application of the Minnesota Protocol either through enacting legislation or adapting the Protocol into the existing manuals or guidelines at the domestic level has proven to be a useful tool for investigating cases of unlawful killings and enforced disappearances. Its practical approach complements other protocols such as the so-called “Istanbul Protocol” on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
For example, training participants explored what the Minnesota Protocol says about interviewing victims and witnesses and were able to compare this to their everyday work. They also worked in teams to solve resources constraints that may exist when arriving at crime scenes.
The training programme is just one element contributing towards strengthening investigations and addressing impunity. The week-long session also served to go more in-depth on issues related to legal and policy reform, and to explore how to strengthen forensic capacity in the Philippines, which is one of the key priorities of the Department of Justice (DoJ). In this sense, the establishment of a National Forensic Institute, legislation related to mandatory autopsies, adoption of specialized training for Philippine doctors, and further cascading of knowledge about the Minnesota Protocol to be used alongside domestic procedures in all regions of the Philippines are all elements that will definitely strengthen accountability. Cooperation with other countries, including in the Southeast Asia region, will also contribute to exchanges on best practices.
The participation of the academe and civil society organizations (CSOs) in the training together with prosecutors, investigators and medical personnel has been critical. This enhanced a common understanding of the investigation procedures and steps to be taken when investigating potentially unlawful killings, and may also help strengthen coordination among different stakeholders. A trust building investment.
The Minnesota Protocol provides civil society actors with another tool in their advocacy, and a framework for detailed engagement with state actors when helping families of those killed. Through a framework of State obligations, such as the duty to investigate, the Minnesota Protocol outlines the steps of what is required, so that victim family members and CSOs supporting them can ask detailed questions related to what steps have and have not been taken.
As the UN, we are certainly proud of bringing the best knowledge and expertise to address complex development issues, such as justice and accountability. Without them, development risks not being as sustainable as we want.
We remain committed to continuing the work towards the full implementation of the Minnesota Protocol, and appreciate the constructive engagement that has started in this area, which is supported now by nine strong friends of the Philippines[1]--contributors to the UN Joint Programme for Human Rights.

Title: European Union-Philippines Trade Conference highlights the need of going green for small businesses
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
06 December 2022
The discussions at the conference highlighted the importance and impact of ‘going green' for Philippine micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) exporting to the EU
MANILA, 6 December--As part of the EU-DTI Arise Plus Philippines project, the first European Union (EU)-Philippines Conference on green transition and trade was held in Manila during the ongoing National Exporters’ Week.

Under the theme, ‘The Green Transition: Opportunities and Challenges for Philippine MSMEs’, the discussions at the conference highlighted the importance and impact of ‘going green' for Philippine micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) exporting to the EU.

International and national experts and practitioners raised awareness on the new agenda for sustainable growth of the EU, also called the ‘Green Deal’ during various sessions.

The event provided an introduction to the circular economy, deforestation-free products and carbon adjustment.  Discussions focussed on the opportunities and challenges this Green agenda entails for Philippine exporters and MSMEs.

“Having this “Green Deal” session is an opportunity for the Philippine MSMEs to be informed of the importance of sustainable production in enabling them to access more diverse and high-value markets, especially the EU,” DTI-Trade Promotions Group (TPG) Assistant Secretary Glenn G. Peñaranda said.

Philipp Dupuis, Minister Counsellor, Head of the Economic and Trade Section, Delegation of the EU to the Philippines speaking on the occasion, said : “Conferences like the one today are essential to inform exporters in our partner countries about what the Green Deal is and how it can affect the requirements of their EU business partners have towards them”.

Rajesh Aggarwal, Director Division of Market Development, International Trade Centre, ARISE’s main implementer, said: “This conference will pave the way for enabling Philippine SMEs to become export competitive and make their mark in international trade. We are grateful to be part of this initiative from the EU and DTI”

As part of the efforts to mainstream and support women entrepreneurs, the event also officialised the institutionalization of the ITC-DTI SheTrades Hub in the Philippines.

“With the institutionalization of the SheTrades Philippines Hub, the DTI-Export Marketing Bureau will work with ITC to further strengthen our country’s efforts in promoting women’s economic empowerment and lower or eliminate the barriers faced by women entrepreneurs, at home and internationally, to foster a more inclusive and sustainable economic growth,” DTI- TPG Assistant Secretary Peñaranda added.

About Arise Plus Philippines

With an allocation of 5.8 million euro, the European Union-funded ARISE Plus Philippines helps Philippine exporters take advantage of EU market access and of the trade privileges granted under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP+). ARISE promotes awareness of new trade opportunities in the private sector in the Philippines, but also helps local MSMEs upgrade their production processes to meet international quality standards. In this way, the project supports the overall EU-Philippines trade relationship and trade-related policies by improving trade performance of the Philippines and fostering inclusive economic growth.

ARISE Plus Philippines is a project of the EU and the Government of the Philippines, with the Department of Trade and Industry as the lead partner. Other government agencies involved are the Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration, Bureau of Customs and the Department of Science and Technology. The International Trade Centre (ITC) is the technical agency supporting the project’s implementation.

About National Exporters’ Week (NEW)

The National Exporters’ Week is an annual event led by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) through the Export Marketing Bureau (EMB), in partnership with the Export Development Council (EDC) and the Philippine Exporters Confederation, Inc. (PHILEXPORT). Presidential Proclamation 931, series of 1996 and House Resolution No.33 declared the first week of December as the Exporters’ Week in order to obtain total commitment of the government and the private sector to continuously work together to sustain export promotion and development.

Title: UN and humanitarian partners support 1M Odette-affected persons in last six months; recovery work continues till end of 2022
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 July 2022
The UN Philippines marks Six Months Since Typhoon Odette with report on humanitarian partners' response efforts and their focus now on supporting local governments to implement early recovery activities
MANILA, 20 July 2022--Six months after Typhoon Odette (international name: Rai) left a trail of devastation in 11 of the country’s 17 regions, the United Nations (UN) and humanitarian partners in the Philippines, and in support of the Government-led response, have provided life-saving assistance to over a million people. Since April, following the announcement by the Government  of the  end of the response phase, the humanitarian community has since been supporting local governments to implement early recovery activities.
To mark six months since Typhoon Odette, the UN Philippines launched today the Typhoon Odette Six Months On Photo Exhibition at the Instituto Cervantes in Intramuros. This exhibition, hosted by the Embassy of Spain, the Instituto Cervantes and AECID and coordinated by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on behalf of the Humanitarian Community, seeks to raise awareness of the increase in the occurrence of disasters as a direct impact of climate change and its effects on the development of societies. It will be open to the public until 20 August, to mark World Humanitarian Day on 19 August.
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez said, “The Humanitarian Community will continue its support to the affected communities to ensure that progress made in the last six months is not rolled back.”
Gonzalez cited a recent report of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which stated that damaged houses still number over 2.1 million. The revised Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) plan which was launched by the Humanitarian Country Team in the Philippines on 2 February committed to provide assistance to 840,000 people in Caraga, Southern Leyte, Cebu and Bohol.  Shelter assistance, as one of the main needs, was provided to over 210,000 typhoon-affected households. To date, close to 66,000 families have received kitchen items, sleeping kits, and lighting items. More Shelter Repair Kits and other shelter materials for the rebuilding of homes are needed however.
At the same time, over 3,000 people remain displaced in five regions (Regions VI, VII, VIII, MIMAROPA, and Caraga). In order to relocate these internally displaced persons (IDPs), resettlement sites need to be prepared.
Gonzalez also noted that in the last six months over 1.2 million people have received livelihood support, particularly for agriculture. Humanitarian partners have started implementing cash-for-work activities in Bohol and Southern Leyte, and this has helped beneficiaries to restart fishing and farming livelihoods. However, restarting agricultural activities is hampered by a number of factors, including the unfinished clearing of debris left by Typhoon Odette, and challenges in operating farming equipment due to oil price increases.
Gonzalez said that some 84,000 healthcare workers have been deployed and have served in temporary health facilities. However, health facilities remain semi-functional in many areas, and communities continue to require support to access health services.
Close to 46,000 children aged 0-59 months have been screened for acute malnutrition. The quality and coverage of services for the early detection and treatment of life-threatening acute malnutrition in early childhood needs to be improved and prioritized.
Earlier, in the response effort, humanitarian partners deployed 562 trucks to deliver relief items. While logistics operations for Typhoon Odette have ended, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) had requested humanitarian organizations to move cargo in response to Tropical Storm Agaton. The goods were moved into areas also affected by Typhoon Odette, including the delivery of Government supplied food, hygiene items, and family/sleeping kits, among others.
Gonzalez acknowledged the support of donors such as USAID,  the European Union, Japan, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), Australia, Canada and Spain for enabling the UN and over 260 humanitarian partners to address urgent humanitarian needs and implement early recovery programmes through more than 15,000 activities in food security and nutrition, protection, shelter, WASH, education, health and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM).
At the same time, Gonzalez said that while long-term and sustained recovery will be the focus of support to the Government until the end of the year, the Humanitarian Community will reinforce   measures to strengthen preparedness and build resilience against future shocks.
“Humanitarian partners will continue to work closely with local authorities to pilot new approaches such as anticipatory action,” Gonzalez said.
“As nations continue to address the different impacts of the global pandemic, the reality is several hazards may strike at once.  The Philippines has already experienced responding to catastrophes in a COVID-19 crisis scenario and amid difficult access to resources due to the war in Ukraine. This is forcing all of us to change the way operations are being conducted,” he added.

Title: PHL, UN and partners endorse roadmap to accelerate implementation of human rights joint programme
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 December 2021
The Philippines-United Nations (UN) Joint Programme on human rights took its first major step with agreement on a roadmap to implement Human Rights Council (HRC) resolution 45/33, adopted on 7 October 2020, which outlined specific areas for capacity-building and technical cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Philippines
MANILA, 20 December 2021—The Philippines-United Nations (UN) Joint Programme on human rights took its first major step today at the Steering Committee meeting of government and civil society partners and participating UN agencies, where they agreed on a roadmap to implement Human Rights Council (HRC) resolution 45/33, adopted on 7 October 2020, which outlined specific areas for capacity-building and technical cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Philippines.
The steering committee meeting today was participated in by Department of Justice Secretary Menardo I. Guevarra, UN Resident Coordinator Gustavo Gonzalez, and representatives of government, UN and civil society partners. 

Guevarra said, "The Joint Programme seeks to affirm the commitment of the Philippines to the primacy of human rights, the importance of a free democratic space for civil society, and the principle of international cooperation—key values that the Philippines holds dear as a founding charter member of the UN."
UN Resident Coordinator in the Philippines Gustavo Gonzalez said, “Today’s meeting is an important step forward in the implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 45/33.  Concrete actions, milestones and tools have been discussed and adopted. Everyone has a role in the joint programme and is accountable for the expected results.”

The human rights joint programme received a boost recently with combined financial support from the governments of Norway and Australia of some Php29 million.

“I thank the Governments of Australia and Norway for their readiness in supporting the Joint Programme. They know that respect for human rights is a core component of sustainable and inclusive development,” Gonzalez said.

"Australia is committed to see this programme succeed and deliver tangible results. We congratulate the Government of the Pilippines for its efforts," said Ambassador Steven Robinson of the Embassy of Australia.

On 22 July 2021, the Philippines and the UN signed the UN Joint Programme Programme on Human Rights. The three-year UN joint programme was developed to implement Human Rights Council (HRC) resolution 45/33, adopted on 7 October 2020, which outlined specific areas for capacity-building and technical cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Philippines. The joint programme document was signed by Secretary Guevarra, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro L. Locsin Jr.,and Gonzalez, with the late Jose Luis Gascon of the Commission on Human Rights in attendance.

Aside from the DoJ, the UN joint programme is being co-implemented by the Presidential Human Rights Committee Secretariat (PHRCS), the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), the Department of Health (DOH), the Anti-Terrorism Council-Program Management Center (ATC-PMC), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) and the Commission on Human Rights (CHR). Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) as well as the academe will also be core partners in the implementation of the programme.  

UN entities involved in the programme - the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the UN Office of Counter Terrorism (UNOCT); and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) – will work with the Government, drawing on expertise and best practices to apply human rights-based approaches in these areas.
Gonzalez said, "The UN Joint Programme on Human Rights brings together different actors to find solutions to complex challenges. This is not always an easy task, but these challenges cannot be resolved by trainings and expertise alone. Resolving them requires leadership and courage."
"This Joint Programme forges a lasting partnership for the advancement of the principles declared in the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights and Article III of the 1987 Constitution--the Philippines’ own Bill of Rights," said Guevarra.

Through the joint programme, the UN in the Philippines will engage in capacity-building and technical cooperation in six areas, namely, strengthening domestic investigation and accountability mechanisms; data gathering on alleged police violations; civic space and engagement with civil society and the Commission on Human Rights (CHR); national mechanism for reporting and follow-up; counter-terrorism legislation; and human rights-based approaches to drug control.

Title: UN Secretary-General's Message for the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, 26 June
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
28 June 2021
Science and trust in science are the hero and lesson of the pandemic; the world needs both to win against the virus. Scientists delivered safe and effective vaccines in record time. Access to reliable and verifiable information is making the difference between life and death.
Action based on evidence is crucial for our responses to drugs, too.
The world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate pandemic impacts and hinder a healthy and inclusive recovery. The forthcoming World Drug Report 2021 from the United Office on Drugs and Crime shows that deaths attributed to disorders related to drug use have nearly doubled over the past decade.  New HIV infections among adults worldwide have declined in recent years, but not among people who inject drugs, who accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.
International cooperation has helped to limit the proliferation of new psychoactive substances, but the problem is shifting to poorer regions where control systems are weaker. Dark web drug sales continue to rise, and non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, including opioids, is expanding.
Drug trafficking and organized crime fuel and perpetuate cycles of violence and conflict. Armed groups and terrorists profit from the illicit drug trade, and the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people even more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit crop cultivation.
Disparities in access to essential controlled medicines in low- and middle-income countries have been further heightened in the pandemic. For example, medical professionals in West and Central Africa in 2019 had four doses of pain medication every day for one million inhabitants; in North America, the number of doses was nearly 32,000.
Investing in balanced prevention as well as control of drug use and drug use disorders produces solid returns -- saved lives, healthier populations, improved workforce participation and productivity, and reduced criminal justice costs.
Many of the risk factors associated with crime and violent behaviour are also drivers of drug use, and targeted efforts focusing on these overlapping dynamics -- including childhood maltreatment and lack of social support -- can help to strengthen prevention.
Moreover, research suggests that law enforcement and policing need to go after the criminals at the upper levels of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profits and wreak the greatest violence.
Public-private partnerships - with tech companies, postal and courier services, and shipping companies - represent an essential frontline response in the new fight against drug traffickers, who are increasingly exploiting the legal cargo trade and postal services to move their illicit product.
Better data is also helping to identify trends and enable real-time monitoring of rapidly shifting trafficking routes. Science-driven early warning systems are helping to predict emerging drug threats. Greater international cooperation and support are needed to help low-income countries to take advantage of these advanced capabilities.
The theme of this year’s observance of the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, “Share facts on drugs. Save lives” is a call for solidarity. I urge all Member States to listen to the science and take action, building on agreed international frameworks and drawing on United Nations support for health and justice.

Title: UN Secretary-General's Message for World Refugee Day, 20 June 2021
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
18 June 2021
War, violence and persecution have forced more than 80 million people around the world to flee their homes, leaving everything behind to save themselves and their families.
Refugees must begin their lives anew.
But for so many, the pandemic has wiped out their livelihoods, led to stigmatization and vilification and exposed them disproportionately to the virus.
At the same time, refugees once again demonstrated their invaluable contribution to their adoptive societies as essential and frontline workers.
We have a duty to help refugees rebuild their lives.
COVID-19 has shown us that we can only succeed if we stand together.
On World Refugee Day, I call on communities and governments to include refugees – in health care, education, and sport.
We heal together when we all get the care we need.
We learn together when we are all given the chance to study.
We shine together when we play as a team and respect everyone.
On World Refugee Day, I commend the countries that have welcomed refugees. But we need more support – from States, the private sector, communities and individuals – if we are to move together towards a more inclusive future, free of discrimination.
The refugees I have met have shown me what it means to rebuild your own life while summoning the strength to enrich the lives of others.
As High Commissioner for Refugees for 10 years, I was inspired by their courage, resilience and determination.
I thank refugees and displaced persons across the world and reiterate my personal admiration for what they have taught us all about the power of hope and healing.
This World Refugee Day and every day, we stand together with refugees.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
17 June 2021
Humanity is waging a relentless, self-destructive war on nature.
Biodiversity is declining, greenhouse gas concentrations are rising, and our pollution can be found from the remotest islands to the highest peaks.
We must make peace with nature.
The land can be our greatest ally.  But the land is suffering.
Land degradation from climate change and the expansion of agriculture, cities and infrastructure undermines the well-being of 3.2 billion people.
It harms biodiversity and enables the emergence of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.
Restoring degraded land would remove carbon from the atmosphere.
It would help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change.
And it could generate an extra $1.4 trillion dollars in agricultural production each year.
The best part is that land restoration is simple, inexpensive and accessible to all.
It is one of the most democratic and pro-poor ways of accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
This year marks the start of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.
On this International Day, let us make healthy land central to all our planning.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a tragic reminder of how deeply connected we are.
There is a clear and urgent need for concrete multilateral solutions, based on common action across borders for the good of all humanity, starting with the equitable distribution of vaccines as a global public good.
This need goes far beyond the pandemic. It applies to all the transnational threats we face: the climate crisis; air and water pollution; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; the development of new technologies in the absence of agreed principles and norms.
We need a more networked multilateralism, with stronger coordination between regional and international organizations, international financial institutions and public/private alliances.
We need an inclusive multilateralism, that draws on civil society, business, local and regional authorities and others, and shares power more broadly and fairly.
And we need strong multilateral action now, to emerge from the pandemic safely, to address the climate crisis, and to build stronger, safer communities and societies.
Today, as we mark the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, let’s renew our commitment to global multilateral solutions that deliver for people and planet.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 April 2021
Information and communication technologies have been invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. They help us to stay connected, and to keep vital services and businesses going.
Yet almost half the world is still offline – and most of those who lack access to digital technology are women and girls in developing countries. Latest figures from the International Telecommunication Union show a 17 per cent gender gap in internet use globally. This is even wider in least developed countries. In some regions, this gender gap is growing, reinforcing gender inequalities by denying women and girls opportunities to access education, find better-paid jobs, and start new businesses.
Making these technologies available to all is an essential part of building back stronger communities and economies, and addressing many of the world’s most pressing challenges.
International Girls in ICT Day aims to inspire a global movement to increase the representation of girls and women in technology. Today, let’s recommit to the goal of equal access for young women and girls to opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
06 April 2021
Sport is one of the great human pursuits – a model of teamwork, a platform for individual excellence, a driver of economic growth for all of society.  The United Nations has long worked in wide-ranging ways with athletes and sporting federations and associations to use this great power to build bridges of friendship and coexistence, to promote healthy lifestyles, and to advance our work to achieve sustainable, inclusive development and the 2030 Agenda.
Those involved in sport also have responsibilities: to reduce its environmental footprint; to meet international labour standards; to fight discrimination and prejudice of all kinds; to reject corruption; and to ensure that major global events such as the FIFA World Cup and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which bring the world together, leave a positive legacy.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new challenges to the world of sports.  Workers, fans and athletes have felt the pain of absence, of lost revenue and of dreams deferred.  But many competitions and leagues have found new ways to create opportunities for community and joy despite the crisis.
As vaccines spread hope and spectators begin to return to arenas, the world of sport has crucial contributions to make in forging a safe and sustainable recovery.  The United Nations looks forward to continuing to work with sportspeople and organizations around the world to advance climate action and to promote peace, human rights and sustainable development.  We will play and cheer again when everyone is safe from the pandemic.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
04 April 2021
Today, on the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action, we reflect on how far we have come in raising awareness of the dangers posed by landmines, and recommit to our target of a mine-free world.
More than 160 states are party to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. I call on those that have not yet acceded to the Convention to do so without delay.
Landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised explosive devices disproportionally affect the vulnerable, the forcibly displaced, the dispossessed, and children. They impede peaceful solutions, hinder humanitarian responses and are an obstacle to sustainable, inclusive development.
Unfortunately, we sometimes make progress on clearing mines only to see it rolled back. But we cannot be content simply with advocacy and campaigning to create awareness of the dangers posed by landmines.
The United Nations Charter calls us to complete the work: to survey, clear and destroy these deadly devices.
Let’s make this the last decade when we need to devote ourselves to this task.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
22 March 2021
This year’s World Water Day, with the theme “Valuing water”, asks: What does water mean to me?
The value of water is profound and complex.  There is no aspect of sustainable development that does not fundamentally rely upon it.
For me, water means protection.  A well-managed water cycle – encompassing drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, wastewater, transboundary governance, the environment and more – means a defence against ill-health and indignity and a response to challenges from a changing climate and increasing global demand.
This World Water Day, we want to record and understand as many views as possible, so decision-makers are better informed and equipped to safeguard this human right for every person and every purpose.
Today, we are not on track to ensure everyone has access to water and sanitation by 2030, as set out in Sustainable Development Goal 6.  While advances being made, current progress needs to quadruple to achieve universal access.
Chronic under-investment in water and sanitation disadvantages and harms vast numbers of people.  This is unacceptable.
I am encouraged by the joint statement signed by some 160 countries during the UN High-Level meeting on water on 18 March.  This shows a strong commitment to advancing all water-related aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals.
On this World Water Day, let us commit to intensifying efforts to truly valuing water so all may have equitable access to this most precious resource.

Watch the video message
The COVID-19 pandemic has erased decades of progress towards gender equality.
From high job losses to exploding burdens of unpaid care, from disrupted schooling to an escalating crisis of domestic violence and exploitation, women’s lives have been upended and their rights eroded.
Mothers – especially single mothers – have faced acute anxiety and adversity.
The consequences will far outlast the pandemic.
But women have also been on the frontlines of pandemic response.
They are the essential workers keeping people alive and holding economies, communities and families together.
They are among the leaders who have kept prevalence rates lower, and countries on track for recovery.
This year’s International Women’s Day highlights the transformative power of women’s equal participation.
We are seeing it ourselves at the United Nations, where I am proud that we have achieved gender parity in UN leadership posts for the first time in history.
The evidence is clear.
When women lead in government, we see bigger investments in social protection and greater inroads against poverty.
When women are in parliament, countries adopt more stringent climate change policies.
When women are at the peace table, agreements are more enduring.
And with women now serving in equal numbers at the top leadership posts at the United Nations, we are seeing even more concerted action to secure peace, sustainable development and human rights.
In a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture, gender equality is essentially a question of power.
Males are an essential part of the solution.
I call on countries, companies and institutions to adopt special measures and quotas to advance women’s equal participation and achieve rapid change.
As we recover from the pandemic, support and stimulus packages must target women and girls specifically, including through investments in women-owned businesses and the care economy.
Pandemic recovery is our chance to leave behind generations of exclusion and inequalities.
Whether running a country, a business or a popular movement, women are making contributions that are delivering for all and driving progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
It is time to build an equal future.  This is a job for everyone – and for the benefit of everyone.
Thank you.

[Watch the video message]
Advancing gender equality in science and technology is essential for building a better future.
We have seen this yet again in the fight against COVID-19.
Women, who represent 70 per cent of all healthcare workers, have been among those most affected by the pandemic and among those leading the response to it.
Gender inequalities have increased dramatically in the past year, as women bear the brunt of school closures and working from home.
Many women scientists are facing closed labs and increased care responsibilities, leaving less time for critical research.
For women in scientific fields, these challenges have exacerbated an already difficult situation.
According to UNESCO, women account for only one third of the world’s researchers, and occupy fewer senior positions than men at top universities.
This disparity has led to a lower publication rate, less visibility, less recognition and, critically, less funding.
Meanwhile, artificial Intelligence and machine learning replicate existing biases.
Women and girls belong in science.
Yet stereotypes have steered women and girls away from science-related fields.
It is time to recognize that greater diversity fosters greater innovation.
Without more women in STEM, the world will continue to be designed by and for men, and the potential of girls and women will remain untapped.
We must ensure that girls have access to the education they deserve and that they can see a future for themselves in engineering, computer programming, cloud technology, robotics and health sciences.
This is critical for our work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
Increasing women’s participation in STEM can close the gender pay gap and boost women’s  earnings by $299 billion over the next ten years.
STEM skills are also crucial in closing the global Internet user gap.
Together, let’s end gender discrimination, and ensure that all women and girls fulfill their potential and are an integral part in building a better world for all.

[Watch the Secretary-General's video message here]
When education is interrupted, it affects everyone – especially students, teachers and families.
Today, on the third International Day of Education, I pay tribute to their resilience in the face of a pandemic that, at its peak, forced almost every school, institute and university to close its doors.
Although this disruption has led to learning innovations, it has also dashed hopes of a brighter future among vulnerable populations.
All of us pay the price.
After all, education is the foundation for expanding opportunities, transforming economies, fighting intolerance, protecting our planet and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
As the world continues to battle the pandemic, education – as a fundamental right and a global public good – must be protected to avert a generational catastrophe.
Even before the pandemic, some 258 million children and adolescents were out of school, the majority of them girls.
More than half of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries were not learning to read a simple text.
In 2021, we must seize all opportunities to turn this situation around.
We must ensure the full replenishment of the Global Partnership for Education fund, and strengthen global education cooperation.
We must also step up our efforts to reimagine education – training teachers, bridging the digital divide and rethinking curricula to equip learners with the skills and knowledge to flourish in our rapidly changing world.
Let us commit to promote education for all — today and every day.

On this International Migrants Day, we reflect on a year in which, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions upon millions of people have experienced the pain of separation from friends and family, the uncertainty of employment and the need to adapt to a new and unfamiliar reality.
These are emotions felt by migrants around the world every day.
Across this challenging year, we have also come to appreciate our dependence on those who are too often invisible within our communities. Migrants have played an outsized role on the frontlines of responding to the crisis – from caring for the sick and elderly to ensuring food supplies during lockdowns – highlighting their broader contributions to societies around the world.
Just as migrants are integral to our societies, they should remain central to our recovery.
We must ensure that migrants, irrespective of their legal status, are included in every country’s pandemic response, particularly in health and vaccination programming. We must reject hate speech and acts of xenophobia. And we must find solutions for those migrants who have been left stranded, without income or legal status, and without means to return home.
On this International Migrants Day, let us seize the opportunity of the recovery from the pandemic to implement the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, reimagine human mobility, enable migrants to reignite economies at home and abroad and build more inclusive and resilient societies.

Title: Carbon neutrality by 2050: The world's most urgent mission
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
13 December 2020
As the world marks the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, a promising movement for carbon neutrality is taking shape.  By next month, countries representing more than 65 per cent of harmful greenhouse gasses and more than 70 per cent of the world economy will have committed to achieve net zero emissions by the middle of the century.
At the same time, the main climate indicators are worsening.  While the Covid-19 pandemic has temporarily reduced emissions, carbon dioxide levels are still at record highs – and rising.  The past decade was the hottest on record; Arctic sea ice in October was the lowest ever, and apocalyptic fires, floods, droughts and storms are increasingly the new normal.  Biodiversity is collapsing, deserts are spreading, oceans are warming and choking with plastic waste.  Science tells us that unless we cut fossil fuel production by 6 per cent every year between now and 2030, things will get worse.  Instead, the word is on track for a 2 per cent annual rise.
Pandemic recovery gives us an unexpected yet vital opportunity to attack climate change, fix our global environment, re-engineer economies and re-imagine our future.  Here is what we must do:
First, we need build a truly global coalition for carbon neutrality by 2050.
The European Union has committed to do so. The United Kingdom, Japan, the Republic of Korea and more than 110 countries have done the same.  So, too, has the incoming United States administration.  China has pledged to get there before 2060.
Every country, city, financial institution and company should adopt plans for net zero -- and act now to get on the right path to that goal, which means cutting global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels.  In advance of next November’s UN Climate Conference in Glasgow, Governments are obligated by the Paris Agreement to be ever more ambitious every five years and submit strengthened commitments known as Nationally Determined Contributions, and these NDCs must show true ambition for carbon neutrality.
Technology is on our side.  It costs more to simply run most of today’s coal plants than it does to build new renewable plants from scratch.  Economic analysis confirms the wisdom of this path.  According to the International Labour Organization, despite inevitable job losses, the clean energy transition will create 18 million net new jobs by 2030.  But we must recognize the human costs of decarbonization, and support workers with social protection, re-skilling and up-skilling so that the transition is just.
Second, we need to align global finance with the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, the world’s blueprint for a better future.
It is time to put a price on carbon; end fossil fuel subsidies and finance; stop building new coal power plants; shift the tax burden from income to carbon, from taxpayers to polluters; make climate-related financial risk disclosures mandatory; and integrate the goal of carbon neutrality into all economic and fiscal decision-making.  Banks must align their lending with the net zero objective, and asset owners and managers must decarbonize their portfolios.
Third, we must secure a breakthrough on adaptation and resilience to help those already facing dire impacts of climate change.
That’s not happening enough today: adaptation represents only 20 per cent of climate finance.  This hinders our efforts to reduce disaster risk.  It also isn’t smart; every $1 invested in adaptation measures could yield almost $4 in benefits.  Adaptation and resilience are especially urgent for small island developing states, for which climate change is an existential threat.
Next year gives us a wealth of opportunities to address our planetary emergencies, through major United Nations conferences and other efforts on biodiversity, oceans, transport, energy, cities and food systems.  One of our best allies is nature itself: nature-based solutions could provide one-third of the net reductions in greenhouse gas emissions required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.  Indigenous knowledge can help to point the way.  And as humankind devises strategies for preserving the environment and building a green economy, we need more women decision-makers at the table.
COVID and climate have brought us to a threshold.  We cannot go back to the old normal of inequality and fragility; instead we must step towards a safer, more sustainable path.  This is a complex policy test and an urgent moral test.  With decisions today setting our course for decades to come, we must make pandemic recovery and climate action two sides of the same coin.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
08 December 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us just how important it is for all countries to have strong health systems that provide the entire population with quality services when and where they need them.
This year we have seen the tragedy that strikes when health facilities are overwhelmed by a new, highly infectious and often deadly disease – and when the effort to address that emergency means that systems are so stretched they can no longer provide other essential services such as cancer screening, routine immunization and care for mothers and babies.
We must do far more if we are to reach our goal of achieving universal health coverage by 2030.
This means spending more on health. But it also means spending better, from protecting health workers and strengthening infrastructure to preventing diseases and providing healthcare close to home, in the community.  Investments in health systems also improve countries’ preparedness and response to future health emergencies.
Health emergencies have disproportionate impacts on marginalized and vulnerable populations.  As new COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments become available, they must reach all those who need them.  This year’s pandemic has shown us that no one is safe until everyone is safe.
In responding to the pandemic, we have seen rapid innovative approaches to health service delivery and models of care, and advances in preparedness. We must learn from this experience.
For Universal Health Coverage Day, let us commit to end this crisis and build a safer and healthier future by investing in health systems that protect us all — now.

Every year on 5 December, the world observes International Volunteer Day.
This year, we are highlighting the important contributions of volunteers to the response
to COVID-19.
Around the world, volunteers have been assisting vulnerable groups, correcting misinformation, educating children, providing essential services to the elderly, and supporting front-line health workers.
As we gradually recover from the pandemic, volunteers will have a key role to play in accelerating the transition to green, inclusive and just economies.
Indeed, volunteering is the backbone of our societies.
Often working with the United Nations, volunteers build a sense of togetherness.
They strengthen social cohesion.
And they help to protect communities, especially by reaching those most at need.
That is why, on International Volunteer Day, I appeal to all governments to promote volunteering, support volunteer efforts and recognize volunteer contributions to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Volunteers deserve our heartfelt thanks.

Title: UN extends call for help to Typhoon Vamco-affected areas in Northern Luzon
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
27 November 2020
MANILA, 27 November 2020 -- Three weeks after launching its response to help address the immediate and early recovery needs of communities worst hit by Super Typhoon Goni (Rolly), the United Nations and its humanitarian partners today released a revised Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) plan, further extending support to areas severely affected by Typhoon Vamco (Ulysses) in Northern Luzon.

In its support to the government-led response to Typhoons Goni and Vamco, country-based humanitarian partners under the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) umbrella will focus on lifesaving and time-critical recovery needs of people, especially women and girls, living in the hardest-hit provinces of Albay and Catanduanes in Bicol Region and the most affected areas of the province of Cagayan in Cagayan Valley Region.

The revised HNP brings together collective humanitarian activities from November 2020 to April 2021 with a new total funding request of US$52.6 million (PhP 2.5 billion). The call for resources will directly assist 278,100 affected people in terms of food, access to clean watersanitation-hygiene (WASH) facilities, emergency shelter and livelihood, health and early recovery. Following a review of overall needs, 18,100 most vulnerable people who were severely affected by Typhoon Vamco in Cagayan were added to the original target of 260,000 people in Albay and Catanduanes.

On 23 November, the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) Gustavo Gonzalez joined the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF) and Ambassadors from Germany and Netherlands visited Tuguegarao to directly coordinate with the provincial government of Cagayan in identifying the needs and gaps as well as prioritize humanitarian interventions in the flood-affected areas. This followed visit earlier in November to see at first hand the impact of Typhoon Goni on communities in Albay. “I had the opportunity to visit Tuguegarao and consult with local government officials and people directly affected by the floods. This and my earlier visit to Albay highlighted to me the extraordinary efforts made by the government at all levels to protect vulnerable communities. I was also impressed by the spirit of Filipinos as they worked within their battered communities to recover and rebuild their lives”, said Mr. Gonzalez.

As various agencies continue to support response efforts for the two typhoons and to accelerate the stabilization of conditions faced by affected population, UN Under-Secretary General and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, has approved an allocation of $3.1 million (PhP 150 million) for the Philippines from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).
The CERF funding was awarded to UNICEF, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) prioritizing water supplies, sanitation services, hygiene, emergency shelter and food to address time-critical needs. All three agencies are mandated under the CERF to focus on life-saving assistance of the most vulnerable, particularly the poorest single-headed households, elderly and people with disabilities in the hardest hit areas of Albay and Catanduanes. Related needs such as mental health, nutrition and psychosocial support, COVID-19 infection prevention and control, camp management for larger and congested evacuation centres and logistics will be addressed through a collaborative and multi-sectoral approach. The agencies will work with local implementing partners.

Other recent contributions include donor agencies, such as ECHO and USAID, that have raised additional funding support for humanitarian response and recovery efforts, $1.3 million (PhP 60 million) and $3.5 million (PhP 169 million) respectively, which will enable local humanitarian partners in providing relief to displaced communities and people-at-risk in the most affected areas.

A total of US $11.6 million (PhP 562 million) has been successfully mobilized through the HNP to date.

Humanitarian partners in the country – the United Nations, non-governmental organizations, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the private sector - are supporting national and local authorities with the response to the typhoons, building on established partnership agreements and relationships strengthened over years of collaboration. “With continuing influence of La Niña, this may not be the last major storm we have seen this season. The UN and humanitarian partners in the Philippines are not waiting and we are already adapting our approach to meet such challenges, including by building on partnerships for resilience.”, UN RC/HC Gonzalez added.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 November 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of the importance of sanitation, safe water and handwashing facilities to stop the spread of infectious diseases. Everyone should have access to hygienic, safe, sustainable sanitation. That is the only way to ensure health for all.
But around the world today, 4.2 billion people are without safe sanitation. Two billion of these people – more than one quarter of the global population – lack basic sanitation, undermining health, dignity, and economic development.
However, rapid progress on sanitation is possible. Many countries have transformed their sanitation facilities and services within a generation, through programmes including the universal provision of toilets, and improved treatment and use of wastewater. This has had knock-on benefits for their health systems and economies, and for the environment.
Achieving water and sanitation for all would cost an estimated 1.5 percent of global Gross Domestic Product, and would bring considerable economic benefits with an estimated return of more than four dollars for every dollar invested.
Today’s sanitation services must be resilient, in order to deal with shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. Unless we act now, the climate crisis will disrupt sanitation services for millions. We need innovative thinking around sanitation services so they are fit for the future.
On World Toilet Day, let’s resolve to take action to deliver health and sanitation for billions of people around the world, today and for future generations.

Title: UN Secretary-General's Message for the Launch of World Food Week
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
13 October 2020
[Watch the video message here]
The systems that bring food to our tables have a profound impact on our economies, our health and the environment.
Food systems are one of the main reasons we are failing to stay within our planet’s ecological boundaries.
But they can also be the key to tackling the climate crisis, addressing soaring biodiversity loss and healthier societies.
This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragility of our food systems.
Millions more people are hungry, and millions of jobs have been lost.
Meanwhile, the climate emergency continues apace.
To address these issues, I am convening a Food Systems Summit next year.
This will be a ‘People’s Summit’ and a ‘Solutions Summit’.
This action-oriented conversation will come together in two key moments.
The first will be a pre-Summit meeting in Rome in summer next year.
This meeting will build on inclusive country and regional dialogues and will define bold actions for inclusive and sustainable food systems.
The second, will be the Food Systems Summit itself, and will bring the attention of all world leaders to this issue.
We need global engagement and action for inclusive and sustainable food systems.
I urge you to join the conversation.

Title: UN Refugee Agency lauds House of Representatives’ approval of bill recognizing foundlings as Filipinos
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
13 October 2020
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, welcomes the House of Representatives’ approval on third reading of the Foundling Welfare Act, a crucial piece of legislation that would allow foundlings—a population recognized by the Philippines as at risk of statelessness—to be recognized as Filipino citizens and allow access to government programs and services.
Foundlings are at risk of statelessness due to difficulties in establishing their parentage, on which Philippine citizenship is based. Under present laws, foundlings are issued certificates that do not explicitly indicate their citizenship, thus hindering their access to certain rights and services.
House Bill 7679 or the Foundling Welfare Act states that foundlings are natural-born Filipino citizens regardless of the status or circumstances of their birth. The proposed law gives foundlings the right to a birth certificate through registration with the Local Civil Registrar.
Under this measure, foundlings will be entitled to “every available government program or service,” including “registration, facilitation of documents for adoption, education, legal and policy protection, proper nourishment and medical care for survival and development.”
The bill also provides for regular and synchronized data collection to guide policymaking and programming for foundlings.
The Foundling Welfare Act, once enacted into law, would retroactively confirm all foundlings’ citizenship and address their risk of statelessness. Its wide coverage actualizes the 2016 Supreme Court decisions favoring every foundling with a presumption of Filipino citizenship.
The House’s recent approval of the bill is a significant step forward in the Philippines’ National Action Plan to End Statelessness by 2024. It is also a testament to the country’s commitment to addressing statelessness, as indicated in the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and its pledges during the High-Level Segment.
Following the final approval of the bill at the House of Representatives, its counterpart bill, Senate Bill 56 (Foundling Recognition Act) will undergo deliberation at the Senate Committees where it has been referred to. If the Senate version is approved, it will be harmonized with House Bill 7679. The reconciled version will then be submitted to the President for his signature and eventual enactment into law.
UNHCR, in line with its mandate, will continue to provide technical support to the Philippine Congress to facilitate the swift passage of this bill.

Title: UN report: Dramatic rise in climate disasters over last 20 years
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
13 October 2020
GENEVA, 12 October 2020 – A UN report published to mark the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction on October 13, confirms how extreme weather events have come to dominate the disaster landscape in the 21st century.
In the period 2000 to 2019, there were 7,348 major recorded disaster events claiming 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion) resulting in approximately US$2.97 trillion in global economic losses.
This is a sharp increase over the previous twenty years. Between 1980 and 1999, 4, 212 disasters were linked to natural hazards worldwide claiming approximately 1.19 million lives and affecting 3.25 billion people resulting in approximately US$1.63 trillion in economic losses.
Much of the difference is explained by a rise in climate-related disasters including extreme weather events: from 3,656 climate-related events (1980-1999) to 6,681 climate-related disasters in the period 2000-2019.
The last twenty years has seen the number of major floods more than double, from 1,389 to 3,254, while the incidence of storms grew from 1,457 to 2,034. Floods and storms were the most prevalent events.
The report “The Human Cost of Disasters 2000-2019” also records major increases in other categories including drought, wildfires and extreme temperature events. There has also been a rise in geo-physical events including earthquakes and tsunamis which have killed more people than any of the other natural hazards under review in this report.
Mami Mizutori, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, said today: “We are willfully destructive. That is the only conclusion one can come to when reviewing disaster events over the last twenty years. COVID-19 is but the latest proof that political and business leaders are yet to tune in to the world around them.
“Disaster management agencies, civil protection departments, fire brigades, public health authorities, the Red Cross and Red Crescent, and many NGOs are fighting an uphill battle against an ever-rising tide of extreme weather events. More lives are being saved but more people are being affected by the expanding climate emergency. Disaster risk is becoming systemic with one event overlapping and influencing another in ways that are testing our resilience to the limit. The odds are being stacked against us when we fail to act on science and early warnings to invest in prevention, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.
“Good disaster risk governance depends on political leadership and delivery on the promises made when the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction were adopted five years ago. The report is a reminder to UN Member States of their commitment to strengthen disaster risk governance and to have national and local strategies for disaster risk reduction in place by 2020. This is a key target of the global blueprint for reducing disaster losses, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which was adopted at a World Conference in 2015. So far, 93 countries have put national strategies in place.”
Professor Debarati Guha-Sapir, Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, University of Louvain, Belgium, said: “This report covers the first twenty years of this century and does not include biological hazards like COVID-19 but it clearly highlights the level of human suffering and economic loss that result from failure to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If this level of growth in extreme weather events continues over the next twenty years, the future of mankind looks very bleak indeed.
“We will have to live with the consequences of existing levels of climate change for a long time to come and there are many practical measures that can be taken to reduce the burden of disaster losses especially on low and middle-income countries that lack resources and are most exposed to economic losses on a scale that undermines their efforts to eradicate poverty and to provide good quality social services including health and education.”
KEY STATISTICS: 2000-2019
The statistics in this report are from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) which records disasters which have killed ten or more people; affected 100 or more people; resulted in a declared state of emergency; or a call for international assistance.
Asia suffered the highest number of disaster events. In total, between 2000 and 2019, there were 3,068 disaster events in Asia, followed by the 1,756 events in the Americas and 1,192 events in Africa.
In terms of affected countries globally, China (577 events) and the USA (467 events) reported the highest number of disaster events, followed by India (321 events), Philippines (304 events), and Indonesia (278 events). These countries all have large and heterogenous landmasses and relatively high population densities in at-risk areas.
Overall, eight of the top 10 countries by disaster events are in Asia.
The years 2004, 2008, and 2010 stand out most, having had over 200,000 deaths each. The largest single event by death toll was the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, 226,400 deaths; the second largest event occurred in 2010, when a 7.0 Richter earthquake struck Haiti in the middle of the night, killing approximately 222,000 people and leaving millions  homeless. In 2008,  Cyclone Nargis killed  over 138,000 people in Myanmar. The average number of deaths worldwide from 2000 to 2019 was approximately 60,000 deaths per year. Since 2010 there have been no mega-disasters (100,000 deaths) and no single year with over 35,000 deaths.
About UNDRR: UNDRR is the United Nations office dedicated to disaster risk reduction. It is led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and supports implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 - 2030 which seeks “the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses, in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries.”

Title: Region’s leaders gather to chart WHO’s work in the Western Pacific
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
12 October 2020
Health ministers and senior officials from countries and areas across Asia and the Pacific gathered virtually from 6 to 9 October to agree actions on health issues in the region and chart priorities for the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Western Pacific.
On the opening day, WHO briefed countries on the COVID-19 situation in the Region and its work to support responses. Delegates shared updates on the current situation and needs.
In his opening remarks, Dr Takeshi Kasai, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, said “Last year, we gathered in Manila and talked about how, together, we would work towards addressing the challenges facing our Region in the future. None of us could have imagined how quickly the future would arrive. COVID-19 is the most challenging public health event we have seen in 100 years – and it is testing not only the capacity of our health systems, but also the resilience of our societies and economies. But I’m proud of the spirit of solidarity that has characterized interactions between countries of our Region over the past 9 months. In these difficult times, countries have come together in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration – borne out of a recognition that no country in our Region is safe until every country is safe.”
WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a video message for the Region’s health ministers: “The COVID-19 pandemic has upended our health systems, societies, and economies. This new virus may have originated in the Western Pacific, but so far, your region has reported the fewest cases and deaths. This is no accident. Many countries in the Western Pacific Region are an example for the rest of the world of the long-term benefits of investing in emergency preparedness and response. Through painful past experience, many of your countries have developed a strong 'muscle memory' that has helped you to prevent infections and save lives. But all countries must remain vigilant. The virus is still circulating and most people remain susceptible.”
Later in the week, health ministers and senior officials deliberated to address:
Dr Francisco T. Duque III, Secretary of Health of the Philippines, was elected Chair of this year’s session. Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete, Minister of Health and Medical Services of Fiji, was elected Vice Chair.

Title: UN Secretary-General's Message on World Mental Health Day, 10 October
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
08 October 2020
Around the world, nearly 1 billion people live with a mental disorder.  Every 40 seconds, someone dies from suicide.  And depression is now recognized as a leading cause of illness and disability among children and adolescents.
All of this was true, even before COVID-19.  We are now seeing the consequences of the pandemic on people’s mental well-being, and this is just the beginning.  Many groups, including older adults, women, children and people with existing mental health conditions are at risk of considerable medium- and long-term ill-health if action is not taken.
Addressing mental health is central to achieving Universal Health Coverage.  It deserves our commitment.  Too few people have access to quality mental health services.  In low- and middle-income countries, more than 75 per cent of people with mental health conditions receive no treatment at all.  And, overall, governments spend on average less than 2 per cent of their health budgets on mental health.  This cannot go on.
We can no longer ignore the need for a massive scale-up in investment in mental health.  We must act together, now, to make quality mental health care available for all who need it to allow us to recover faster from the COVID-19 crisis.

Title: UN Secretary-General's Message on the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, 13 October
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
08 October 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought renewed attention to the importance of strengthening disaster risk reduction.
Many countries are facing multiple crises simultaneously.
We will see more of this.
Extreme weather events have risen dramatically over the past two decades.
Yet, we have seen little progress on reducing climate disruption and environmental degradation.
Bad situations only get worse without good disaster risk governance.
Disaster risk isn’t the sole responsibility of local and national authorities.
COVID-19 has shown us that systemic risk requires international cooperation.
Good disaster risk governance means acting on science and evidence.
And that requires political commitment at the highest level to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
To eradicate poverty and reduce the impacts of climate change, we must place the public good above all other considerations.
For these reasons and more, this year’s International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is all about strengthening disaster risk governance to build a safer and more resilient world.

Title: Secretary-General's message launching the Policy Brief: COVID-19 and Universal Health Care
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
07 October 2020
[You may watch the video message here]
[Download the Policy Brief here]
Nine months since we first heard of COVID-19, the pandemic has claimed more than one million lives and infected more than 30 million people in 190 countries. Infections are rising and there are troubling signs of new waves.
 
Much about the virus remains unknown. But one basic fact is clear: the world was not prepared.
The pandemic has revealed utterly inadequate health systems, yawning gaps in social protection, and major structural inequalities within and between countries.
We must all draw the hard lessons of this crisis.
One of those lessons is that under-investment in health can have a devastating impact on societies and economies.
The pandemic is costing the global economy $375 billion a month. Some 500 million jobs have been lost so far. Human development is going into reverse, for the first time since we started measuring it in 1990.
COVID-19 has shown that Universal Health Coverage, strong public health systems and emergency preparedness are essential to communities, to economies, to everyone.
That is the backdrop to the Policy Brief we are launching today.
At least half the world’s people do not have access to the health services they need. Some 100 million people are driven into poverty each year by catastrophic health-care costs.
This huge gap in health coverage is one reason why COVID-19 has caused so much pain and suffering.
Universal Health Coverage requires governments to step up investment in common goods for health, including surveillance and risk communication, so that the world never faces such a situation again.
It also requires public health programmes to be inclusive and equitable, without financial barriers. Health treatment should not depend on financial status.
All countries have agreed to work towards Universal Health Coverage as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
But we cannot wait 10 years. We need Universal Health Coverage, including mental health coverage, now, to strengthen efforts against the pandemic and prepare for future crises.
That is just one of the five major recommendations in this policy brief.
The second is to control further transmission of COVID-19 through proven public health measures and a coordinated global response.
The third recommendation is to protect delivery of other health services during the pandemic. COVID-19 is indirectly killing people with heart disease and cancer, as well as those it infects. And access to mental health services and sexual and reproductive health programmes cannot be compromised.
Fourth, we need to ensure everyone, everywhere has access to future COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatment. Funding the groundbreaking ACT-Accelerator is the fastest way to end the pandemic.
And fifth, we must strengthen preparedness. That means involving all sectors of society, and investing in alert systems that trigger action by health authorities.
Pandemic preparedness and response are global public goods that require large-scale investments.
Universal Health Coverage comes at a cost. But the price is cheap, when we consider the alternative.
I urge all to speed up and scale up investment in Universal Health Coverage and in stronger health systems, starting immediately.

Title: MSME Sector is key to COVID-19 inclusive recovery for PH
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
02 October 2020
Manila, Philippines – Despite the lifting of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Metro Manila, majority of the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are still temporarily closed or are operating at decreased capacity—an indicator of the difficulties they are facing in getting back to their business operations according to the recent survey conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on the impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs in the Philippines.
MSMEs comprise 99.5% of business establishments in the Philippines and are employing approximately 63% of the country's workforce. In the past years, MSMEs were responsible for 40% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). During the second quarter of 2020 and almost four months since the community quarantine was put in place, the country’s GDP sank to 16.5% as the Philippines experienced recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the first MSME online forum organized by the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF) and UNDP Philippines through SIKAP (Synergizing Recovery Initiatives, Knowledge, and Adaptation Practices for MSMEs), the results of the survey were presented to more than 170 MSME owners and development organizations.
The survey also showed that out of the 285 respondents, 81% reported experiencing low consumer demand. This low demand alongside shortages related to transportation and logistics, and lack of financing capacity were cited as the primary challenges of MSME owners in resuming their operations.
Since the implementation of community lockdowns, MSMEs continued to suffer from disrupted cashflow and continuing expenses, which led to income losses. Close to 80% of the respondents reported a reduction in their average monthly income from April to June compared to their average monthly income prior to the pandemic. While 20% of the respondents tried to retain employees with full pay despite income losses, their cashflow was so severely affected that 25% of them began to lay off employees.
“We are in the middle of a once in a lifetime medical emergency. I know you are worried about your health, scared to open your businesses. But for the sake of our families and ourselves, we have to take that step and reopen while maintaining safety standards. We have to find a way to keep going as long as we need to," said Butch Meily, President of PDRF.
To address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, MSMEs started implementing adaptive business measures. Among which are digitalization or the use of online platforms for their business transactions, cost reduction, diversification of products and services, utilization of non-cash payment options, and allowing employees to work from home.  However, despite these adaptive measures, majority of the MSMEs still need assistance to recover from their losses. At least 60% of the respondents reported that they have not received any assistance from any stakeholder (gov't, private sector, NGOs, and others) yet. Among the most pressing needs of MSMEs are access to credit facilities, tax breaks, and deferred loan payments.
“MSMEs play a crucial role in the Philippines’ efforts to recover from the crisis brought about by this pandemic. UNDP will continue to support Government and its development partners to facilitate their sector representation in policy dialogues and program planning so as to capitalize on available solutions that could prevent further closures of MSMEs. We are also working very closely with the private sector to provide online resources and to ensure that all MSMEs can get the right access to e-commerce trainings to support their digital transition. Digital infrastructure in the country is key to enable the development of a new market space online,” said Enrico Gaveglia, Officer-in-Charge of UNDP Philippines.
The result of the survey intended to provide data-driven recommendations that can help the Inter-Agency Task Force come up with more effective policies and programs that are responsive to the immediate and long-term needs of MSMEs.
Among these recommendations were the integration of MSMEs in public sector procurement, a balanced and complementing mix of monetary and fiscal policies including wide-reaching government guarantees for MSME lending that will support overall spending, and mechanisms to increase household consumption in the country.  Other recommendations included addressing the challenges in public transportation to ensure safe and efficient mobility of people, products, and services, and the strengthening of supply chain management by integrating more local suppliers.

Title: Fighting two pandemics hand in hand in Asia and the Pacific
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
07 September 2020
Global hunger has been on a regrettable rise in recent years, and despite Asia’s economic clout, the continent – home to more than half of the world’s undernourished – has not been spared. Now COVID-19 is leading to a slow-down of regional economic growth and further threatening food security.
Southern Asia is particularly vulnerable, with the number of chronically underfed people projected to rise by almost a third to 330 million by 2030. It is also the only subregion in the world, where more than half the children from the poorest fifth of society are stunted, a condition that prejudices their futures. But there are challenges all around: The Pacific Island States have the world’s highest child wasting rates, and East Asia has the world’s highest absolute costs for a healthy diet – one that goes beyond mere calorie counts to offer balanced nutrition. On top of that, Asia and the Pacific is the region where obesity and overweight, for children and adults, are growing faster than anywhere else.
We are facing two pandemics. COVID-19, which beyond its health toll is crushing livelihoods, and hunger, a scourge the international community pledged to eradicate by the end of this decade – the Sustainable Development Goal 2.
Tackling them will require new ideas and more robust political will. Past progress was sustained by the benign trickle-down effects of strong economies. This is not the case anymore.
The facts have changed, and so must our minds.
We need to find ways to increase resilience across our food systems by identifying new marketing channels (like e-commerce), increasing efficiency to reduce losses, improve the quality of products available and storage facilities, which are critical to flows of healthy foods and income to those who produce them. Inclusive access to finance to strengthen and expand rural supply chains is also crucial.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has recently launched a new comprehensive COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme to provide an agile and coordinated global response aimed at ensuring access to nutritious food for everyone by mobilizing all forms of resources and partnerships at country, regional and global level. In line with the UN agenda to “build back better”, and in pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the new comprehensive COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme aims to mitigate the immediate impacts of the pandemic while strengthening the longer-term resilience of food systems and livelihoods.
So we are making headway, but we must, as a priority, attend to the most urgent issues at the very source by enabling farmers to be more dynamic, entrepreneurial and competitive through continual innovation.
We need smallholder farmers to produce nutritious foods, without fear of crop failures, and we need to get those foods to the mouths of the hungry across the region and beyond. To do this, smallholders desperately need access to financial resources, technology and innovation. We also need to educate people on the importance of healthy diets, so that farmers will have a solid base of demand to whom they can market those foods.
The Asia-Pacific region is as dynamic as it is large. It has some of the best agricultural scientists, institutions and innovative ideas. From Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific to China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and virtually every country in between, innovators are proving that everyone can benefit from new technologies and science.
Examples range from deploying drones to monitor flood and pest risks, smartphone apps that can identify plant diseases, advanced genetics that build on crop and livestock breeding, precision agriculture and aquaculture systems that conserve natural resources such as water, indoor farming and consumer tools for nutrition monitoring and smart purchasing.
There is no time to waste.  Everyone needs to lend a hand: governments, academia, the private sector, UN agencies, civil society organizations, international financial institutions and the people who bring us the food we eat – the smallholders. And our hands need to be working in unison to overcome pandemics that by definition affect and involve everyone.
FAO has rolled out the Hand-in-Hand Initiative to tackle these collective challenges, and the FAO Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific, which will be virtually hosted by Bhutan (1-4 September), is the perfect opportunity for forty-six Members and other partners to forge ways to expedite action and leverage resources.
By working together, learning together and contributing together, we can overcome both pandemics and transform the agri-food system.

Title: Digital finance, a lifeline during COVID-19 crisis, can deliver long-term financing of the Sustainable  Development Goals
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
27 August 2020
Download the Report here
New York City, 26 August - The unprecedented social and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the role of digital finance in providing relief for millions around the world, supporting businesses and protecting jobs and livelihoods.
While the pandemic demonstrates the immediate benefits of digital finance, the disruptive potential of digitalization in transforming finance is immense. Mobile payment technologies have transformed mobile phones into financial tools for more than a billion people. Digital is supporting big data and artificial intelligence in advancing cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding platforms, and online marketplaces. Banks have invested over US$1 trillion in developing, integrating and acquiring emerging technologies. In 2018, ‘fintech’ investment reached US$120 billion, one third of global venture capital funding.
Today a new report, “People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future”, by the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance sets out an ambitious, practical Action Agenda. Centrally, it spells out how digital finance can be harnessed in ways that empower citizens as tax-payers and investors in envisaging a digital transformation at scale that better aligns people’s money with their needs, collectively expressed by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The report highlights how billions of people around the world are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic using digital tools to work, spend and socialize. It argues there is an historic opportunity to harness digitalization in placing citizens, the ultimate owners of the world's financial resources, in control of finance to ensure that it meets their needs, today and in the future.
The Task Force identifies five catalytic opportunities for harnessing digitalization in aligning financing with the SDGs. Together they cover much of global finance:
The Task Force’s Action Agenda is a call to action to businesses, policy-makers and those governing finance to do what it takes to deliver on these opportunities. It spells out not only the ‘what’ but also the ‘how’: investments, new capabilities and governance innovations can get the job done.
The Task Force concludes that harnessing digitalization for the good is a choice, not an inevitability driven by technology.  Its Action Agenda points to actions needed to overcome digital risks that, unmitigated, could deepen exclusion, discrimination and inequalities, and separate finance further from the needs of an inclusive, sustainable development.
Leadership Quotes
UN Secretary-General, António Guterres said: “Digital technologies, which are revolutionizing financial markets, can be a game-changer in meeting our shared objectives. The Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals provides leadership to harness the digital revolution.“
Maria Ramos, Co-Chair of the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance said: “We have an historic opportunity to accelerate and expand the transformative impact of digitalization. In particular, digital finance, which in this crisis became the lifeline for millions across the world, extends the boundaries of financial inclusion by empowering citizens as savers, investors, borrowers, lenders and tax-payers in a way that gives them choice and power over their money.”
Achim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP and Co-Chair of the UN Secretary-General’s Task Force on Digital Finance said: “Digital finance's dramatic potential for transformative impact is being revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital transfers enable governments to get support to people in need, crowdfunding platforms have mobilized funds for medical supplies and emergency relief, and algorithmic lending means small businesses have quicker access to funds. The speed of the recent spread of these technologies is astonishing, but progress is not automatic. For digitalization to be a true force for delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals, technological advances must combine with sound policy that empowers citizens and enables our financial system to meet the urgent investment challenges that must be overcome to build forward better.”

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks to launch the Report by the Task Force on the Digital Financing of the SDGs
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
27 August 2020
NEW YORK, 26 AUGUST 2020, 10:00 am
(As delivered)
Excellencies, Distinguished Members of the Task Force on Digital Financing of the SDGs, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The COVID-19 pandemic has strained public health systems and disrupted national and local economies. It is already pushing tens of millions of people into extreme poverty and exacerbating inequalities of all kinds.
In the midst of this turmoil, digital technology is a critical lifeline, enabling billions of people to maintain connections with loved ones, buy daily necessities, preserve their livelihoods and receive government assistance.
From mobile payments to crowdfunding, digital technology is already helping to meet development challenges. As we begin the Decade of Action to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, it can be a critical enabler, kick-starting the transformative changes we need to create stronger, more resilient and inclusive communities and societies on a healthy planet.
That is the background to my decision in late 2018 to establish a high-level Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals.
I asked the Task Force to explore the nexus of digital technology, finance and the SDGs, complementing the work of the High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation.
I wanted to explore how digital innovation can put more of the $380 trillion in assets managed by the global financial system, and the many trillions channeled through governments, at the service of people and planet.
The Task Force’s report, People’s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future, sets out an ambitious but achievable set of recommendations that could make a major difference in achieving our collective global goals.
I urge everyone to study the recommendations closely and consider how we can take them forward together.
I thank the Task Force members for their insights, energy and investment of time, especially during the pandemic, and express my particular gratitude to Achim Steiner and Maria Ramos for their leadership.
I also thank the Governments of Germany, Italy and Switzerland for their generous support, and the many Member States, institutions and individuals that contributed to the report’s findings.
Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,
The Task Force has set out five catalytic opportunities to move public and private money into alignment with the SDGs. There is work to be done on all of these.
But what has truly drawn my attention is the conclusion that digitalization will make a difference by giving people greater control over how global finance – their own money – is used.
Whether it is channeled through markets or through state intermediaries, global finance is accountable to ordinary people. Taxpayers hold governments to account, while savers and investors need to hold financial institutions to account.
And people, whether they are taxpayers, savers or investors, care deeply about their families, communities and our planet.
So I fully endorse the Task Force’s vision of citizen-centric finance, and its conclusion that the digitalization of finance must be inclusive and empowering so that it becomes a force for good.
Currently, 3.6 billion people worldwide – including a disproportionate number of women – lack the resources and capabilities to take advantage of the digital world.
Addressing this gap will contribute to the economic resilience of communities and national economies. It will also address gender inequality by enabling women to have greater power over how they make, spend, save, and control their money.
Today’s report also highlights the importance of institutional arrangements to steer digital finance into alignment with the SDGs.  The continued dislocation between our collective commitment to the SDGs, and decision-making around public financing, cannot continue.
The Task Force therefore recommends strengthening the links between the governance of finance, including its transformative digital aspects, and policy goals and citizens’ interests.
Much can be done at the local and national level. But international cooperation is needed to make a real difference, and that cooperation cannot be confined to yesterday’s clubs of influential actors.
Digitalization must democratize the governance of finance, in order to democratize finance itself. Developing countries need and deserve a much greater role in formulating the policies and decisions that will impact their citizens.
Excellencies, dear friends,
Thanks to the Task Force, and to the many others who have taken part in formulating this powerful report, we now have an ambitious set of ideas to deliver financing for the Sustainable Development Goals, by shifting the center of gravity of the financial system towards empowered citizens.
Working with Member States, we ourselves will be able to better harness digitalization in moving substantive resources to fund our own activities.
Our current initiative on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond is an opportunity to bring the recommendations of the Task Force forward. The recovery from the current crisis must be driven by investments in digital solutions that support inclusive, green, and sustainable growth.
The options that are being developed under our Financing for Development initiative must overcome the deepening digital divide, and ensure that digital technologies are a key component of financing for a sustainable recovery.
As Secretary General, I am fully committed to supporting the implementation of the recommendations in this report.
I urge the entire United Nations system and its partners to do likewise.
Thank you.

Title: Text of the Secretary-General's video remarks on the launch of his Policy Brief on Tourism and COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
26 August 2020
Watch the video remarks here
Tourism is one of the world’s most important economic sectors.
It employs one in every ten people on Earth and provides livelihoods to hundreds of millions more.
It boosts economies and enables countries to thrive.
It allows people to experience some of the world’s cultural and natural riches and brings people closer to each other, highlighting our common humanity.
Indeed, one might say that tourism is itself one of the wonders of the world.
That is why it has been so painful to see how tourism has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the first five months of this year, international tourist arrivals decreased by more than half and some $320 billion dollars in exports from tourism were lost.
Overall, some 120 million direct jobs in tourism are at risk.
Many are in the informal economy or in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ a high proportion of women and young people.
The crisis is a major shock for developed economies, but for developing countries, it is an emergency, particularly for many small island developing states and African countries.
For women, rural communities, indigenous peoples and many other historically marginalized populations, tourism has been a vehicle for integration, empowerment and generating income.
Tourism is also a key pillar for the conservation of natural and cultural heritage.
The fall in revenues has led to increased poaching and habitat destruction in and around protected areas, and the closure of many World Heritage Sites has deprived communities of vital livelihoods.
It is imperative that we rebuild the tourism sector.
But it must be in a way that is safe, equitable and climate friendly.
Transport-related greenhouse gas emissions could rebound sharply if recovery is not aligned with climate goals.
Supporting the millions of livelihoods that depend on tourism means building a sustainable and responsible travel experience that is safe for host communities, workers and travellers.
To aid recovery, I have identified five priority areas.
First, mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the crisis.
Second, build resilience across the entire tourism value chain.
Third, maximize the use of technology in the tourism sector.
Fourth, promote sustainability and green growth.
And fifth, foster partnerships to enable tourism to further support the Sustainable Development Goals.
Let us ensure tourism regains its position as a provider of decent jobs, stable incomes and the protection of our cultural and natural heritage.
Thank you.

Title: Saving the economy or saving lives: An unnecessary choice
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
26 August 2020
With the decision made in the very early morning of 18 August to revert to the General Community Quarantine (GCQ) in Metro Manila, we are again seeing social media light up with polarized views on whether we should prioritize the health of citizens or the health of the economy.  Presented as a binary choice and wrapped in understandable emotion, it represents a conundrum of considerable significance to policy makers.  It may take more than the wisdom of Solomon to balance the legitimate concerns of exhausted health workers and those who are seeing their livelihoods vanish before their eyes.  But need it be so?  Can more rigorous analysis of at least the key numbers underlining an issue of such importance help make an informed decision?
As the first application of UNDP’s new Pintig (heartbeat in Filipino) data Lab, we worked with the Ateneo de Manila University Department of Economics’ FASSSTER socioeconomic modelling working group to take a closer look at the critical figures that could help resolve what we consider to be a false dichotomy between the economy and saving lives. We adopted a multivariate approach, combining health data with a socioeconomic analysis of estimated costs in terms of lives, livelihoods, and revenues. This data was then used to project the health and socioeconomic impacts on Metro Manila under different quarantine scenarios over the period of 4 to 31 August 2020.
To account for the socioeconomic impact of different lockdown scenarios over this period, we broadly examined the health costs and economic losses associated with the different quarantine levels. Specifically, we zeroed-in on treatment costs for the infected and sick, and the additional personnel and equipment costs.  We also estimated the short- and long-term economic losses.  We derived our figures on COVID-19 cases and health system requirements from the FASSSTER Susceptible-Exposed- Infected-Recovered model for COVID-19. However, compared to reported cases for ‘deaths’, we assumed that projected ‘critical cases’ beyond maximum available ICU facilities for COVID- 19 patients among Metro Manila hospitals are likely to be added to the count of the deceased. Secondly, we estimated the share of displaced workers in Metro Manila for each community quarantine scenario from the Philippine Statistics Authority’s (PSA) Labor Force Surveys, and thereafter used these labor force displacement rates to estimate the lost economic output of different lockdown levels.
The findings suggest that the adoption of a Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) has only a temporary effect on containing the spread of the virus and will most certainly continue to devastate the economy.  A return to GCQ however can be more effective IF combined with significantly strengthened testing, tracing, isolation and treatment.   Compliance of the general public to health guidance is also critical.
While an MECQ applied over a month and based on current health facility capacity will have reduced COVID cases by around 28,722 persons by the end of August, it would have a scarring effect on the economy, with an additional 461,000 workers projected to be displaced. These labor losses, in turn, will cost the NCR economy approximately 10.7 billion pesos per day.  With an economy already contracting by 16.6 percent year-on year in the second quarter, these are numbers we cannot afford.  However, we equally do not need to put more lives at risk.
Currently, Metro Manila’s healthcare capacity in terms of testing, tracing, and isolation is operating at what FASSSTER have noted is 19% capacity. However, if this is increased to 33%, the number of days it takes to identify and isolate positive individuals improves from 5 days to 3 days; and if there was at least a 50% compliance with wearing face masks and face shields, this would make GCQ the least costly lockdown type.
From a health perspective, we see an immediate reduction in the transmission rate.  If we were to fast forward to 31 October 2020, we would see that a GCQ with a healthcare capacity at 33% and strong compliance with social distancing and wearing of facemasks and shields, can contribute to flattening the curve.  Metro Manila would then see only an increase in 661 cases between August 31 – October 31, as opposed to 51,480 with the capacity remaining at just 19%. From an economic perspective, losses would be reduced form 10.7 billion pesos per day to 9.5 billion pesos per day as at end of August. One could expect this number to reduce further as the virus transmission rate is arrested and the economy is allowed to open up further.
As indicated above, while an MECQ or ECQ can certainly slow down the rate of infection and deaths for the period that they are applied, our projections show that they are imperfect, devastatingly costly, and rather blunt policy instruments for stemming the COVID-19 surge in cases. Major gains in reducing the cost to the economy and health of the citizens could come from effective action related to enhanced testing, contact tracing, and isolation, coupled with compliance of the general public to health guidance. Success also hinges on proactiveness. This means acting quickly and in a very targeted way based on strong data, identifying emerging hotspots, and taking appropriate measures.
The modelling we have undertaken and the option we have suggested can in no way compensate for the immense pain and physical and emotional exhaustion felt by individuals and families as they confront the real tragedies of losing lives and losing jobs.  We know very well that there is a risk of appearing callous in trying to simplify complex problems to models and curves.  But robust data analysis can help us make difficult choices and help us avoid making unnecessary binary decisions about whether to drive the economy into the ground while saving thousands of lives or revive the economy while sacrificing thousands of lives.  There need not be an either-or trade-off; the numbers show that there is a possible middle way.
(The modelling above will be regularly updated by The PINTIG Lab and FASSSTER and provided to the IATF in the form of a policy note on a monthly basis. The findings from the next analysis is due in the last week of September and will be published on the UNDP Philippines website.)

Title: New ILO-ADB report addresses the impact of COVID-19 on youth employment in Asia and the Pacific
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
18 August 2020
Bangkok (ILO news) – Young people’s employment prospects in Asia and the Pacific are severely challenged as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Youth (15–24 years) will be hit harder than adults (25 and older) in the immediate crisis and also risk bearing higher longer-term economic and social costs, says a new ILO-ADB report.
‘Tackling the COVID-19 youth employment crisis in Asia and the Pacific ’, by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and Asian Development Bank (ADB), calls on governments in the region to adopt urgent, large-scale and targeted measures to generate jobs for youth, keep education and training on track, and to minimize future scarring of more than 660 million young people in the region.
Even before the COVID-19 crisis, youth in Asia and the Pacific faced challenges in the labour market resulting in high unemployment rates and large shares of youth excluded from both school and work. In 2019, the regional youth unemployment rate was 13.8 per cent compared to 3.0 per cent for adults, and more than 160 million youth (24 per cent of the population) were not in employment, education or training (NEET). Four in five young workers in the region were engaged in informal employment – a higher share than among adults – and one in four young workers was living in conditions of extreme or moderate poverty.
“The pre-crisis challenges for youth are now amplified since COVID-19 hit. Without sufficient attention, our fear is that this risks creating a ‘lockdown generation’ that could feel the weight of this crisis for many years to come,” says Sara Elder, a lead author of the report and Head of the ILO Regional Economic and Social Analysis unit.
The report cites three ways in which young people are affected in the current crisis: (1) job disruptions in the form of reduced working hours and earnings, and job losses for both paid workers and the self-employed; (2) disruptions in their education and training; and (3) difficulties in transitioning from school to work, and moving between jobs in a recession.
Youth unemployment rates in the region increased sharply in the first quarter of 2020 from the last quarter of 2019. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, the youth unemployment rate increased in six of the nine economies with available data: Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Viet Nam, as well as in Hong Kong, China, which showed the largest increase of 3 percentage points. In all these economies, youth rates increased more than adult rates.

Title: Secretary-General's Video Message at the Launch of the Policy Brief on Education During COVID-19 and Beyond
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
04 August 2020
Download the video message here.
Download the Policy Brief here.
Education is the key to personal development and the future of societies.
It unlocks opportunities and narrows inequalities.
It is the bedrock of informed, tolerant societies, and a primary driver of sustainable development.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the largest disruption of education ever.
In mid-July, schools were closed in more than 160 countries, affecting over 1 billion students.
At least 40 million children worldwide have missed out on education in their critical pre-school year.
And parents, especially women, have been forced to assume heavy care burdens in the home.
Despite the delivery of lessons by radio, television and online, and the best efforts of teachers and parents, many students remain out of reach.
Learners with disabilities, those in minority or disadvantaged communities, displaced and refugee students and those in remote areas are at highest risk of being left behind.
And even for those who can access distance learning, success depends on their living conditions, including the fair distribution of domestic duties.
We already faced a learning crisis before the pandemic.
More than 250 million school-age children were out of school.
And only a quarter of secondary school children in developing countries were leaving school with basic skills.
Now we face a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities.
The knock-on effects on child nutrition, child marriage and gender equality, among others, are deeply concerning.
This is the backdrop to the Policy Brief I am launching today, together with a new campaign with education partners and United Nations agencies called ‘Save our Future’.
We are at a defining moment for the world’s children and young people.
The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people, and on the development prospects of countries for decades to come.
This Policy Brief calls for action in four key areas:
First, reopening schools.
Once local transmission of COVID-19 is under control, getting students back into schools and learning institutions as safely as possible must be a top priority.
We have issued guidance to help governments in this complex endeavour.
It will be essential to balance health risks against risks to children’s education and protection, and to factor in the impact on women’s labour force participation.
Consultation with parents, carers, teachers and young people is fundamental.
Second, prioritizing education in financing decisions.
Before the crisis hit, low and middle-income countries already faced an education funding gap of $1.5 trillion dollars a year.
This gap has now grown.
Education budgets need to be protected and increased.
And it is critical that education is at the heart of international solidarity efforts, from debt management and stimulus packages to global humanitarian appeals and official development assistance.
Third, targeting the hardest to reach.
Education initiatives must seek to reach those at greatest risk of being left behind -- people in emergencies and crises; minority groups of all kinds; displaced people and those with disabilities.
They should be sensitive to the specific challenges faced by girls, boys, women and men, and should urgently seek to bridge the digital divide.
Fourth, the future of education is here.
We have a generational opportunity to reimagine education.
We can take a leap towards forward-looking systems that deliver quality education for all as a springboard for the Sustainable Development Goals.
To achieve this, we need investment in digital literacy and infrastructure, an evolution towards learning how to learn, a rejuvenation of life-long learning and strengthened links between formal and non-formal education.
And we need to draw on flexible delivery methods, digital technologies and modernized curricula while ensuring sustained support for teachers and communities.
As the world faces unsustainable levels of inequality, we need education – the great equalizer – more than ever.
We must take bold steps now, to create inclusive, resilient, quality education systems fit for the future.

Title: Statement of the Secretary-General on the launch of the Policy Brief on the Impact of COVID-19 on Southeast Asia
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
30 July 2020
As in other parts of the world, the health, economic and political impact of COVID-19 has been significant across Southeast Asia — hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.
The pandemic has highlighted deep inequalities, shortfalls in governance and the imperative for a sustainable development pathway.
And it has revealed new challenges, including to peace and security.
Containment measures have spared Southeast Asia the degree of suffering and upheaval seen elsewhere.
Governments acted swiftly to battle the pandemic and avoid its worst effects. And regional cooperation has been robust across multiple sectors.
Throughout the crisis, the United Nations has been supporting response and recovery efforts.
We are providing medical supplies, supporting social protection programmes, assisting returning migrants and addressing the surge in violence against women and children.
Looking ahead, four areas will be critical in the region’s plans for recovery.
First, tackling inequality in income, health care and social protection – in short-term stimulus measures as well as long-term policy changes.
Second, bridging the digital divide -- to ensure that people and communities are not left behind in our ever-more-connected world.
Third, greening the economy -- to create the jobs of the future and to decarbonize economies still too dependent on coal and other industries of the past.
Fourth, upholding human rights, protecting civic space and promoting transparency -- which are all intrinsic to an effective response.
Central to these efforts is the need to advance gender equality, address upsurges in gender-based violence, and target women in all aspects of economic recovery and stimulus plans.
This will mitigate the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on women, and is also one of the surest avenues to sustainable, rapid, and inclusive recovery for all.
The current situation is leading to recession and social tensions.
Already, hate speech has increased and political processes have stalled, leaving several long-running conflicts to stagnate and fester.
All governments in the subregion have supported my appeal for a global ceasefire — and I count on all countries in Southeast Asia to translate that commitment into meaningful change on the ground.
The region has much work to do – but has formidable capacities at its disposal.
The United Nations is strongly committed to our partnership with the countries of Southeast Asia, and we will continue to support efforts to get the region on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and build a peaceful future for all.
Thank you.

Title: UN Secretary-General's Message for Nelson Mandela International Day, 18 July 2020
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
13 July 2020
Each year, on Nelson’s Mandela’s birthday, we pay tribute to an extraordinary global advocate for equality, dignity and solidarity.
Madiba was a moral giant of the 20th century, whose timeless legacy continues to guide us today.
The theme of Nelson Mandela International Day is “Take action, inspire change”.
It highlights the importance of working together, from governments to citizens, to build a peaceful, sustainable and equitable world.
We mark this day at a time when the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic endangers everyone, everywhere, and especially the most vulnerable.
In the face of these challenges, world leaders need to recognize the vital importance of unity and solidarity.
COVID-19 is exposing deep inequalities.
We need to fight this pandemic of inequality through a new social contract for a new era.
Only together can we fend off the common threat of COVID and recover better.
As the United Nations marks its 75th anniversary in this fragile time, we reflect on the life and work of Nelson Mandela, who embodied the highest values of the United Nations and who took action and inspired change.
Despite many years as a prisoner of conscience, Madiba retained his dignity and commitment to his ideals.
Let his example propel any governments that keep such prisoners to release them.
There should be no prisoners of conscience in the 21st century.
Nelson Mandela reminded us that: “As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality persist in our world, none of us can truly rest.”
On this Mandela Day, let us recall that we can, and must, be part of the quest for a better future of dignity, opportunity and prosperity for all people on a healthy planet.

Title: Why gender equality should be at the heart of the COVID-19 recovery
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
11 July 2020
Globally, some 650 million women and girls alive today were married as children. Another 33,000 children are forced into marriage every single day. More than 200 million women and girls are affected by female genital mutilation (FGM), with four million currently at risk in 2020 alone. And more than 140 million females are considered missing today, as a consequence of gender biased pre- and post-natal sex selection in favour of boys. These alarming figures, just published in the UN Population Fund’s State of World Population report for 2020, should serve as a call to action as we commemorate World Population Day, 11 July, with the theme of “Putting the brakes on COVID-19: how to safeguard the health and rights of women and girls now” .
Individuals, communities and governments are currently under enormous strain worldwide. COVID-19 is pushing health systems to the brink, forcing travel restrictions and other compelling measures, and producing major social and economic disruptions that threaten to erase progress across a the various human development indicators. But for all the challenges, the current crisis also offers a unique opportunity: to reprioritise people—the collective “us”—as we combat the pandemic and chart a better path forward for the post-COVID-19 future.
It is now more critical than ever to bolster social protection systems with special focus on society’s most vulnerable. We must advocate strongly on behalf of gender equality, and devote extra attention and resources to the specific needs of women and girls—too often sidelined in crisis response and recovery planning. After all, gender equality in the workforce has a proven positive impact on economic growth. Countries that educate women see lower levels of poverty. And gender equality is a primary predictor of peace. Simply put, in societies where women and girls thrive, everyone is better off.
The UN Population Fund report, Against my will - Defying the practices that harm women and girls and undermine equality highlights three key practices that undermine progress toward global gender equality: child marriage, FGM, and parents’ and societies’ preference for sons over daughters. All three reinforce negative attitudes about women and girls, and exacerbate gender inequality. According to projections, if the pandemic causes a one- and two-year respective delay in the implementation of programmes designed to end child marriage and FGM, it could lead to 7.4 million more child marriages and 2 million more FGM cases occurring over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted.
In addition, we know from prior experience that disease outbreaks have differing effects on women and men, heightening the pre-existing underlying gender inequality and discrimination. In crisis contexts including the current COVID-19 pandemic, women and girls suffer higher rates of domestic violence and other forms of abuse. They are forced to take on increased childcare responsibilities and face more interruptions in work since women typically hold more precarious, informal jobs than men. Women and girls also face disruptions in access to sexual and reproductive health services. And with women representing 70% of the global health and social services workforce, they are more at risk of infection to disease, including COVID-19.
According to the report, the Philippines scores higher than the region and world in terms of laws and regulations that guarantee access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. However, it performs below than both the region and world in certain effective outcomes, including the unmet need for family planning. On child marriage, the Philippines showed a lower rate (17%) over the past fifteen years of women aged 20-24 who were married or in a union before age 18 as compared to the average for the Asia-Pacific region (26%) and the world as a whole (20%). Although encouraging in relative terms, this should not be cause for celebration. Child marriage is a root cause and symptom of gender inequality, and must be eradicated completely.
The path forward will not be easy. But there are several concrete steps we can take to meet this challenge. First, integrate the needs of female health workers into every aspect of the response. Second, reinforce protections against domestic violence through hotlines, services and law enforcement. Third, incorporate women-focused social protections into bailouts and stimulus packages. Fourth, include women in response and recovery decision-making at the local, municipal and national level. Fifth, seize this opportunity to “unstereotype” gender roles by encouraging equal domestic burden sharing within peoples’ homes. Sixth, collect and unpack data, with a view to really “leaving no one behind,” identifying and zooming into the most vulnerable among the vulnerable population, including internally displaced women, women with disabilities, women living with HIV/AIDS, LGBTQI as well.
The UN Country Team in the Philippines is actively supporting the government-led response to COVID-19, and working to ensure the inclusion and protection of women at every step. In partnership with the Department of Health and other government agencies, the UN is helping maintain sexual and reproductive health and family planning services, including the protection of health workers, striving to limit gender-based violence, and safeguarding the centrality of gender concerns in broader ongoing efforts to assist communities across the Philippines recovering from natural disaster and conflict, while promoting the maximum participation of women in the planning and execution of socio-economic recovery initiatives, for the Philippines to “heal as one” and “build back better”.
As we combat the COVID-19 pandemic, we must firmly prioritise gender equality at every step and at every level. Women and girls face unique challenges. But when their rights and futures are protected, the whole of society benefits.

Title: UNICEF statement on the killing of Fabel Pineda
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
07 July 2020
MANILA, 7 July 2020 – UNICEF condemns the murder of 15-year-old girl Fabel Pineda after filing a complaint against a policeman who molested her in custody for violating quarantine curfew. We mourn and condole with her family. Fabel’s death is made even more painful by the manner of her passing and the violence she suffered.
Society should never be accustomed to such egregious attacks against children. Every child has an inalienable right to live a life without violence and be treated by society with their best interest in mind.
As a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Philippines is duty-bound to uphold children’s right to life and to develop their potentials and capacities, to create a safe environment for children to be heard, and to protect children from all forms of violence.
When a child asserts her or his rights and reports wrongdoing against her or him, society should celebrate this act of courage by providing the child with access to justice and adequate support.
We recognize the Department of the Interior and Local Government and the Council for the Welfare of Children for timely releasing circulars and issuances that guarantee the protection of the rights and best interest of children during the community quarantine. We urge the Government to commit to increasing the capacity of its local police force and barangay workers to ensure that the full implementation of the law is done with child-sensitive protocols to fully safeguard our children and give them the physical, emotional, and psychological support.
UNICEF supports the statement of PNP chief General Archie Gamboa that the perpetrators must be held accountable for the heinous crime committed so that Fabel and her family will get the justice they deserve.
As we experience a new normal in this pandemic, let us not allow Fabel and countless children who are speaking out against violence to be silenced by our indifference and inaction. We hope that hereon, all children in need of protection and care will be heard and prioritized for swift action and empathetic response.

Title: Joint SDG Fund announces historic $US60 Million grant to close the SDG Financing Gap
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
06 July 2020
Today, the UN’s Joint SDG Fund announces a historical $US60 million grant to close the SDG financing gap.  The multi-year commitment, with an initial disbursement of $29 million being released this month, is considered the largest systemic UN led initiative on SDG financing in its history. With funding to be distributed across all continents, 40% will invest in Least Developed Countries and ten initiatives are to be implemented in Small Island Developing States.
“We have a historic opportunity to advocate for change, to curb inequalities and to invest in building resilience and sustainable development,” stated Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed at the recent SIDA Development Talks, Building back better – Finance and Development Leaders in Joint Ajuction[i].
The Joint SDG Fund is committed to supporting a coherent and cohesive UN system.  The investments in 62 Joint Programmes will offer pragmatic solutions, all assessed as relevant in the context of the COVID-19 crisis: from addressing  reduced fiscal space to align with the SDGs amidst COVID-19 recovery and financial planning to co-creating a new generation of risk-sensitive and responsive Integrated National Financing Frameworks. The results of the investment in SDG financing interventions will begin to materialize in the first quarter of 2021.
In March 2020, the Joint SDG Fund received 258 proposals to support SDG financing interventions in over 100 countries. The proposals were submitted to co-create a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) financing architecture at the national level and support countries by integrating the SDGs across national public financial systems and more effective public-private collaboration, ensuring that no one is left behind.
Mongolia’s Minister of Finance, Khurelbaatar commented, "The approval of the Joint Programme marks an important milestone in Mongolia's sustainable finance journey. The programme aims to catalyze more financial flows to deliver on the newly approved ambitious Vision-2050 by implementing several reforms that ensure better governance, coordination, and monitoring of integrated national SDG financing strategies. These strategies will also contribute to shaping a post-crisis future for Mongolia - one that is more resilient, inclusive, and ensuring gender equality. We highly appreciate the UN's timely support and partnership on this important initiative that will inspire local, regional and global stakeholders."
The current health and economic crisis are a unique opportunity to make the world more inclusive and sustainable and this unique opportunity will not end here.  The Joint SDG Fund will announce the results of the selection of Component 2, through the funding of catalytic investments able to mobilize financing at scale, in July 2020. This will give more countries an even greater opportunity to recover better
With sincere appreciation for the contributions from the European Union and Government of Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Kingdom of Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Private Sector funding, all continents will receive the historic opportunity to build back better.

Title: Global wake-up call -- Op-ed by UN Secretary-General
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
01 July 2020
by Antonio Guterres
[Filipino translation follows below.]
From COVID-19 to climate disruption, from racial injustice to rising inequalities, we are a world in turmoil.
At the same time, we are an international community with an enduring vision – embodied in the United Nations Charter, which marks its 75th anniversary this year. That vision of a better future —  based on the values of equality, mutual respect and international cooperation —  has helped us to avoid a Third World War that would have had catastrophic consequences for life on our planet.
Our shared challenge is to channel that collective spirit and rise to this moment of trial and test.
The pandemic has laid bare severe and systemic inequalities both within and between countries and communities.  More broadly, it has underscored the world’s fragilities – not just in the face of another health emergency, but in our faltering response to the climate crisis, lawlessness in cyberspace, and the risks of nuclear proliferation.  People everywhere are losing trust in political establishments and institutions.
The emergency is compounded by many other profound humanitarian crises: conflicts that are continuing or even intensifying; record numbers of people forced to flee their homes; swarms of locusts in Africa and South Asia; looming droughts in southern Africa and Central America; all amid a context of rising geopolitical tensions.
In the face of these fragilities, world leaders need to be humble and recognize the vital importance of unity and solidarity.
No one can predict what comes next, but I see two possible scenarios.
First, the “optimistic” possibility.
In this case, the world would muddle through.  Countries in the global North would engineer a successful exit strategy.  Developing countries would receive enough support and their demographic characteristics – namely, the youth of their people – would help contain the impact.
And then perhaps a vaccine would appear in the next nine months or so, and would be distributed as a global public good, a “people’s vaccine” available and accessible to all.
If this happens, and if the economy starts up progressively, we might move towards some kind of normality  in two or three years.
But there is also a second, bleaker scenario in which countries fail to coordinate their actions.  New waves of the virus keep occurring.  The situation in the developing world explodes.  Work on the vaccine lags — or even if there is a vaccine relatively soon —  it becomes the subject of fierce competition and countries with greater economic power gain access to it first, leaving others behind.
In this scenario, we could also see greater movement toward fragmentation, populism and xenophobia.  Each country could go it alone or in so-called coalitions of the willing to address some specific challenges.  In the end, the world would fail to mobilize the kind of governance needed to address our shared challenges.
The result may well be a global depression that could last at least five or seven years before a new normal emerges, the nature of which is impossible to predict.
It is very difficult to know if we are moving in one direction or the other.  We must work for the best and prepare for the worst.
The pandemic, as horrible as it is, must be a wake-up call that prompts all political leaders to understand that our assumptions and approaches have to change, and that division is a danger to everyone.
This understanding could lead people to recognize that the only way to address global fragilities is through much more robust mechanisms of global governance with international cooperation.
After all, we cannot simply return to the systems that gave rise to the current crisis.  We need to build back better with more sustainable, inclusive, gender-equal societies and economies.
In doing so, we must reimagine the way nations cooperate.  Today’s multilateralism lacks scale, ambition and teeth — and some of the instruments that do have teeth show little or no appetite to bite, as we have seen in the difficulties faced by the Security Council.
We need a networked multilateralism, in which the United Nations and its agencies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, regional organizations such as the African Union and European Union, trade organizations and others work together more closely and effectively.
We also need a more inclusive multilateralism.  Governments today are far from the only players in terms of politics and power.  Civil society, the business community, local authorities, cities and regional governments are assuming more and more leadership roles in today’s world.
This, in turn, will help lead to an effective multilateralism with the mechanisms it needs to make global governance work where it is needed.
A new, networked, inclusive, effective multilateralism, based on the enduring values of the United Nations Charter, could snap us out of our sleepwalking state and stop the slide towards ever greater danger.
Political leaders around the world need to heed this wake-up call and come together to address the world’s fragilities, strengthen our capacity for global governance, give teeth to multilateral institutions, and draw from the power of unity and solidarity to overcome the biggest test of our times.
Antonio Guterres is the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Panggising sa Mundo
Ni Antonio Guterres
Ang ating daigdig ay nasa gitna ng kaguluhan—magmula sa COVID-19 at pagkalansag ng klima, mula sa paglabag sa katarungan bunsod ng lahi at papatinding hindi pagkakapantay-pantay.
Sa kabilang dako, tayo ay isang pandaigdig na komunidad na may pangmatagalang pangitain—na nakapaloob sa United Nations Charter na magpipitumpu’t limang anibersaryo sa taong ito. Ang pangitain ng mas maiging hinaharap—base sa pagpapahalaga sa pagkakapantay, respeto sa isa’t isa at pagtutulungang pandaigdig—ay tumulong sa ating makaiwas sa Ikatlong Digmaang Pandaigdig na siguradong magbubunga ng kapahamakan para sa ating planeta.
Ang panlahat na hamon ay ituon ang ating pinag-isang sigla at tumindig sa sandaling ito ng paghamon at pagsubok.
Inilantad ng pandemya ang mga malubha at sistematikong di pagkakapantay sa loob at sa pagitan ng mga bansa at komunidad. Sa mas malawak na pananaw, binigyang diin ng pandemyang ito ang mga karupukan ng mundo—hindi lang sa harap ng emerhensiyang pangkalusugan kundi maging sa ating pagtugon sa krisis sa klima, kawalang ng batas sa cyberspace at sa peligro ng paglaganap ng enerhiyang nukliyar. Sa lahat ng dako ang mga tao ay nawawalan ng tiwala sa mga institusyong pampolitika.
Nagpapalala sa pandemya ang maraming krisis sa makataong pagtulong: hidwaan na patuloy o lumalala; laksang tao na napilitang lumikas sa kanilang tahanan; pagkuyog ng balang sa Africa at South Asia; paparating na tagtuyot sa southern Africa at Central America; lahat sa gitna ng tumitinding tensiyong geo-politikal.
Sa gitna ng mga karupukang ito, kailangang magpakumbaba ang mga lider ng mundo at kilalanin ang kahyalagahan ng pagkakaisa.
Walang makapagsasabi kung ano ang paparating, ngunti dalawang posibleng senaryo ang nakikita ko.
Una, ang maasahing posibilidad.
Sa kasong ito, ang mundo ay makalalampas. Makakagawa ang mga bansa sa Global North ng matagumpay na exit strategy. Makakatanggap ang mga umuunlad na bansa ng sapat na ayuda at ang kanilang katangiang demigrapiko, lalo na ang kanilang mga kabataan, ay makakapigil sa tama.
Marahil ay magkakaroon na ng bakuna sa susunod na siyam na buwan at ito ay ipamamahagi bilang pampublikong kagamitan, isang bakuna para sa tao na makukuha st matatanggap ng lahat.
Kapag nangyari ito, at ang ekonomiya ay patuloy na umandar muli, maaaring tumungo tayo sa isang uri ng normalidad sa dalawa o tatlong taon.
Ngunit mayroon ikalawa at mas nakakatakot na senaryo kung saan mabibigo ang mga bansa na pagugnayin ang kanilang pagkilos. Magpapatuloy ang mga bagong alon ng virus. Sasabog ang sitwasyon sa mga umuunlad na bansa. Babagal ang paggawa ng bakuna—at kahit na mabilis na magkakaroon ng bakuna—ito ay pagaagawan. Ang mga mayayamang bansa ay mauuna, at maiiwanan ang iba.
Sa senaryong ito, makikita din natin ang paglala ng pagkakawatak-watak, populismo at xenophobia. Ang bawat bansa ay magsasarili o makikigrupo ayon sa particular na hamon. Sa bandang huli, mabibigo ang mundo na pakilusin ang uri ng pangangasiwa na kayang tugunan ang mga hamon sa atin.
Maaaring magresulta ito sa pandaigidig na depresyon na tatagal nang lima o pitong taon bago sumulpot ang bagong normal, na imposibleng mahulaan ang katangian.
Napakahirap malaman kung tayo ay tumutungo sa isang direksiyon o sa kabila. Kailangan tayong magsumikap para sa pinakamainam at maghanda para sa pinakamalala.
Kahilahilakbot man ang pandemya, ito ay panggising na magtutulak sa mga lider political upang maintindihan na ang ating mga palagay at kinagawian ay dapat magbago, at ang pagkakawatak-watak ay mapanganib para sa lahat.
Ang pangunawang ito ay maghihimok sa mga tao na kilalanin na ang tanging paraan upang matugunan ang mga karupukan ng mundo ay ang pagtatatag ng mga matipunong pangangasiwa sa mundo sa tulong ng pandaigdig na kooperasyon.
Sa bagay, hindi tayo puwedeng bumalik sa mga kinagawian na nagbunsod sa krisis na ito. Kailangan tayong bumangon nang mas maigi, sa pamamagitan ng lipunan at ekonomiya na ingklusibo, at pantay sa mga kasarian.
Kailangan nating pagibayuhin ang pangitain ukol sa pagtutulungan ng mga bansa. Ang multilateralismo sa ngayon ay kulang sa antas, ambisyon at ngipin. Ang mga instrument na may ngipin ay walang ganang kumagat, tulad na lang ng nakikita nating kahirapan sa Security Council
Kailangan natin ng multilateralismo na naka-network, kung saan ang United Nations at mga ahensiya nito, and World Bank at International Monetary Fund, ang mga organisasyong pang-rehiyon tulad ng African Union at European Union, mga samahan ng trabaho at iba pa ay nagtutulungan nang malapitan.
Kailangan din natin ng multilateralismo na mas ingklusibo. Ang mga pamahalaan ngayon ay ilann lang sa mga actor sa politika at kapangyarihan. Patuloy na lumalaki ang papel sa mundo ng civil society, negosyo, lokal na awtoridad at pamahalaan sa rehiyon.
Sa pamamagitan nito, susulpot ang multilateralism na mas epektibo at may mga mekanismo na magpapaandar ng pandaigdig na pangangasiwa ng mundo.
Isang bago, naka-network, ingklusibo at epektibong multilateralismo, na nakabatay sa pinahahlagahan ng United Nations Charter, ang gigising sa atin mula sa pagkatulog at hihimpil sa pagdausdos natin sa mas malalang panganib.
Kailangang pakinggan ng mga lider sa mundo ang paggising na ito at magkaisa upang matugunan ang mga karupukan ng mundo, palakasin ang ating kakayahang pangasiwaan ang daigdig, bigyan ng ngipin ang mga institusyong multilateral, at humugot ng lakas sa pagkakaisa at pagtutulungan upang mapagtagumpayan ang hamon ng ating panahon.

Title: 86-M kids worldwide ravaged by pandemic — UNICEF and Save the Children
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
30 June 2020
Up to 86 million more children will be pushed into poverty in low and middle-income countries, including the Philippines, as parents and guardians lose their jobs and sources of income due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This was reflected in a joint analysis conducted by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Save the Children which showed that the number of children living in poor households across developing and emerging countries could increase by 15%, and estimated to reach 672 million by the end of 2020.
In a statement on 29 June 2020, both the UNICEF and Save the Children warned that the immediate loss of income means families are less able to afford the basics, including food and water, less likely to access health care or education, and more at risk of child marriage, violence, exploitation and abuse.
Save the Children International CEO Inger Ashing said the shocking poverty impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will hit children hard, adding that “children are highly vulnerable to even short periods of hunger and malnutrition—potentially affecting them for their whole life.”
“If we act now and decisively, we can prevent and contain the COVID-19 pandemic threat. This report should be a wake-up call for the world. Poverty is not inevitable for children,” Ashing said.
For her part, UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said the scale and depth of financial hardship among families threatens to roll back years of progress in reducing child poverty and to leave children deprived of essential services.
“Without concerted action, families barely getting by could be pushed into poverty, and the poorest families could face levels of deprivation that have not been seen for decades,” she said.
They also cited in the analysis that the poorest families have high exposure to COVID-19 due to their lack of access to social care services or compensatory measures that further limits their ability to abide by containment and infection mitigation measures such as physical distancing.
Meanwhile, lawyer Alberto Muyot, CEO of Save the Children-Philippines, said children experience poverty differently compared to adults as it impacts their health and survival, learning and development due to neglect, and exposure to risks including hazardous work and being lured to sexual abuse and exploitation.
“Poverty for children means enduring pain, stigma, shame, and loss of self-esteem thereby attracting ridicule or insult and causing deep psychological impact to young minds,” Muyot said.
In 2017, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) already identified that children belong to the poorest basic sector, next to farmers and fisherfolk.
In a separate study by the World Bank showed that most of the children who are undernourished belong to farming and fishing communities. While poverty incidence for children is at 31.4 percent at the national level, it said, “poverty is even worse in the conflict-affected provinces of Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) at 63 percent.”
Furthermore, the pandemic’s impact is worse among children whose families rely on the informal economy but could not recover since the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) like the public utility drivers, vendors, etc.
The impact of the pandemic would likewise take a heavy toll on children of the 300,000 displaced overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) as well as of the 5 to 10 million workers at home who stand to lose jobs by the end of 2020, as reported by the government.

Title: Philippines: UN human rights experts renew call for an on-the-ground independent, impartial investigation
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
25 June 2020
UN human rights experts call on the Government of the Philippines to demonstrate real and credible progress toward accountability by engaging with the OHCHR and developing an action plan towards the implementation of the OHCHR Report recommendations
GENEVA (25 June 2020) – One year ago, 11 UN human rights experts jointly called on the Human Rights Council to establish an independent investigation into human rights violations in the Philippines. The Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 41/2 which requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a comprehensive written report on the situation of human rights in the Philippines and to present it at its 44th session.
“The report, issued on 4 June 2020, confirmed our findings and warnings issued over the last four years: widespread and systematic killings and arbitrary detention in the context of the war on drugs, killings and abuses targeting farmers and indigenous peoples, the silencing of independent media, critics and the opposition. The report recognises important efforts to improve the protection of economic and social rights and stresses that these efforts should be guided by a human rights-based approach and focused on “leaving no one behind”. The reports also finds, as we had, stark and persistent impunity,” UN experts said today.
“Given the scale and seriousness of the human rights violations, we renew our call on the Human Rights Council to establish an on-the-ground independent, impartial investigation into human rights violations in the Philippines.”
The experts highlighted “the staggering cost of the relentless and systematic assault on the most basic rights of Filipinos at the hands of the Government”:
“COVID-19 has further accelerated the downward spiral of the human rights situation in the Philippines. Police and the military have used violence and lethal force to enforce a quarantine imposed without due consideration for the situation of the poorest and most vulnerable communities,” the experts said. “In response to the protests of poor Filippinos demanding food aid amid the COVID-19 lockdown, President Duterte reportedly authorized police and security forces to kill protesters saying: ‘Do you understand? Dead. Instead of causing trouble, I’ll send you to the grave’.”
The report issued by the OHCHR has found many examples of such rhetoric and concluded that it could amount to incitement to violence and may be in violation of the ICCPR’s prohibition on arbitrary deprivation of life.
The experts warned that the Philippine Government’s attempt to fast track a new Anti-Terrorism Bill will further dilute human rights safeguards, by justifying the arrests of human rights defenders and government’s critics, authorising lengthy detention based on warrantless arrests, wiretapping and other surveillance for extended periods of time.
“Thousands in the Philippines have been killed as the direct result of the government policies. Domestic mechanisms responsible for ensuring accountability and protecting the rule of law have failed to do so,” the UN experts said.
“The response of the international community must set an example. The OHCHR report should not be the end of international commitment but a milestone marking the beginning of real accountability, redress for the victims and a definite end to the very serious violations committed.
“The human rights situation in the Philippines has now reached a level of gravity requiring a robust intervention by the UN. The Human Rights Council must do everything in its power to prevent the continuation of widespread and systematic human rights abuses against the Philippines people.”
The experts urged the Human Rights Council to:
“We call on the Government of the Philippines to demonstrate real and credible progress toward accountability by engaging with the OHCHR and developing an action plan towards the implementation of the OHCHR Report recommendations. We stand ready to provide technical assistance and advice to the Government and the OHCHR.
“We call on Member States to initiate, whenever possible, governmental sanctions and criminal prosecution against individual Philippine officials who have committed, incited or failed to prevent human rights abuses.”

Title: Secretary-General's remarks at the launch of the UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
25 June 2020
[Video coverage of the launch of the UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19 on 25 June 2020 is available here]
[Filipino translation of these remarks is found below]
We mark tomorrow’s 75th anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Charter at a time of colossal global upheaval and risk.
From COVID-19 to climate disruption, from racial injustice to rising inequalities, we are a world in turmoil.
At the same time, we are an international community with an enduring vision – embodied in the Charter – to guide us to a better future.
The same Charter whose values enabled us to avoid the scourge of a Third World War as many had feared.
Our shared challenge is to rise to this moment.
Let me start with COVID-19.
A microscopic virus has brought catastrophic consequences to our world.
The pandemic has laid bare severe and systemic inequalities.
And it has underscored the world’s fragilities more generally – not just in the face of another health emergency but also the climate crisis, lawlessness in cyberspace, and the risks of nuclear proliferation again.
People are losing ever more trust in political establishments and institutions.
In the face of these fragilities, world leaders need to be humble and to recognize the vital importance of unity and solidarity.
None of us can predict what comes next.
We are in the middle of the mist.
Where we can, the United Nations has cut through the fog – and acted.
The United Nations family has mobilized to save lives, control transmission of the virus and ease the economic fallout.
We have shipped more than 250 million items of personal protective equipment to more than 130 countries; ensured education for 155 million children; and provided mental health support for 45 million children, parents and caregivers.
We placed the UN supply chain network at the service of Member States and established 8 global air hubs that have reached more than 110 countries, providing 69,000 cubic meters of medical goods in the last six weeks alone.
We have trained nearly 2 million health and community workers…
Created safe channels for 3 million children and adults to report sexual exploitation and abuse …
And reached more than 2 billion people with information on staying safe and accessing health services.
From the beginning, the United Nations has been calling for massive global support for the most vulnerable people and countries – a rescue package amounting to at least 10 per cent of the global economy and promoting the mechanisms of solidarity to ensure that the developing world can also benefit from it.
The United Nations is supporting work to accelerate research and development for a people’s vaccine, affordable and accessible to all. A global public good.
My appeal for a global ceasefire has been endorsed by nearly 180 countries, more than 20 armed groups, as well as religious leaders and millions of members of civil society.
The difficulty is to implement it.
My Special Envoys and I are working together to establish effective ceasefires and doing everything possible to overcome the legacy of long-lasting conflicts with deep mistrust among the parties and spoilers with a vested interest in disruption.
We are also fighting the plague of misinformation.  Next Tuesday, June 30th, our new “Verified” initiative will ask people using social media platforms to participate in a special global “pause” before sharing questionable information.
Today, I am presenting an overview of our comprehensive United Nations Response on COVID-19 – documenting not only our action over the last three months, but also offering a roadmap toward recovering better.
We cannot go back to the way it was and simply recreate the systems that have aggravated the crisis.
We need to build back better with more sustainable, inclusive, gender-equal societies and economies.
There is no good reason, for example, for any country to include coal in their COVID-19 recovery plans.  This is the time to invest in energy sources that don’t pollute, don’t cause emissions, generate decent jobs and save money.
The United Nations is strongly committed to leading the renewal.
For 75 years, we have sought to help stitch the world together in productive cooperative relationships for global problem-solving and the common good.
Today, we are pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, providing food assistance for 87 million people in 83 countries and vaccines for half the world’s children, helping to save 3 million lives every year.
And women and men of the United Nations are assisting 80 million refugees and displaced people and enabling more than 2 million women and girls to overcome complications from pregnancy and childbirth.
Forty political missions and peacekeeping operations, with 95,000 troops, police and civilian personnel, strive to keep the peace and to protect civilians.  Our electoral assistance now extends to 60 countries each year.
And our help for victims of torture reaches 40,000 people.  And some 7,500 monitoring missions every year seek to protect human rights, make violations known and hold perpetrators accountable.
This is the work of the United Nations, day in and day out, around the clock, around the world.
Throughout this anniversary year, we have also been listening.
For that, we mobilized more than 5,000 partners and convened more than 1,000 listening sessions in 124 countries.
More than 230,000 people in 193 Member States and observer states engaged in our forward-looking UN75 survey.
The responses paint a clear picture of priorities in the time of COVID-19 and beyond:
Number one: universal access to healthcare.
Number two: strengthen solidarity between people and nations.
Number three: rethink the global economy against inequality.
As we mark Charter Day and look ahead, we must reimagine the way nations cooperate.
We need a networked multilateralism, bringing together the UN system, regional organizations, international financial institutions and others.
And we need an inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the indispensable contributions of civil society, business, cities, regions and, in particular, with greater weight given to the voices of youth.
In the 21st century, Governments are no longer the only political and power reality.
And we need an effective multilateralism that can function as an instrument of global governance where it is needed.
The problem is not that multilateralism is not up to the challenges the world faces.  The problem is that today’s multilateralism lacks scale, ambition and teeth.
And some of the instruments that do have teeth, show little or no appetite to bite, as has recently been the case with the difficulties faced by the Security Council.
We need to give multilateralism the capacities to confront our challenges, not only to meet immediate needs, but to enable future generations to meet theirs.
In an ever more interdependent world, national interests are not easily separated from the global good.
Shared values, shared responsibility, shared sovereignty, shared progress – these must be our guide and our goals.
I understand the challenge.
It is difficult to have a meaningful transformation of the mechanisms of global governance without the active participation of the world powers – and, let me blunt, their relationships today have never been more dysfunctional.
But I firmly believe that an awakening will come when we recognize our shared fragilities – when the factors that today divide instead begin to force people to finally understand that division is a danger to everyone, starting with themselves.
Ultimately, that is the way out of the mist.
Our Charter still points that way.
I draw encouragement from much that the United Nations has helped make possible across the decades, and from the heroism of so much of the COVID-19 response. This is solidarity and unity to build on.
I look forward to discussing these matters with world leaders in September in whatever format necessary. We absolutely must come together to reimagine and reinvent the world we share.
Thank you.

Pahayag ng Secretary-General sa paglulunsad ng UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19
Ipagdiriwang natin bukas ang ika-75 anibersaryo ng pagpapatibay ng United Nations Charter sa panahon ng napakalaking kaguluhang pandaigdig.
Nariyan ang COVID-19 at pagkagiba ng klima, kaapihang kaakibat ng lahi at papataas na di pagkakapantay-pantay. Tayo ay daigdig ng kaguluhan.
Ngunit tayo rin ay isang pandaigdig na kumunidad na may pananaw na di nagmamaliw—kinakatawan sa Charter—na maggagabay sa atin patungo sa mas mainam na hinaharap.
Ang parehong Charter na kumakatawan sa mga prinsipyo at paniniwala na naglihis sa atin sa Pangatlong Giyerang Pandaigdig na ating kinatatakutan.
Ang hamon sa atin ay tindigan ang sandaling ito.
Hayaan ninyong mag-umpisa ako sa COVID-19.
Isang pagkaliit na virus na nagpabagsak sa ating daigdig.
inilantad ng pandemya ang mga matindi at sistematikong di-pagkakapantaypantay.
Bingiyang-diin nito ang mga kahinaan ng mundo, hindi lang sa pagharap sa crisis pangkalusugan kundi kasabay ang krisis sa klima, kaguluhan sa cyberspace, at pinagibayong panganib mula sa nuclear proliferation.
Lalong nawawalan ng tiwala ang mga tao sa mga institusyon ang establisamentong pampulitika.
Sa harap ng mga kahinaang ito, kailangang magpakumbaba ang mga lider ng bansa at kilalanin ang kahalagahan ng pahkakaisa at solidaridad.
Ni isa sa atin ang nakakaalam kung ano ang susunod na mangyayari.
Tayo ay pinalilibutan ng dagim.
Sa aming makakayayanan, hinawi ng United Nations ang dagim—at umaksiyon.
Ang pamilya ng United Nations ay kumilos upang sagipin ang mga buhay, piggilan ang pagkalat ng virus at bawasan ang pagtama sa ekonomiya.
Nakapagpadala kami ng higit sa 250 milyong personal protective equipment sa lampas sa 130 bansa; siniguro ang edukasyon para sa 150 milyong mga bata; at nagbigay ng kalingang pangkaisipansa 45 milyong kabataan, magulang, at tagapag-alaga.
Inihandog naming ang supply chain network ng UN upang makatulong sa mga Miyembrong Bansa at nagtayo ng 8 pandaigdig na air hub na nakaaabot sa higit sa 110 bansa, at nakapagpapadala ng 69000 metro kubiko ng produktong medical sa nakalipas na anim na lingo lamang.
Nakapagsanay kami ng halos 2 milyong manggagawang pangkalusugan at pangkomunidad...
Lumikha ng ligtas na paraang upang makapagsumbong ang 3 milyong bata at nakatatanda na biktima ng pangaabusong seksuwal...
At nakapagpaabot sa higit sa 2 bilyong katao ng impormasyon upang sila ay maging ligtas at makatanggap ng serbisyong pangkalusugan.
Mula pa noong umpisa, nanawagan ang United Nations para sa ayuda sa pinaka-bulnerableng mga tao at bansa—isang paketeng pangsagip na nagkakahalaga ng di kukulangin sa 10 porsiyento ng pandaigidig na ekonomiya upang masiguro na ang mga umuunlad na bansa ay makinabang.
Ang United Nations ay tumutulong sa pagpapabilis ng pananaliksik at paglinang ng bakuna para sa lahat, sa presyong abot-kaya ng lahat.
Ang aking apela para sa pandaigdig na tigil-putukan ay sinigundahan ng halos 180 na bansa, higit sa 20 grupong armado, at mga lider relihiyoso at milyon-milyong miyembro ng civil society.
Ang mahirap gawin ay ipatupad ito.
Ako at ang aking mga Special Envoy ay nagpapagal upang maitatag ang epektibong tigil-putukan at ginagawa ang lahat upang magapi ang minanang mga hidwaan.
Nilalabanan din naming ang salot ng maling impormasyon. Sa susunod na Martes, ika-30 ng Hunyo, ang aming bagong inisyatibo na tinatawag na “Verified” ay hihimok sa mga gumagamit ng social media sa buong mundo na tumigil sandal bago magbahagi ng kahinahinalang impormasyon.
Sa araw na ito, ihahayag ko ang isang komprehensibong pananaw sa pagtugon ng United Nations sa COVID-19—hindi lamang ang nagawa na namin sa nakalipas na tatlong buwan kundi ang mapa na aming inihahandog upang tayo ay makabangon nang maigi.
Hindi tayo dapat bumalik sa dati at pag-ibayuhin ang mga sistema na nagpalala sa krisis.
Dapat tayong bumangon nang mas maigi kaakibat ang mga ekonomiyha na mas sustenable, pantay sa lahat ng kasarian, at ingklusibo.
Bilang halimbawa, walang dahilan para sa anumang bansa na isama ang carbon sa kanilang planong pagbangon sa COVID-19. Ito ang panahon upang mamuhunan sa mga bukal ng enerhiya na di marumi, nagbubuga ng emission at lumilikha ng mga disenteng trabaho at nakapagtitipiud ng pera.
Tapat ang United Nations sa pagsulong sa pagbabagong ito.
Sa nakalipas na 75 taon, kiami ay nagpagal upang buoin ang mundo muli sa pamamagitan ng pagtutulungan sa paghahanap ng solusyon sa pandaigdig na suliranin at para sa kabutihan ng lahat.
Ngayon, nagsusumikap kaming abutin ang Sustainable Development Goals, upang mabigyan ng tulong-=pagkain ang 87 milyong tao sa 83 bansa at bakuna para sa kalahati ng kabataan sa mundo, at sagipin ang 3 milyong tao bawat taon.
And women and men of the United Nations are assisting 80 million refugees and displaced people and enabling more than 2 million women and girls to overcome complications from pregnancy and childbirth.
Tinutulungan namin ang 80 milyong refugee at mga lumikas sa tahanan, at ang 2 milyong kababaihan na makaiwas sa kumplikasyon sa pagbubuntis at panganganak.
Apatnapung misyon na pampulitika at peacekeeping, na may kaakibat na 95,000 tropa, pulis at sibilyang tauhan, ang nagpapanatili ng kaayusan at nagangalaga sa mga sibilyan. Ang aming tulong sa pagboboto ay umabot na sa 60 bansa bawat taon.
At ang aming ayuda sa mga biktima ng tortyur ay nakaabot na sa 40,000 tao. Bawat taon, kulang-kulang sa 7500 misyong pampayo ay nangangalaga sa karapatang pantao, naghahayag ng mga paglabag at nagpapanagot sa mga may-sala.
Ito ang gawain ng United Nations, araw-araw, bawat oras, at sa lahat ng sulok ng mundo.
Sa kabuuan ng taon ng anibersaryo, kami rin ay makikinig.
Nagpagalaw kami ng 5,000 kabakas at nagtipon ng mga sesyon upang making sa 124 bansa.
Higit sa 230,000 tao sa aming 193 Miyembrong Bansa ang nakilahok sa UN75 survey.
Ang kanilang mga tugon ay nagpapakita kung alin ang mga prayoridad sa panahon ng COVID-19 at sa hinaharap:
Una, pangangalagang pangkalusugan para sa lahat.
Ikalawa, pagtutulungan ng mga tao at bansa.
Ikatlo, pagbabago sa ekonomiyang pandaigidig upang wakasan ang di-pagkakapantaypantay.
Habang pinasisinayaan natin ang Charter Day at ang susunod pang panahon, kailangan nating baguhin kung paano tayo makikipagtulungan sa isa’t isa.
Kailangan natin ng multilateralismo na magkakakabit, na pinagsama ang sistema ng UN, mga samahan sa rehiyon, pandaigdig na institusyon ng pananalapi, at iba pa.
Kailangan natin ng multilateralismo na ingklusibo, umaasa sa ambag ng civil society, negosyo, mga siyudad, rehiyon, at binibigyan nang higi9t na bigat ang tinig ng kabataan.
Sa siglo beinte-uno, hindi na lamang ang pamahalaan ang nagtataglay ng lakas.
Kailangan natin ng epektibong multilateralismo na kayang magsilbi sa pandaigdig na pangangasiwa kung kinakailangan.
Ang problema ay hindi multilateralismo mismo, kundi ang multilateralismo sa panahon natin na kulang sa lawak, ambisyon at ngipin,
Ang mga instrumentong may ngipin naman ay di ibig kumagat, tulad na lang nga mga suliraning hinaharap ng Security Council.
Kailangan natin ang multilateralismo na may kakayahang harapin ang mga hamon, imbes na ang pananadaliang pangangailangan lamang, upang tulungan ang mga susunod na henerasyon na harapin ang hamon sa kanila.
Sa lalong pinagdugtong na daigdig, hindi madaling paghiwalayin ang Pambansa sa pandaigdig na interes.
Pinag-isang pinahahalagahan, pinag-isang responsibilidad, pinag-isang soberanidad, pinag-isang pag-unlad—ito ang dapat gumabay sa atin.
Alam kong malaki ang hamon.
Hindi madaling baguhin ang mga mekanismo ng pandaigdig na pangangasiwa kung wala ang aktibong pakikilahok ng mga makapangyarihang bansa. Sa panahong ito, ang kanilang pakikitungo sa isa’t isa ay walang tulad ang kaguluhan.
Subalit naniniwala ako na darating ang pagkamulat kung saan kikilalanin natin ang ating pinag-isang kahinaan—kung saan ang mga bagay na naghihiwalay sa atin ay makikilala natin bilang banta sa lahat.
Yaon ang daan palabas ng dagim.
Ang Charter ang magtuturo sa daan.
Nabubuhayan ako ng loob dahil sa lahat ng nagawa na ng United Nations sa nakalipas na mga dekada, at sa katapangan ng loob na makikita sa pagtugon sa COVID-19. Sa pagkakaisa at solidaridad tayo mag-uumpisa.
Hihintayin ko ang pagkakataon na mapag-usapan ang mga bagay na ito kasama ng mga lider ng bansa sa Setyembre. Lubos na kailangan nating baguhin ang imahen ng ating pinag-isang mundo.
Salamat po.

Title: COVID-19 may push millions more children into child labour – ILO and UNICEF
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
19 June 2020
NEW YORK/GENEVA, 12 June 2020 – Millions more children risk being pushed into child labour as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, which could lead to the first rise in child labour after 20 years of progress, according to a new brief from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF.
According to COVID-19 and child labour: A time of crisis, a time to act, child labour decreased by 94 million since 2000, but that gain is now at risk.
Children already in child labour may be working longer hours or under worsening conditions, the report says. More of them may be forced into the worst forms of labour, which causes significant harm to their health and safety.
“As the pandemic wreaks havoc on family incomes, without support, many could resort to child labour,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder. “Social protection is vital in times of crisis, as it provides assistance to those who are most vulnerable. Integrating child labour concerns across broader policies for education, social protection, justice, labour markets, and international human and labour rights makes a critical difference.”
According to the brief, COVID-19 could result in a rise in poverty and therefore to an increase in child labour as households use every available means to survive. Some studies show that a one percentage point rise in poverty leads to at least a 0.7 per cent increase in child labour in certain countries.
“In times of crisis, child labour becomes a coping mechanism for many families,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “As poverty rises, schools close and the availability of social services decreases, more children are pushed into the workforce. As we reimagine the world post-COVID, we need to make sure that children and their families have the tools they need to weather similar storms in the future. Quality education, social protection services and better economic opportunities can be game changers.”
Vulnerable population groups – such as those working in the informal economy and migrant workers – will suffer most from economic downturn, increased informality and unemployment, the general fall in living standards, health shocks and insufficient social protection systems, among other pressures.
Evidence is gradually mounting that child labour is rising as schools close during the pandemic. Temporary school closures are currently affecting more than 1 billion learners in over 130 countries. Even when classes restart, some parents may no longer be able to afford to send their children to school.
As a result, more children could be forced into exploitative and hazardous jobs. Gender inequalities may grow more acute, with girls particularly vulnerable to exploitation in agriculture and domestic work, the brief says.
The brief proposes a number of measures to counter the threat of increased child labour, including more comprehensive social protection, easier access to credit for poor households, the promotion of decent work for adults, measures to get children back into school, including the elimination of school fees, and more resources for labour inspections and law enforcement.
ILO and UNICEF are developing a simulation model to look at the impact of COVID-19 on child labour globally. New global estimates on child labour will be released in 2021.

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks at the launch of the Policy Brief on COVID-19 and the World of Work
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
19 June 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the world of work upside down.
Every worker, every business and every corner of the globe has been affected.
Hundreds of millions of jobs have been lost.
Those toiling in the informal economy — often without rights at work and social protection — are projected to have suffered a 60 percent decline in earnings in the first month of the crisis alone.
Women have been especially hard hit — working in many of the most critically affected sectors, while also carrying the greatest burden of increasing levels of unpaid care work.
Young people, persons with disabilities, and so many others are facing tremendous difficulties.
Many small and medium-sized enterprises – the engine of the global economy – may not survive.
This crisis in the world of work is adding fuel to an already burning fire of discontent and anxiety.
Massive unemployment and loss of income from COVID-19 are further eroding social cohesion and destabilizing countries and regions— socially, politically and economically.
Yes, many companies and workers have adapted in innovative ways to the changing circumstances.  For example, millions have moved overnight to working online, in many cases with surprising success.
But the most vulnerable are at risk of becoming ever more vulnerable, and poor countries and communities risk falling even further behind.
We need action on three fronts:
First, immediate support for at-risk workers, enterprises, jobs and incomes to avoid closures, job losses and income decline.
Second, greater focus on both health and economic activity after lockdowns ease, with workplaces that are safe, and rights for women and populations at risk.
Third, we need to mobilize now for a human-centred, green and sustainable, inclusive recovery that harnesses the potential of new technologies to create decent jobs for all — and draws on the creative and positive ways companies and workers have adapted to these times.
There is a lot of talk about the need for a “new normal” after this crisis.
But let’s not forget that the pre-COVID-19 world was far from normal.
Rising inequalities, systemic gender discrimination, lack of opportunities for young people, stagnant wages, runaway climate change — none of these things were “normal”.
The pandemic exposed tremendous shortcomings, fragilities and fault lines.
The world of work cannot and should not look the same after this crisis.
It is time for a coordinated global, regional and national effort to create decent work for all as the foundation of a green, inclusive and resilient recovery.  For example, a shift of taxation from payroll to carbon could help to go a long way in this direction.
With smart and timely action at all levels, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as our guide, we can emerge from this crisis stronger, with better jobs and a brighter, more equal and greener future for all.

Title: UN Secretary-General calls on countries to expand digital cooperation
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
12 June 2020
NEW YORK, 11 June 2020--United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres presented today a set of recommended actions for the international community to help ensure all people are connected, respected, and protected in the digital age. The Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation is the result of a multi-year, multi-stakeholder, global effort to address a range of issues related to the Internet, artificial intelligence, and other digital technologies.
The Roadmap for Digital Cooperation comes at a critical inflection point for digital issues, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating digitization and magnifying both opportunities and challenges of digital technology.
The benefits of digital technology highlighted by the pandemic—such as collaborative vaccine research, remote work and learning, and e-commerce—also reflect a growing divide between people who are connected and those who are not. Nearly half of the global population, 46.4 percent according to the International Telecommunication Union, cannot connect to the internet and remain unable to fully participate in the digital age. Women are disproportionately affected with only 48% connected globally. Meanwhile, as efforts to connect more people proceed, new vulnerabilities have arisen. Cyberattacks and misinformation threaten human rights, privacy, and security.
The rapid speed of adoption of digital technology has outpaced policy and governance at the national, regional, and global levels. The Secretary-General’s newly announced Roadmap seeks to address these challenges by recommending concrete action to harness the best of these technologies and mitigate their risks.
“To fully reap its benefits and contain potential harms we must ensure the digital age is defined by increased international cooperation,” said António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations.
“There are no borders in cyberspace. Today I call on all UN member states and our partners in industry and civil society to expand cooperation on digital technology issues. Only by working together can we connect all people by 2030, respect human rights online, and protect the most vulnerable from the potential perils of the digital age.”
To meet the call to connect, respect, and protect the online world, the action-oriented Roadmap presents the Secretary-General’s recommendations for concrete action by diverse stakeholders that would enhance global digital cooperation in the following areas:
The Secretary-General’s Roadmap builds on recommendations made by the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, and input from Member States, the private sector, civil society, the technical community and other stakeholder groups. The High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation, co-chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma, represented an unprecedented mix of disciplines and sectors as well as geographic, gender and age diversity. The Panel’s report, submitted in June 2019, was followed up with extensive multi-stakeholder outreach and consultations to provide input and help shape the Roadmap.

Title: Secretary-General's remarks at the launch of the Policy Brief on the Impact of COVID-19 on Food Security and Nutrition
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
09 June 2020
Download the Policy Brief here
Filipino translation below
There is more than enough food in the world to feed our population of 7.8 billion people.
But, today, more than 820 million people are hungry.
And some 144 million children under the age of 5 are stunted – more than one in five children worldwide.
Our food systems are failing, and the Covid-19 pandemic is making things worse.
Unless immediate action is taken, it is increasingly clear that there is an impending global food emergencythat could have long term impacts on hundreds of millions of children and adults.
This year, some 49 million extra people may fall into extreme poverty due to the COVID-19 crisis.
The number of people who are acutely food or nutrition insecure will rapidly expand.
Every percentage point drop in global Gross Domestic Product means an additional 0.7 million stunted children.
Even in countries with abundant food, we see risks of disruptions in the food supply chain.
We need to act now to avoid the worst impacts of our efforts to control the pandemic.
Today I am launching a Policy Brief on the Impact of COVID-19 on Food Security and Nutrition.
It has three clear findings.
First, we must mobilize to save lives and livelihoods, focusing attention where the risk is most acute.
That means designating food and nutrition services as essential, while implementing appropriate protections for food workers.
It means preserving critical humanitarian food, livelihood and nutrition assistance to vulnerable groups.
And it means positioning food in food-crisis countries to reinforce and scale up social protection systems.
Countries need to scale up support for food processing, transport and local food markets, and they must keep trade corridors open to ensure the continuous functioning of food systems.
And they must ensure that relief and stimulus packages reach the most vulnerable, including meeting the liquidity needs of small-scale food producers and rural businesses.
Second, we must strengthen social protection systems for nutrition.
Countries need to safeguard access to safe, nutritious foods, particularly for young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, older people and other at-risk groups.
And they need to adapt and expand social protection schemes to benefit nutritionally at-risk groups.
This includes supporting children who no longer have access to school meals.
Third, we must invest in the future.
We have an opportunity to build a more inclusive and sustainable world.
Let us build food systems that better address the needs of food producers and workers.
Let us provide more inclusive access to healthy and nutritious food so we can eradicate hunger.
And let us rebalance the relationship between food systems and the natural environment by transforming them to work better with nature and for the climate.
We cannot forget that food systems contribute up to 29 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, including 44 per cent of methane, and are having a negative impact on biodiversity.
If we do these things and more, as indicated by the brief we are launching today, we can avoid some of the worst impacts of the COVID19 pandemic on food security and nutrition – and we can do so in a way that supports the green transition that we need to make.
Thank you.
Filipino translation as follows:
Mayroong sapat na pagkain sa mundo para sa ating populasyon na 7.8 bilyon.
Subali’t ngayon, higit sa 820 milyong katao ang nagugutom.
Mahigit kumulang 144 milyong kabataan, o isa sa bawat limang bata, na wala pang limang taong gulang ay maliit para sa kanilang edad.
Ang ating mga sistema para sa pagkain ay lumalagapak, at pinalalala pa ito ng COVID-19.
Kung hindi tayo kagyat na aaksiyon, hindi malayong magkaroon tayo ng pandaigdigang emerhensiya sa pagkain na tatama sa laksa-laksang bata at matanda.
Ngayong taon, kulang-kulang sa 49 milyong tao ang madaragdag sa bilang ng mga taong ubod nang hirap dahil sa krisis na dulot ng COVID-19.
Ang bilang ng mga taong matindi ang kakulangan sa pagkain ay mabilis na lolobo.
Bawat punto-porsiyentong pagbaba ng Gross Domestic Product ay nangangahulugan na 0.7 milyong bata ay maliit para sa kanilang edad.
Kahit pa sa mga bansang sagana sa pagkain, nakakakita tayo ng pagkaputol sa kanilang food supply chain.
Kailangan tayong umaksyon ngayon na upang masawata ang pinakamalubhang pagtama ng ating risponde sa pandemya.
Sa araw na ito, aking inilalathala ang Policy Brief ukol sa epekto ng COVID-19 sa seguridad sa pagkain at sa nutrisyon.
Mayroon itong tatlong punto.
Una, kailangan tayong kumilos upang masagip ang mga buhay at kabuhayan, na may partikular na pagtuon kung saan ang banta ay pinakamatindi.
Ibig sabihin, kailangan nating italaga bilang esensyal ang mga serbisyo ukol sa pagkain at nutrisyon, habang pinangangalagaan ang ating mga trabahador sa industriya ng pagkain.
Ibig sabihin, kailangan nating panatilihin ang makataong paglalaan ng pagkain, hanapbuhay at ayudang pang-nutrisyong sa mga grupong hight na bulnerable.
Ibig sabihin, kailangan nating magtalaga ng pagkain para sa mga bansang nakakaranas ng krisis sa pagkain upang paigtingin at palakasin ang kanilang social protectiion systems.
Kailangan palawakin ng mga bansa ang kanilang suporta sa pag-proseso ng pagkain, paghahatid nito, at sa mga lokal na merkado ng pagkain, at dapat na pantiliin nila ang daanan ng pagkain upang masiguro ang patuloy na paggalaw ng mga sistemang ukol sa pagkain.
At kailangan nilang siguraduhin na ang mga pakete ng ayuda at pagbangon ay nakaaabto sa pinaka-bulnerable, kasama na rito ang mga pangangailan sa pondo ng mga maliliit na negosyo sa kanayunan at maliliit na taga-proseso ng pagkain.
Ikalawa, kailangan nating palakasin ang ating mga social protection system para sa nutrisyon.
Kailangang pangalagaan ng mga bansa ang kakayahang bumili ng ligtas at masustansyang pagkain para sa mga maliliit na bata, mga buntis at nagpapagatas na kababaihan, mga nakatatanda at iba pang grupong nasa peligro.
At kailangan nilang i-ayon at palawakin ang social protection upang makinabang ang mga namimiligro ukol sa nutrisyon.
Kasali dito ang pag-ayuda sa mga batang di na nakatatanggap ng pagkain sa eskuwela.
Ikatlo, kailangan tayong mamuhunan sa hinaharap.
Mayroon tayong pagkakataon na humubog ng isang inkusibo at sustenableng mundo.
Bumuo tayo ng mga sistemang pang-pagkain na mas maiging makatutugon sa pangangailangan ng mga manggawa sa industriya ng pagkain.
Gumawa tayo ng mas inklusibong paraan ng pamamahagi ng nakapagpapalusog na pagkain upang mawakasan ang pagkagutom.
Ating balansehin ang relasyon sa pagitan ng sistemang pang-pagkain at ng ating kalikasan upang maging mas maigi para sa kalikasan at klima.
Huwag nating kalimutan na ang ating sistemang pang-pagkain ay nagdudulot ng 29 porsiyento ng greenhouse has emissions, kasama na rito ang 44 porsiyento ng methane, na sumisira sa ating biodiversity.
Kung ang lahat nang ito ay magagawa natin, tulad ng nakasaad sa policy brief na inilalathala ko ngayon, maiiwasan natin ang pinakamalubhang epekto ng pandemyang COVID-19 sa ating seguridad sa pagkain at nutrisyon. Magagawa natin ito sa paraan na nakaayon sa green transition na inaasam natin.
Salamat po.

Title: UNDP supports BARMM connectivity amid COVID-19 through teleconferencing access
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
05 June 2020
BARMM – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the Philippines provided 43 ZOOM teleconferencing licenses to the Bangsamoro government in an effort to support the BARMM's capacity to continuously operate and reach its partners amid COVID-19.
Among the recipients of the 43 accounts are the Office of the Chief Minister Ahod Ibrahim, all the 15 ministries and select LGUs under the MILG in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).
With the community quarantine in BARMM provinces in response to the nationwide efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines, the BARMM government can capitalize on virtual meeting and teleconferencing technology in reaching out to its constituencies and partners, especially given the geographic and infrastructure challenges in the region.
BARMM officials have acknowledged the utility of these accounts in helping them engage with the “new normal” and in being able to continue core governance functions even during a crisis.
The said accounts were activated a week after the presentation of the contingency plan by Chief Minister Ahod Ibrahim and the rest of the ministries to partners all over the Philippines.
Aside from providing the accounts, UNDP Philippines will also capacitate the technical staff of the BARMM ministries in operating ZOOM and in using the platform securely.
Despite the lifting of the enhanced community quarantine in the region, the BARMM government is still pushing for the strengthening of its IT infrastructure and developing digital capabilities not only to swiftly adapt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to prepare the region for the “new normal.”

Title: Philippines: UN report details widespread human rights violations and persistent impunity
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
04 June 2020
BANGKOK/GENEVA (4 June 2020) – A heavy-handed focus on countering national security threats and illegal drugs has resulted in serious human rights violations in the Philippines, including killings and arbitrary detentions, as well as the vilification of dissent, a new report by the UN Human Rights Office said Thursday. Persistent impunity and formidable barriers to accessing justice need to be urgently addressed, the report said.
The report, which was mandated by a UN Human Rights Council resolution, noted that many of the human rights concerns it has documented are long-standing, but have become more acute in recent years. This has been manifested particularly starkly in the widespread and systematic killing of thousands of alleged drug suspects. Numerous human rights defenders have also been killed over the past five years.
“While there have been important human rights gains in recent years, particularly in economic and social rights, the underpinning focus on national security threats – real and inflated – has led to serious human rights violations, reinforced by harmful rhetoric from high-level officials,” the report stated. “This focus has permeated the implementation of existing laws and policies and the adoption of new measures – often at the expense of human rights, due process rights, the rule of law, and accountability.”
Since the Government launched its campaign against illegal drugs in 2016, official figures indicate that at least 8,663 people have been killed, with some estimates putting the real toll at more than triple that number. The UN Human Rights Office has also documented that, between 2015 and 2019, at least 248 human rights defenders, legal professionals, journalists and trade unionists have been killed in relation to their work.
There has been near impunity for these killings, with only one conviction for the killing of a drug suspect in a police operation since mid-2016, the report stated. Witnesses, family members, journalists and lawyers interviewed by the UN Human Rights Office expressed fears over their safety and a sense of powerlessness in the search for justice, resulting in a situation where “the practical obstacles to accessing justice within the country are almost insurmountable.”
Given the failure of domestic mechanisms to ensure accountability thus far, the report stressed the need for independent, impartial, credible investigations into all allegations of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The High Commissioner stands ready to assist credible efforts towards accountability at the national and international level.
The UN Human Rights Office examined the key policy documents relating to the campaign against illegal drugs and found a troubling lack of due process protections, and the use of language calling for “negation” and “neutralization” of drug suspects.
“Such ill-defined and ominous language, coupled with repeated verbal encouragement by the highest level of State officials to use lethal force, may have emboldened police to treat the circular as permission to kill,” the report stated.
Police raids on private households were routinely carried out without warrants, and post-operational spot reports examined by the Office indicated that evidence may have been falsified. An examination of 25 operations in which 45 people were killed in Metro Manila between August 2016 and June 2017 found that “police repeatedly recovered guns bearing the same serial numbers from different victims in different locations,” suggesting some victims were unarmed at the time of their killing. Arrests of suspected drug offenders have also contributed to a 534 per cent prison congestion rate – among the highest in the world.
While the Philippines has a long-standing and robust tradition of human rights advocacy and activism, with more than 60,000 registered NGOs, human rights defenders have been subject to verbal and physical attacks, threats and legal harassment for nearly 20 years, the report states. The vilification of dissent and attacks against perceived critics, the report said, are being “increasingly institutionalized and normalized in ways that will be very difficult to reverse.”
The phenomenon of “red-tagging” – labelling individuals or groups (including human rights defenders and NGOs) as communists or terrorists – has posed a serious threat to civil society and freedom of expression. The report notes how in some cases those who have been red-tagged were subsequently killed. Others told the UN Human Rights Office they had received death threats or sexually-charged comments in private messages or on social media.
“Human rights advocacy is routinely equated with insurgency and the focus diverted to discrediting the messengers rather than examining the substance of the message,” the report said. “This has muddied the space for debate, disagreement and for challenging State institutions and policies.”
Human rights violations documented in the Philippines have been exacerbated by harmful rhetoric emanating from the highest levels of the Government, which the report described as “pervasive and deeply damaging.” That rhetoric has ranged from degrading comments against women human rights defenders to incitement to extreme violence against civil society actors, journalists, people who use and sell drugs, and indigenous peoples. The use of some of this “incendiary” language “could amount to a violation of the prohibition against arbitrary deprivation of life in Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,” the report said.
In the report, the UN Human Rights Office also detailed ongoing threats to freedom of expression, with legal charges and prosecutions being brought against journalists and senior politicians critical of the Government, as well as actions to shut down media outlets.
The report also examined key national security laws and policies and their impact on human rights, particularly in the southern island of Mindanao, as well as Negros Island, which have seen increased militarization through the imposition of emergency measures. The effect of this militarization – coupled with the long-standing presence of armed groups and the pressure by powerful landed elites and large business projects – is particularly dire on already embattled indigenous and farming communities.
There are concerns that counter-insurgency policies have given rise to patterns resembling “those that characterize the anti-illegal drugs campaign, notably a presumption of guilt and lack of due process or effective oversight – this time against those suspected of supporting the [Communist Party of the Philippines and its New People’s Army],” the report stated.
The report also documents reports of human rights abuses by non-State actors, including killings, abductions, recruitment of children and extortion by the New People’s Army (NPA). The United Nations lists the NPA among parties that commit grave violations affecting children in situations of armed conflict.
The High Commissioner welcomed the substantive engagement between the UN Human Rights Office and the Government of the Philippines in the preparation of the report.
“The Philippines faces major challenges – structural poverty, inequality, armed conflict, frequent natural disasters, and now the COVID-19 crisis,” Bachelet said. “It is vital the Government’s responses be grounded in human-rights approaches and guided by meaningful dialogue. Accountability and full transparency for alleged violations are essential for building public trust. Unfortunately, the report has documented deep-seated impunity for serious human rights violations, and victims have been deprived of justice for the killings of their loved ones. Their testimonies are heartbreaking.”
“People who use or sell drugs do not lose their human rights,” the High Commissioner said. “People who disagree with Government policies and criticize them, including in international fora, should not be vilified as terrorist sympathizers. Indigenous peoples should not be victims of a tug-of-war between the State, non-State armed groups and business interests.”
She said the UN Human Rights Office was ready to support the Philippines – constructively and concretely – in implementing the report’s recommendations, in an effort to halt the many long-standing, widespread human rights violations in the country, and to prevent their recurrence.
The report is based on 893 written submissions, substantial input from the Government of the Philippines, analysis of legislation, police reports, court documents, videos, photos and other open source material, as well as interviews with victims and witnesses. It is due to be discussed at the next UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva.

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks at the launch of the Policy Brief on COVID-19 and People on the Move
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
03 June 2020
COVID-19 continues to devastate lives and livelihoods around the globe — hitting the most vulnerable the hardest.
This is particularly true for millions of people on the move -- such as refugees and internally displaced persons who are forced to flee their homes from violence or disaster, or migrants in precarious situations
Now they face three crises rolled into one.
First, a health crisis — as they become exposed to the virus, often in crowded conditions where social distancing is an impossible luxury — and where basics such as health care, water, sanitation and nutrition are often hard to find.
This impact will be even more devastating to the large number of people on the move who live in least developed countries.  One-third of the world’s internally displaced population live in the 10 countries most at-risk to COVID-19.
Second, people on the move face a socio-economic crisis — especially those working in the informal economy without access to social protection.
In addition, the loss of income from COVID-19 is likely to lead to a colossal $109 billion drop in remittances.  That’s the equivalent of nearly three-quarters of all official development assistance that is no longer being sent back home to the 800 million people who depend on it.
Third, people on the move face a protection crisis.
More than 150 countries have imposed border restrictions to contain the spread of the virus.  At least 99 states make no exception for people seeking asylum from persecution.
At the same time, fear of COVID-19 has led to skyrocketing xenophobia, racism and stigmatization.
And the already precarious situation of women and girls is ever more dire, as they face higher risks of exposure to gender-based violence, abuse and exploitation.
Yet even as refugees and migrants face all these challenges, they are contributing heroically on the frontlines in essential work.
About one in eight of all nurses globally, for example, is practicing in a country different from where they were born.
The COVID-19 crisis is an opportunity to reimagine human mobility.
Four core understandings must guide the way:
First, exclusion is costly and inclusion pays.  An inclusive public health and socio-economic response will help suppress the virus, restart our economies and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.
Second, we must uphold human dignity in the face of the pandemic and learn from the handful of countries that have shown how to implement travel restrictions and border controls while fully respecting human rights and international refugee protection principles.
Third, no-one is safe until everyone is safe.  Diagnostics, treatment and vaccines must be accessible to all.
Fourth and finally, people on the move are part of the solution.  Let us remove unwarranted barriers, explore models to regularize pathways for migrants and reduce transaction costs for remittances.
I am grateful to countries, especially developing countries, that have opened their borders and hearts to refugees and migrants, despite their own social, economic, and now health, challenges.
They offer a moving lesson to others in a period when doors are closed.  It is essential that these countries are provided increased support and full solidarity.
We all have a vested interest to ensure that the responsibility of protecting the world’s refugees is equitably shared and that human mobility remains safe, inclusive, and respects international human rights and refugee law.
No country can fight the pandemic or manage migration alone.
But together, we can contain the spread of the virus, buffer its impact on the most vulnerable and recover better for the benefit of all.
Thank you.

Title: UN-Habitat holds dialogue on designing pandemic-resilient cities
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
02 June 2020
A Kapihan at Usapang Urban session, UN-Habitat Philippines’s informal dialogue platform for partners and urban stakeholders, was held on the topic “Designing Pandemic-Resilient Cities: Insights from the COVID-19 Experience”.
Attended by over 40 people, including UN-Habitat staff and representatives from national partners such as the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) and the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), the Kapihan aimed to 1) promote the sharing of experiences and insights on the current pandemic and its implications on resilience of cities, particularly on slums and informal settlements, urban planning and design, and basic urban services, with citations of current examples of country responses and 2) search for solutions to challenges on how to improve existing programs, projects and policies in addressing future health crises and overall resilience of cities in the emerging post-pandemic scenario.
UN-Habitat Country Programme Manager Cris Rollo shared UN-Habitat’s Covid-19 Response at the global and local levels. Guest speakers who gave technical presentations included Bert Smolders of Arcadis, who spoke on the systemic, spatial, and design interventions needed to promote pandemic resilience; Ragene Palma, urban planner and current Westminster University Masters candidate, who spoke on spatial inequality and Covid’s impact on informality; and Louwie Gan, architect and urban planner, who discussed pandemic resilience from a design perspective of Philippine spaces.
Emerging from the challenges and recommendations in the presentations were shared principles between climate resilience and pandemic resilience when it came to urban planning and design interventions, such as a needed increase in green open spaces, increased walkability, more sustainable and climate-friendly transport options, equitable access to basic and social services, improved connectivity and mobility within and among neighborhoods, better shelter planning, and a push for build-with-nature approaches. The urban poor, informal settlers and other disadvantaged groups, already with pre-existing vulnerabilities, were highlighted to be among the least resilient to the pandemic  The discussion and recommendations showed how recovery from the crisis brought by the pandemic can offer opportunities to improve livelihoods, food security, environment, health, and human settlements.
Among the participants was DHSUD OIC for the Office of the Undersecretary, Commissioner Marylin Pintor who spoke on the role of DHSUD amid the Covid context and resilience building: “DHSUD is happy to participate in this learning exchange on the implications of COVID-19 on urban planning and design as the department is now addressing this pandemic within its mandates. This includes a policy allowing developers and contractors to go back to work even during the community quarantine (productive worksite quarantine). We came up with a department order setting the mandatory requirements before they be allowed to resume work and parameters on how they should conduct their work to protect their workers and customers.  The department is also engaging homeowners’ associations (HOAs) for them to help ensure that health protocols are in place and disseminated among their members. Guidelines for the location of health facilities, isolation areas, crematoriums should be considered in land use plans. Urban design recommendations for sanitation and hygiene should also be promoted.”
“This exchange can help us improve our existing programs in addressing future health crises and overall resilience of cities,” Commissioner Pintor remarked.
“The pandemic opens conversations on how we can re-shape cities,“ said LCP Executive Director Gail Pamintuan. “COVID19 has exacerbated existing problems and made us reflect on the livability of our cities especially for the vulnerable sectors. We need to revisit our urban plans and designs and evaluate them using a health lens. We also [need to focus] on community and social planning so we can empower them. These people need post-pandemic support for community recovery.”
“Definitely, we need to implement bold policies that are responsive to the new normal.
LCP welcomes suggestions so they can innovate, respond effectively to crisis,” Executive Director Pamintuan said, adding that she appreciates the local initiatives and best practices shared during the Kapihan.
Results of the session aim to inform the succeeding planned sessions on urban planning and design and, eventually, the development of enhanced national and local policies.

Title: UN urges Bangsamoro Government to investigate Maguindanao conflict killing two children
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
29 May 2020
MANILA, 28 May 2020 –The United Nations in the Philippines offers its deepest condolences to the families and communities of the two children killed on 24th May 2020 in the recent armed conflict in Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Maguindanao. The United Nations also wishes those who were injured in the incident a quick and speedy recovery.
“We join the Government of the Republic of the Philippines in condemning these attacks, which violate international human rights and humanitarian law. The indiscriminate use of weapons impacting civilian areas must stop,” said Mr. Gustavo Gonzalez, UN Resident Coordinator in the Philippines.
Armed attacks resulting in the death of innocent children are unacceptable. Children have the fundamental right to be safe and be protected from violence so that they can enjoy their childhood and reach their full potential.
“We reiterate the urgent appeal to halt hostilities, protect children in the Philippines and safeguard their well-being,” UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov added.
The United Nations Resident Coordinator and UNICEF Representative co-chair the UN country task force on monitoring grave violations of children's rights in situations of armed conflict. The Philippine task force was created in 2008, in response to the UN Security Council’s Adoption of Resolution 1612 (2005) that called for the establishment of operational country-level task forces. The task force is composed of UN agencies and human rights organizations that support the Philippine government in developing policies and programmes for children affected by armed conflict.
The UN country task force strongly urges all parties to the conflict in the Philippines to demonstrate their commitment to international humanitarian law and uphold the protection and wellbeing of forcibly displaced children, in line with the Republic Act. 11188, Special Protection of Children in Situations of Armed Conflict Act.

Title: More than one in six youth out of work due to COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
28 May 2020
GENEVA (ILO News) – More than one in six young people have stopped working since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic while those who remain employed have seen their working hours cut by 23 per cent, says the International Labour Organization (ILO).
According to the ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work: 4th edition, youth are being disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and the substantial and rapid increase in youth unemployment seen since February is affecting young women more than young men.
The pandemic is inflicting a triple shock on young people. Not only is it destroying their employment, but it is also disrupting education and training, and placing major obstacles in the way of those seeking to enter the labour market or to move between jobs.
At 13.6 per cent, the youth unemployment rate in 2019 was already higher than for any other group. There were around 267 million young people not in employment, education or training (NEET) worldwide. Those 15-24 year olds who were employed were also more likely to be in forms of work that leave them vulnerable, such as low paid occupations, informal sector work, or as migrant workers.
“The COVID-19 economic crisis is hitting young people – especially women – harder and faster than any other group. If we do not take significant and immediate action to improve their situation, the legacy of the virus could be with us for decades. If their talent and energy is side-lined by a lack of opportunity or skills it will damage all our futures and make it much more difficult to re-build a better, post-COVID economy,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder.
The Monitor calls for urgent, large-scale and targeted policy responses to support youth, including broad-based employment/training guarantee programmes in developed countries, and employment-intensive programmes and guarantees in low- and middle- income economies.
Testing and tracing pays off
The 4th edition of the Monitor also looks at measures to create a safe environment for returning to work. It says that rigorous testing and tracing (TT) of COVID-19 infections, “is strongly related to lower labour market disruption…. [and] substantially smaller social disruptions than confinement and lockdown measures.”
In countries with strong testing and tracing, the average fall in working hours is reduced by as much as 50 per cent. There are three reasons for this: TT reduces reliance on strict confinement measures; promotes the public confidence and so encourages consumption and supports employment; and helps minimise operational disruption at the workplace.
In addition, testing and tracing can itself create new jobs, even if temporary, which can be targeted towards youth and other priority groups.
The Monitor highlights the importance of managing data privacy concerns. Cost is also a factor, but the benefit-to-cost ratio of TT is “highly favourable”.
“Creating an employment-rich recovery that also promotes equity and sustainability means getting people and enterprises working again as soon as possible, in safe conditions,” said Ryder. “Testing and tracing can be an important part of the policy package if we are to fight fear, reduce risk and get our economies and societies moving again quickly.”
Loss of working hours
The Monitor also updates the estimate for the decline in working hours in the first and second quarters of 2020, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. An estimated 4.8 per cent of working hours were lost during Q1 2020 (equivalent to approximately 135 million full-time jobs, assuming a 48-hour working week). This represents a slight upward revision of around 7 million jobs since the third edition of the Monitor. The estimated number of jobs lost in Q2 remain unchanged at 305 million.
From a regional perspective, the Americas (13.1 per cent), and Europe and Central Asia (12.9 per cent) present the largest losses in hours worked in Q2.
The Monitor reiterates its call for immediate and urgent measures to support workers and enterprises along the ILO’s four-pillar strategy: stimulating the economy and employment; supporting enterprises, jobs and incomes; protecting workers in the workplace; relying on social dialogue for solutions.

FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL'S PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE PRIME MINISTERS OF CANADA AND JAMAICA ON THE HIGH-LEVEL EVENT ON FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE ERA OF COVID-19 AND BEYOND
New York, 28 May 2020
Spokesman: I'm delighted to be joined by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, as well as His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness, and His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.
Just before we start, a reminder to all the journalists, please mute your microphones, and we will start with some opening remarks, and then we will take a number of questions.
So, Secretary-General, sir, you have the floor.
Secretary-General:  Hello, everyone. Good afternoon, good evening, or goodnight.
Today’s High-Level Event was a meeting of solidarity with the many developing countries that face catastrophic consequences from COVID-19.
The pandemic continues to cause deep suffering. More than 350,000 people have died; there are 5.5 million cases around the world. Behind these figures there is an unprecedented human tragedy.
The crisis is taking a devastating toll on economies. It is having a particularly dramatic impact on families and communities in developing countries that have fewer resources and weaker social safety nets.
Since the pandemic began, I have pushed for a relief package amounting to a double-digit percentage – more than ten per cent – of the global economy.
Developed countries have announced their own relief packages, because they can. But we have not yet seen enough solidarity with developing countries to provide them with the massive and urgent support they need.
Today, I am encouraged to see 50 Heads of State and Government, the leaders of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Institute for International Finance, the OECD, the special envoys of the United Nations and the African Union and others – the largest gathering of leaders since the pandemic began – coming together around joint solutions to the crisis.
Working groups will now consider six areas for urgent action with the first reporting to a ministerial meeting at the end of July:
First, finding ways to enhance global liquidity so that developing countries have the resources they need to fight the pandemic.
Second, preventing debt crises in all countries at risk, including middle income countries. Such crises risk undermining both the COVID-19 response and sustainable development for years to come.
Third, engaging with private creditors on joint debt relief efforts.
Fourth, aligning global financial systems with the Sustainable Development Goals.
Fifth, ending illicit financial flows, and
Sixth, rebuilding differently, and better.
Everything we do must be aimed at enabling developing countries to fight the pandemic, while keeping their communities, businesses and economies afloat.
Dear friends,
Our world is afflicted by enormous fragilities: weak health systems; runaway climate change; unsustainable levels of inequality.
We see other signs of this fragility everywhere, from the increasing risk of nuclear proliferation to the lawlessness of cyberspace.
Ignoring these warning signs is senseless arrogance. Existential threats demand humility, unity and solidarity.
We cannot contemplate a return to the same failed priorities and systems. We must invest in a sustainable and inclusive recovery.
Too often, speed and greed have triumphed over compassion, solidarity and humanity.
This pandemic is reminding us that the important things in life require investment – in people; in physical and mental wellbeing; in protecting our environment and in combating inequalities, including gender inequality.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change address precisely the failures that are being exposed and exploited by COVID-19.
I want to thank my co-hosts, Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau and Andrew Holness, whose countries co-chair the Group of Friends of Sustainable Development.
And I thank all those who have come together in solidarity today to work together on a different and better world for our children and generations to come.
Thank you.
Spokesman:  Thank you very much, Secretary-General. It is now my great pleasure to give the floor to the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness. Sir, you have the floor.
Prime Minister Holness: Thank you. As you have seen from the widespread participation at today’s meeting, the international community is united and committed to taking the action required to mount a robust and coordinated response to the devastating economic and human impacts of COVID-19.
Over 50 Heads of State and Government responded to our invitation to participate at this High-Level Event.
It is fitting that the UN has taken the initiative as our co-convenor in this regard, as it comprises the broadest and most inclusive range of countries of any international organization.
By leveraging its convening power, the UN and its Member States have today launched a partnership with key stakeholders, including the private sector and civil society.
Our aim is to facilitate a process to devise concrete solutions to the development emergency that stems from the COVID-19 pandemic.
As we heard today, there is general agreement that our response to this pandemic will require a large-scale, comprehensive multilateral effort. We are determined to support countries, particularly those most in need. Our goal is to not only relieve the hardship they are currently experiencing, but to enable them to recover better.
By recovering better, we mean that countries vulnerable to systemic shock must be made more resilient, from an economic, social and environmental standpoint. Our overarching objective is to create the conditions for sustainable, just, inclusive economies and societies.
After all, this is the collective endeavour to which we all committed in 2015. We remain focused on achieving the SDGs and in implementing the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) we agreed to under the Paris Climate Accord.
The next stage in this process involves the work that will be undertaken by the six thematic working groups that has been established.
These groups will comprise representatives of government, international financial institutions and other key actors.
Their mandate will be to build on the ideas that emerged from today’s discussions, with a view to developing concrete solutions to address the crisis. They will report to us, the three co-convenors, on three occasions throughout the rest of this year: in July during the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), in mid-September at the opening of the 75th session of the General Assembly, and in mid-December.
With that said, I look forward to your questions.
Spokesman:  Thank you very much, Prime Minister. I now give the floor to the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.
Prime Minister Trudeau: Thank you. First, I want to thank my co-hosts, Secretary-General Guterres and Prime Minister Holness of Jamaica.
I also want to thank everyone who joined us today for this important discussion.
We brought together not just over 50 world leaders, but private sector actors and representatives from bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank because every single one of us will have a key role to play on the road to global recovery.
Pour assurer la sécurité des Canadiens et vaincre la COVID-19 pour de bon, on doit regarder au-delà de nos frontières.
On doit se rappeler que la COVID-19 n’est pas seulement une crise sanitaire, mais une crise économique d’envergure mondiale.
Le Canada est un pays commerçant avec des liens familiaux partout dans le monde.
On comprend que nos emplois, nos entreprises, nos travailleurs, notre économie dépendent en partie d’une économie mondiale en bonne santé.
Et en pleine pandémie, on ne peut pas fermer les yeux sur le monde dans lequel on vit.
We can’t forget about the most vulnerable, whether that’s people far away who are struggling, or people in the Caribbean who have been among the hardest hit.
The global pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for our modern world, but it’s also a unique opportunity to adjust our international institutions, so that they are more fit for purpose.
Today, we began a conversation on how we can emerge from this global crisis as a stronger and more cohesive world.
We are forming six discussion groups to submit concrete proposals by mid-July on the path forward.
Groups will strive to:
Protect the progress we’ve made in international development by expanding liquidity and maintaining financial stability in the global economy.
Save lives and livelihoods for billions around the world by helping developing countries deal with debt vulnerabilities.
Encourage private sector creditors to be part of the solution
Enhance external finance and remittances to create growth and jobs.
Prevent illicit financial flows to expand fiscal space and encourage domestic resource mobilization.
Ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery by aligning policies with the Sustainable Development Goals. [Ends]

Title: UN Secretary-General's Message for the International Day of UN Peacekeepers, 29 May 2020
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
27 May 2020
The video message is found here.
[Filipino translation found below]
Today we honor more than one million men and women who have served as United Nations peacekeepers and the more than 3,900 who have lost their lives in the line of duty.
We also express our gratitude to the 95,000 civilian, police and military personnel currently deployed around the world.
They are facing one of the greatest challenges ever: delivering on their peace and security mandates while helping countries to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
The theme of this year’s observance – Women in Peacekeeping – highlights their central role in our operations.
Women often have greater access in the communities we serve, enabling us to improve the protection of civilians, promote human rights and enhance overall performance.
This is especially important today, as female peacekeepers are on the frontlines in supporting the response to COVID-19 in already fragile contexts – using local radio to spread public health messaging, delivering necessary supplies to communities for prevention, and supporting efforts of local peacebuilders. Yet, women continue to represent only 6 per cent of uniformed military, police, justice and corrections personnel in field missions.
As we commemorate the 20th anniversary of Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, we must do more to achieve women’s equal representation in all areas of peace and security.
Together, let us continue to wage peace, defeat the pandemic and build a better future. [Ends]
Filipino translation as follows:
Sa araw na ito, binibigyang papauri natin ang higit sa isandaang milyong kalalakihan at kababaihan na nagsilbi bilang United Nations peacekeepers at ang higit sa 3,900 na pumanaw sa pagganap ng kanilang tungkulin.
Pinasasalamatan din natin ang 95,000 sibilyan, pulis at sandatahang tauhan na kasalukuyang nanunungkulan sa buong mundo.
Hinaharap nila ang isa sa pinakamahirap na hamon sa kanilang buhay: ang pagpapanatili sa katahimikan at seguridad habang tumutulong sa mga bansa na labanan ang COVID-19.
Ang tema ng pagtalima natin ngayong taon—Kababaihan sa Pagpapapnatili ng Katahimikan—ay nagpapatunay sa kanilang kahalagahan sa peacekeeping operations ng UN.
Malimit ay mas nararating ng mga babae ang mga komunidad na ating pinagsisilbihan, at dahil dito, napapabuti natin ang pangangalaga sa mga sibilyan, naitataguyod ang karapatang pangtao, at gumaganda ang ating gawain.
Ito ay mas lalong mahalaga ngayon, dahil ang mga babaeng peacekeeper ay nasa bungad ng pagsusuporta sa pagtugon sa COVID-19 sa mga lugar na marupok na—sa paggamit ng radio upang isahimpapawid ang mensaheng pangkalusugan, sa paghahatid ng kinakailangang kagamitan sa mga komunidad. Sa kabila nito, ang kababaihan ay bumubuo ng anim na porsiyento lamang ng unipormadong sundalo, pulis, at namamahala sa hustisya at mga preso sa field missions.
Habang inaalala natin ang ika-20 anibersaryo ng Security Council Resolution 1325, patungkol sa Kababaihan, Katahimikan at Seguridad, kailangang magsumikap pa tayo upang makamit ang pantay na pangangatawan ng mga babae sa lahat ng aspeto ng katahimikan at seguridad.
Sama-sama nating patuloy na ipaglaban ang katahimikan, talunin ang pandemya at bumuo ng mas magandang hinaharap. [Nagtatapos]

Title: Bangsamoro youth boosts community education and engagement on COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
25 May 2020
Lanao del Sur, 25 May 2020 – The Coalition of Moro Youth Movement (CMYM) conducted a community education and engagement campaign to fight misinformation on COVID-19 in the Bangsamoro Region.
With support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Australian Embassy in the Philippines, the CMYM conducted its information dissemination efforts in Lanao del Sur and other areas in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) through social media to curb the spread of fake news and misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic.
Capitalizing on their significant social media following, the CMYM shared materials providing updated information and responses to frequently asked questions about COVID-19. These were translated into Maranao, the local language in Lanao del Sur, in order to adapt to the local communities in the province.
In areas where internet connection is limited, the CMYM distributed flyers to ensure that people are updated with correct information and also partnered with local radios to further disseminate information in remote areas. The youth coalition also partnered with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) members, faith-based leaders and local government units in their COVID-19 prevention and response efforts.
“I commend and support this initiative as it would minimize the impact of the pandemic to our community. It is not unknown to us that this false information sometimes ends up being more harmful than the pandemic itself,” said MP Marjanie S. Mimbantas Macasalong, Member of Bangsamoro Transition Authority and Executive Director of Bangsamoro Youth Commission.
Alongside the BARMM government’s efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the region, the CMYM also distributed over 700 sets of hygiene kits among frontline workers in 54 barangays in Lanao del Sur province. Among the recipients were members of Barangay Peacekeeping Action Teams (BPAT) and Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT). The hygiene kits distribution was also supported by the Bangsamoro Youth Commission and the Office of MP Marjanie Macasalong.
The CMYM is a consortium of Moro youth groups advocating for peace and inclusive development.

Title: UNICEF mobilizes $3 million aid to Philippine Government’s COVID-19 response
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
22 May 2020
MANILA, 22 MAY 2020 – UNICEF Philippines scales up its support to the government through the Department of Health (DOH) in its efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
In support of the country’s battle against COVID-19, UNICEF Philippines recently procured supplies which include 72,000 sets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) for health staff, 450,000 masks (N95 and surgical masks) for health staff and 500 PPEs for cleaning staff.
The PPE kits for health workers include face shields, masks (either surgical or N95), gloves and coverall suits. The cleaning and disinfection kits include soaps, mops, buckets, dippers, alcohol dispensers, cleaning cloths and brushes, as well as bleach, ethyl alcohol and laundry detergent.
UNICEF is also providing 64 multi-purpose tents to scale up ward capacities for hospitals in affected regions. The supplies and protective equipment are complementing UNICEF’s ongoing support and the technical assistance to the Department of Health (DOH) and other partners.
A total US$ 3 million have been mobilized to date through UNICEF, including donations by the Government of Japan, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), the UN Foundations’ Solidarity Response Fund, and United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
This assistance is crucial for healthcare institutions and community frontliners in conducting contact tracing and in the continuous provision of non-COVID19 community health services such as the expanded program on immunization.
“Children’s health remains to be a priority of the department during this pandemic. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to have their children vaccinated because vaccines have been proven safe and effective in preventing life-threatening diseases in children,” Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said.
Parents and caregivers are reminded to follow the vaccination schedule of their children and closely coordinate with their local health office for any adjustments amid the ongoing COVID-19 response. DOH also enjoins Local Health Offices, Rural Health Units, and Barangay Health Stations to continuously provide child health services in their communities.
“Aside from immunization, we encourage parents to access other essential child health services. We are also exploring to implement other effective vaccination strategies such as scheduled fixed-post vaccinations (i,e. scheduled vaccination in designated areas such as barangay health stations, gymnasiums, etc.) in adherence to community quarantine protocols and the call for Filipinos to stay at home,” the Health Chief added.
“We are one with the Department of Health, WHO and other United Nations agencies in the country’s response to COVID-19. We continue employing every effort to contribute to the safety of frontline health workers, while supporting the continuity of essential health services for children across the country,” said UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov.
UNICEF is complementing DOH’s efforts to train health workers. Around 3,500 health workers, sanitary engineers and inspectors have been trained in infection prevention and control.
Over 66 million people have been reached with health and hygiene messages on Social Media, Radio and SMS, also translated into Maguindanaon, Maranao, Sama, Tausug and Teduray languages.
With the latest shipment of supplies, UNICEF is also stepping up assistance to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as it responds to COVID-19 cases across the region.

Title: Why we must help – and learn from – refugees this Ramadan
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 May 2020
This Ramadan is unlike any other in living memory. Across the Muslim world mosques stand empty, iftar meals are strangely quiet affairs, and the joyful social gatherings that normally mark the Holy Month have been abandoned as we grapple with a global health emergency.
For many families, these disconcerting times have been made worse by the dire economic impact of the pandemic. Businesses and livelihoods have been damaged or lost, leading many to question how they will cope during this period and beyond.
For millions of Muslims displaced from their homes or countries by conflict and instability, the current crisis has compounded their suffering. Their health is threatened by an invisible menace they are poorly equipped to tackle, with refugees and displaced people often living in crowded conditions and lacking adequate access to water, sanitation and health services.
The sudden collapse of informal labour markets caused by restrictions on movement has had a disproportionate effect on the poorest in society, including the displaced. With no savings to fall back on, many are facing destitution and taking desperate measures to survive.
My colleagues in UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, who are working on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis report many worrying trends. Large numbers of refugees and displaced people unable to afford rent have been made homeless or are facing the threat of eviction, while others resort to skipping meals or going without medication due to a lack of funds.
Yet despite the frightening and unfamiliar circumstances we find ourselves in, the values of compassion and giving that Ramadan represents have come to the fore. Though physically separated, the faithful are coming together in spirit to provide much-needed assistance and spiritual comfort to their Muslim brothers and sisters.
This year’s UNHCR Ramadan fundraising campaign, “Every Gift Counts”, is on course to generate record support, with more than US$4 million raised in individual donations as we enter the last week of Ramadan.
The funds raised will allow UNHCR to meet some of the most pressing needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by providing vital support such as shelter, food, clean water and cash assistance to the most vulnerable refugee and displaced populations.
In many parts of the world, meanwhile, refugees themselves are doing what they can to help others through the crisis. From the Syrian refugees delivering food and running errands for vulnerable locals in Switzerland, to the Afghan refugees in Malaysia making protective equipment for frontline health workers, they embody the spirit of collective action needed to meet this global challenge.
Take the example of Huda, a Syrian widow who has spent the last five years in a refugee settlement in Lebanon with her children. Despite living in extreme poverty and having to borrow money to survive, this Ramadan she is taking what little she has and cooking large meals to share with her neighbours to help them celebrate the Holy Month.
The pandemic has brought great loss and hardship, but it has also spurred acts of kindness and compassion and seen many of us reconsider what is truly important in our lives. These moments of generosity and spiritual reflection represent the core values of Ramadan and show us that even during a crisis, there is an opportunity for progress and self-improvement.
This Ramadan, many of the world’s Muslims find themselves having to adjust to a new reality, stranded away from home or separated from their friends and loved ones. But there is much that can be learned from the experience of refugees, for whom this has been the norm for years or even decades.
Their resilience and courage in the face of adversity. Their devotion to family and friends. Their instinct to share responsibility for helping those less fortunate within their communities.
As we worry about when we can be reunited with our friends and family and resume our normal lives, it is worth remembering that those displaced by conflict, violence and persecution are faced with these uncertainties, and many more, every day. The grace and fortitude with which they respond can be an inspiration to us all. [Ends]

Title: UNHCR urges sustained support to protect world’s forcibly displaced from “devastating” impact of coronavirus
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 May 2020
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is seeking US$745 million as it races to prepare for and prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 among refugees and other displaced populations around the globe. This is UNHCR’s portion of the revised UN Global Humanitarian Response Plan appealing for US$6.7 billion, launched last Thursday. Based on the latest assessments of global needs to curb the impact of the pandemic among forcibly displaced, it is an upward revision of the initial US$255 million sought in the earlier appeal for UNHCR on 25 March.
With coronavirus now present in every country, including those that host large refugee and displaced populations, the world’s 71 million refugees and forcibly displaced people are among the most exposed and vulnerable to the threat of the virus.
While no outbreaks have so far been reported in large refugee and IDP settlements, UNHCR is rapidly responding in 134 refugee-hosting countries that are reporting local transmission.
“The pandemic is inflicting deep wounds across the world, particularly for women and the elderly. For people who fled wars and persecution, the impact on their mostly hand-to-mouth existence and on their hosts has been devastating,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “Together with our NGO partners, the UN is determined to stay the course and deliver for people forced to flee and their hosts, to ensure their inclusion in public health responses and access to social safety nets.”
As of today, the coronavirus has infected more than four million people globally, and claimed nearly 280,000 lives. As the disease is not expected to peak in the world’s poorest countries for another three to six months, UNHCR teams around the world are preparing fast – and bracing for the worst.
The evidence of deep and hard-hitting economic impact of the crisis on refugees is overwhelming. Across the Middle East and Africa, hundreds of thousands of refugees have asked for urgent financial assistance to cover their daily essential needs since lockdowns and other public health measures came into force in many countries in March. In Lebanon, which was facing an economic downturn even before the pandemic, over half of the refugees surveyed by UNHCR in late April reported having lost livelihoods such as daily labour. Among the refugees consulted, 70 per cent reported that they had to skip meals. The impact on refugee women is profound, with almost all who were working saying they had seen their income source disrupted.
UNHCR is worried that the loss of daily wages and livelihoods can result in psycho-social hardship. In Jordan, partners report a significant rise in mental health and psycho-social consultations since March.
Groups at a particular risk of poverty and exploitation include female heads of households, unaccompanied and separated children, older people and LGBTI people. Their situation can be improved through emergency assistance, notably through emergency cash grants.
Thanks to prompt and generous contributions from government and private supporters, UNHCR quickly ramped up its coronavirus response. In a matter of weeks, UNHCR procured and delivered to field operations more than 6.4 million face masks, 850,000 gowns, 3,600 oxygen concentrators, 640 ventilators, over 1,600 housing units and 50 hospital tents. In addition, six tonnes of personal protection equipment (PPE) and medical supplies have been airlifted and US$30 million COVID-19 related cash assistance has been distributed in 65 countries.
The funds will help UNHCR further strengthen national health and sanitation systems through increased provision of personal protective equipment, medicine, soap and other hygiene supplies. UNHCR is also working to: ramp up cash assistance for the most vulnerable refugee families experiencing economic shocks; improve shelters in crowded settlements to prevent human-to-human transmission; and provide multiple months’ supplies of aid and sanitation items during distributions that maintain physical distancing recommendations.
Funds will also ensure UNHCR can scale up its protection and assistance, including child protection and sexual and gender-based violence services. UNHCR is urgently adapting life-saving protection programmes for survivors of violence and advocating to ensure that health, psycho-social support and safety services are designated as essential and remain accessible to refugees and the forcibly displaced.
Over eighty per cent of the world’s refugees and nearly all of the world’s internally displaced people are hosted in low- to middle-income countries, some of them hit hard by conflict, hunger, poverty and disease. Many of the forcibly displaced are in camps or densely populated urban areas, often living in inadequate conditions with limited, fragile public health, sanitation facilities and social protection systems.
Consequently, UNHCR is prioritizing preparedness and prevention measures to curb the threat of the pandemic. These are critical measures for avoiding a higher fatality rate among refugees and displaced populations due to often overcrowded living conditions and limited health and water and sanitation infrastructure.
The funds requested within UNHCR’s revised COVID-19 appeal are to cover UNHCR’s budgetary needs to respond to coronavirus until the end of the year. UNHCR is grateful to those donors who have already contributed vital funding. Early support from the United States of America, Germany, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Denmark, Canada, Ireland, Sony Corporation, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Australia, as well as from individual private donors from across the world, allowed us to scale up activities globally.

Title: The case for going cashless
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 May 2020
When India placed its entire population of 1.3 billion under lockdown, it took them merely a week to make payments to 204 million people. At roughly the same time, the Philippines began pushing out COVID-19-related payments to 18 million beneficiaries. A few months on, nearly 2 million are waiting for their money with 600 of the 1008 LGUs still in the process of making payments.  The fundamental difference between the two countries is the existence of fully digitized social safety net programs with three foundational elements: government-issued digital IDs to prove citizens are who they say they are; financial accounts for beneficiaries to receive money; and widespread use of mobile phones (not only smart phones) with easy access to payments. India pressed a computer key to make the payments, while the Philippines walked a bag full of cash door to door.
The contrast is particularly ironic as the Philippines was one of the region’s early movers in digital payments.  The rate of these payments has increased significantly, jumping from 1% of total monthly transactions five years ago to 10% today. Regulatory and legislative barriers to digitization have mostly been removed. The introduction of PESONet and InstaPay enables fund transfers between accounts. Quick Response (QR) codes allow ‘point and pay’. The National Payments Systems Act provides the necessary legislation. The Data Privacy Act, if effectively implemented, addresses concerns about the use of data to monitor individuals.  Mobile money operators like GCash and Paymaya continue to increase their customer base and refine their product offerings.  A National ID system is theoretically ready for roll out.
But very little of this is currently benefitting the poor.  To speed up social transfers and ensure financial inclusion of the poorest, a concerted and collaborative effort is urgently required.  Key stakeholders need to cooperate closely to establish an integrated ecosystem that builds on the technology, and the legal and regulatory enabling environment already available.
Civil society and education institutions can help by providing financial and digital literacy training to those receiving payments using a core curriculum to build understanding and trust in digital transactions. Telcos can ensure the connectivity of remote areas and make data downloads for use of digital payment applications affordable. Mobile money operators can reduce fees and charges and improve the user experience for poor beneficiaries and small and micro enterprises. The chambers of commerce can work with these merchants to promote acceptance of digital transactions and encourage the use of QR codes and provision of cash out facilities. Government agencies—national and local—can deliver on BSP’s digital financial inclusion ambitions by prioritizing a rapid shift to digital payments, not only to beneficiaries, but also to their own staff. The highest levels of government can insist on the transparency and cost-efficiency that is possible through digital payments.
A digital transition at scale and speed is achievable. Two decades ago, China was basically a cash economy. They are now at the point where their Central Bank forbids discrimination against cash by merchants. The take-up across Chinese society – even among low income earners - has been remarkable. The tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have driven the change, boosting their customer base from zero to 100 million in 5 years and now have 700 million unique users. $5.5 trillion of payments have been made through QR codes. What they have done, and we need to learn from, is that beyond legislation, regulation and technology, they created a compelling value proposition by quickly deepening the payment ecosystem. They reduced on-boarding and transaction frictions by making enrolment easy, kept fees low, addressed connectivity issues and leveraged loyalty rewards.
The case for going fully digital at speed is clear. It will dramatically cut down on inefficiencies, facilitate e-commerce and contact less transactions, and reduce leakage. Most importantly, it will quickly provide formal financial services to the two out of three Filipinos that are unbanked and provide the Philippines with the means to reach most of the population by simply pressing a computer key.

Title: UNHCR urges prioritization of mental health support in coronavirus response
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
18 May 2020
“COVID-19 is not just a physical health crisis but it is now also triggering a mental health crisis. While many refugees and internally displaced people are remarkably resilient and are able to move forward despite having experienced violence or persecution first-hand, their capacities to cope are now being stretched to the limit,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi.
“We are now receiving reports of increasing mental health issues and needs among those displaced. Fear of infection, confinement and isolation measures, stigma, discrimination, loss of livelihoods and uncertainty about the future are all contributing factors”.
Given the widespread socio-economic damage inflicted by the pandemic, UNHCR is particularly worried that for many refugees, the loss of daily wages and livelihoods is resulting in psychosocial hardship. Extremely concerning is that some are now reporting self-harm owing to these pressures.
For refugees who had also sought psychosocial support through community interaction, social gatherings or the observance of religious rituals, physical distancing measures and mobility restrictions also affect their ability to cope with emotional distress.
While the consequences of the pandemic are inducing or aggravating pre-existing mental health conditions, measures to curb the spread of the virus are also impacting the availability of assistance. Providing mental health support and care becomes more difficult during lock-down and restricted travel, staffing levels may be reduced, refugees are often unable to travel to reach care and many face-to-face group-based activities have been cancelled.
“The overwhelming majority, 84 per cent, of the world’s refugees are hosted in developing regions and their access to quality mental health care was already very limited even before the pandemic. Now at this devastating juncture, with coronavirus causing great physical and mental affliction, the need to invest in continued health services, including mental health, and ensuring their accessibility to all is as evident and critical as ever,” said Grandi.
To try and ensure the continuity of mental health and psychosocial support services for refugees and displaced people, UNHCR is stepping up efforts and adapting modalities wherever possible.
Some mental health services are now being provided remotely, including through multi-lingual telephone hotlines or over the internet through online sessions. For those with severe and complex mental health conditions, care is being ensured through remote or direct support delivered in safe ways, including through home visits. Provisions are also made to ensure that people who need medication can continue treatment during lockdown.
UNHCR is also working where possible to scale up the mental health support capacity of its pre-existing community-based protection networks and training primary healthcare workers, camp management personnel, community outreach volunteers and telephone hotline staff in Psychological First Aid.
In some locations, community volunteers already mobilized in COVID-19 prevention and response efforts are also conducting outreach to refugees and internally displaced people on mental health awareness and on coping with distress.
Echoing the UN-wide call for action, UNHCR continues to appeal for urgent support to ensure the availability and continuation of mental health and psychosocial services for refugees and those displaced. These services must be considered “essential” services and form part of national responses to COVID-19.

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
17 May 2020
The world marks International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT) at a time of great challenge.
Among the many severe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is the increased vulnerability of LGBTI people.  Already facing bias, attacks and murder simply for who they are or whom they love, many LGBTI people are experiencing heightened stigma as a result of the virus, as well as new obstacles when seeking health care.  There are also reports of COVID-19 directives being misused by police to target LGBTI individuals and organizations.
As the pandemic unfolds, the United Nations will continue to highlight these and other injustices, as well as the need for everyone to be protected and included in the response to the crisis.  Together, let us stand united against discrimination and for the right of all to live free and equal in dignity and rights.

Title: Healthy oceans: Keeping Asia and the Pacific afloat
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
15 May 2020
BANGKOK: Memories of idyllic beaches and sonorous waves may seem far away while we remain at home. Yet, we need not look far to appreciate the enduring history of the ocean in Asia and the Pacific. For generations, the region has thrived on our seas. Our namesake bears a nod to the Pacific Ocean, a body of water tethered to the well-being of billions in our region. The seas provide food, livelihood and a sense of identity, especially for coastal communities in the Pacific island states.
Sadly, escalating strains on the marine environment are threatening to drown progress and our way of life. In less than a century, climate change and unsustainable resource management have degraded ecosystems and diminished biodiversity. Levels of overfishing have exponentially increased, leaving fish stocks and food systems vulnerable. Marine plastic pollution coursing through the region’s rivers have contributed to most of the debris flooding the ocean. While the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic has temporarily reduced emissions and pollution on the ocean, this should not be moment of reprieve. Rather, recovery efforts have the potential to rebuild a new reality, embedded in sustainability and resilience. It is time to take transformative action for the ocean, together.
Despite a seascape celebrated in our collective imaginations, research shows that our picture of the ocean is remarkably shallow. Insights from “Changing Sails: Accelerating Regional Actions for Sustainable Oceans in Asia and the Pacific,” the theme study of this year’s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), reveal that without data, we are swimming in the dark. Data are available for only two out of 10 targets for Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. Because of limitations in methodology and national statistical systems, information gaps have persisted at uneven levels across countries. Defeating Covid-19 has been a numbers game and we need similar commitment to data for the state of our shores.
While there is much we cannot see, images of plastic pollution have become commonplace.
Asia and the Pacific produces nearly half of global plastic by volume, of which it consumes 38 percent. Plastics represent a double burden for the ocean: their production generates carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean, and as a final product enter the ocean as pollution. Beating this challenge will hinge upon effective national policies and rethinking production cycles.
Environmental decline is also affecting dwindling fish stocks. Our region’s position as the world’s largest producer of fish has come at the cost of overexploitation. The percentage of stocks fished at unsustainable levels has increased threefold from 10 percent in 1974 to 33 percent in 2015. Generating complete data on fish stocks, fighting illicit fishing activity and conserving marine areas must remain a priority.
Economic activity from shipping must also be sustainable. While the most connected shipping economies are in Asia, the small island developing states of the Pacific experience much lower levels of connectivity, leaving them relatively isolated from the global economy.
Closing the maritime connectivity gap must be placed at the center of regional transport cooperation efforts. We must also work with the shipping community to navigate toward green shipping. As an ocean-based industry, shipping directly affects the health of the marine ecosystem. Enforcing sustainable shipping policies is essential to mitigate maritime pollution.
The magnitude of our ocean and its challenges represent how extensive and collaborative our solutions must be. Transboundary ocean management and linking ocean data call for close cooperation among countries in the region. Harnessing ocean statistics through strong national statistical systems will serve as a compass guiding countries to monitor trends, devise timely responses and clear blind spots impeding action. Through the Ocean Accounts Partnership, Escap is working with countries to harmonize ocean data and provide a space for regular dialogue. Translating international agreements and standards into national action is also key. We must fully equip countries and all ocean custodians to localize global agreements into tangible results. Escap is working with member states to implement International Maritime Organization requirements on emissions reduction and environmental standards.
Keeping the oceans plastic-free will depend on policies that promote a circular economy approach. This strategy minimizes resource use and keeps them in use for as long as possible. This will require economic incentives and disincentives, coupled with fundamental lifestyle changes. Several countries in the region have introduced successful single use plastic bans. Escap’s Closing the Loop project is reducing the environmental impact of cities in Southeast Asia by addressing plastic waste pollution and leakages into the marine environment.
Our oceans keep our health, the economy and our lives above the waves. In the post-Covid-19 era, we must use the critical years ahead to steer our collective fleets toward sustainable oceans. With our shared resources and commitment, I am confident we can sail in the right direction.

Title: UNODC, WHO, UNAIDS and OHCHR joint statement on COVID-19 in prisons and other closed settings
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
13 May 2020
We, the leaders of global health, human rights and development institutions, come together to urgently draw the attention of political leaders to the heightened vulnerability of prisoners and other people deprived of liberty to the COVID-19 pandemic, and urge them to take all appropriate public health measures in respect of this vulnerable population that is part of our communities.
Acknowledging that the risk of introducing COVID-19 into prisons or other places of detention varies from country to country, we emphasize the need to minimize the occurrence of the disease in these settings and to guarantee that adequate preventive measures are in place to ensure a gender-responsive approach and preventing large outbreaks of COVID-19. We equally emphasize the need to establish an up-to-date coordination system that brings together health and justice sectors, keeps prison staff well-informed and guarantees that all human rights in these settings are respected.
Reduce overcrowding
In the light of overcrowding in many places of detention, which undermines hygiene, health, safety and human dignity, a health response to COVID-19 in closed settings alone is insufficient. Overcrowding constitutes an insurmountable obstacle for preventing, preparing for or responding to COVID-19.
We urge political leaders to consider limiting the deprivation of liberty, including pretrial detention, to a measure of last resort, particularly in the case of overcrowding, and to enhance efforts to resort to non-custodial measures. These efforts should encompass release mechanisms for people at particular risk of COVID-19, such as older people and people with pre-existing health conditions, as well as other people who could be released without compromising public safety, such as those sentenced for minor, non-violent offences, with specific consideration given to women and children.
A swift and firm response aimed at ensuring healthy and safe custody, and reducing overcrowding, is essential to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 entering and spreading in prisons and other places of deprivation of liberty. Increasing cleanliness and hygiene in places of deprivation of liberty is paramount in order to prevent the entry of, or to limit the spread of, the virus.
Compulsory detention and rehabilitation centres, where people suspected of using drugs or engaging in sex work are detained, without due process, in the name of treatment or rehabilitation should be closed. There is no evidence that such centres are effective in the treatment of drug dependence or rehabilitation of people and the detention of people in such facilities raises human rights issues and threatens the health of detainees, increasing the risks of COVID-19 outbreaks.
Ensuring health, safety and human dignity
All states are required to ensure not only the security, but also the health, safety and human dignity, of people deprived of their liberty and of people working in places of detention at all times. This obligation applies irrespective of any state of emergency.
Decent living and working conditions as well as access to necessary health services free of charge form intrinsic elements of this obligation. There must be no discrimination on the basis of the legal or any other status of people deprived of their liberty. Health care in prisons, including preventive, supportive and curative care, should be of the highest quality possible, at least equivalent to that provided in the community. Priority responses to COVID-19 currently implemented in the community, such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, are often severely restricted or not possible in closed settings.
Ensuring access to continued health services
Prison populations have an overrepresentation of people with substance use disorders, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and hepatitis B and C compared to the general population. The rate of infection of diseases in such a confined population is also higher than among the general population. Beyond the normal infectivity of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with substance use disorders, HIV, hepatitis and TB may be at increased risk of complications from COVID-19.
To ensure that the benefits of treatments started before or during imprisonment are not lost, provisions must be made, in close collaboration with public health authorities, to allow people to continue their treatments without interruption at all stages of detention and upon release. Countries should embrace a health systems approach, where prisons are not separated from the continuity-of-care pathway but integrated with community health services.
Enhancing prevention and control measures in closed settings as well as increasing access to quality health services, including uninterrupted access to the prevention and treatment of HIV, TB, hepatitis and opioid dependence, are therefore required. Authorities must ensure uninterrupted access and flow of quality health commodities to prisons and other places of detention. Staff, health-care professionals and service providers working in closed settings should be recognized as a crucial workforce for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and receive appropriate personal protective equipment and support as necessary.
Respect human rights
In their responses to COVID-19 in closed settings, states must respect the human rights of people deprived of their liberty. Restrictions that may be imposed must be necessary, evidence-informed, proportionate (i.e. the least restrictive option) and non-arbitrary. The disruptive impact of such measures should be actively mitigated, such as through enhanced access to telephones or digital communications if visits are limited. Certain fundamental rights of people deprived of their liberty and corresponding safeguards, including the right to legal representation, as well as the access of external inspection bodies to places of deprivation of liberty, must continue to be fully respected.
Adhere to United Nations rules and guidance
We urge political leaders to ensure that COVID-19 preparedness and responses in closed settings are identified and implemented in line with fundamental human rights, are guided by World Health Organization (WHO) guidance and recommendations and never amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In prisons, any intervention should comply with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules).
People deprived of their liberty exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or who have tested positive should be monitored and treated in line with the most recent WHO guidelines and recommendations. Prisons and other places of detention must be part of national COVID-19 plans with dedicated participation of affected populations. All cases of COVID-19 in closed settings should be notified to responsible public health authorities, who will then report to national and international authorities.
In line with our mandates, we remain available to provide support in the rapid deployment of the recommendations outlined above.

Title: IOM supports displaced persons and communities in fight against COVID-19 in the Philippines
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
12 May 2020
MANILA, Philippines – As the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases rise in the Philippines, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is focusing on supporting against the spread of the pandemic the most vulnerable internally displaced persons (IDPs) and communities across the southern region of Mindanao.
Natural disasters and recurrent conflict have left nearly 300,000 IDPs across the country, primarily in Mindanao. IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) reveals these IDP communities lack access to basic livelihoods, live in close confinement in evacuation centres, and have limited access to health, water, sanitation and hygiene – all factors that significantly increase the risk of COVID-19 community transmission.
With the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on 21 April reaching 6,459 – with 428 deaths – in a country of over 106 million people, IDPs and surrounding communities are considered particularly vulnerable.
Since October 2019, IOM has been working with local government units in the North Cotabato earthquake-affected areas to provide emergency and life-saving assistance, including shelter, camp management assistance and cash support to poor IDPs. Most of the nearly 200,000 earthquake-induced displaced people (more than 48,000 families), are staying in either makeshift shelters exposed to extreme weather elements, or in overcrowded evacuation centres with limited Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities.
Because these living conditions put them at a higher risk of contracting and developing the infectious disease, IOM has been rapidly increasing its activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the IDP communities. That effort has included the construction of 75 WASH facilities – latrines, handwashing stations, and bathing cubicles – in the displacement sites across North Cotabato. Community hygiene and disinfection kits also have been distributed to vulnerable sites to promote infection prevention in communal areas.
Finally, IOM is supporting local COVID-19 contingency planning, focusing on inclusion of communities in camp or camp-like settings.
Kristin Dadey, IOM Chief of Mission in the Philippines said, “We are racing against the clock to work with local government to implement initiatives that will protect the most fragile and displaced populations against COVID-19. This includes building additional water and sanitation facilities in the evacuation centres and implementing cash-for-work schemes that help poor families with no livelihoods to access essential supplies – such as food and medicines. With this, we aim to ensure socioeconomic protection for the IDPs as COVID-19 is having a devasting impact on the local economy.”
The activities are supported by funding from USAID’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and from United Nations Member States through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).
As part of IOM’s revised global COVID-19 Response Plan, the IOM Mission in the Philippines requires USD 6.3 million to support the Government’s efforts to address the health and socio-economic consequences of the pandemic.

[Filipino translation below]
Mental health is at the core of our humanity.
It enables us to lead rich and fulfilling lives and to participate in our communities
But the COVID-19 virus is not only attacking our physical health; it is also increasing psychological suffering.
Grief at the loss of loved ones…
Shock at the loss of jobs…
Isolation and restrictions on movement…
Difficult family dynamics…
Uncertainty and fear for the future…
Mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, are some of the greatest causes of misery in our world.
Throughout my life, and in my own family, I have been close to doctors and psychiatrists treating these conditions. As prime minister of my country, Portugal, and as High Commissioner for Refugees, I became acutely aware of the suffering they cause. This suffering is often exacerbated by stigma and discrimination, which is absolutely unacceptable.
After decades of neglect and underinvestment in mental health services, the COVID-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.
Those most at risk are frontline healthcare workers, older people, adolescents and young people, those with pre-existing mental health conditions and those caught up in conflict and crisis.
We must help them and stand by them.
Even when the pandemic is brought under control, grief, anxiety and depression will continue to affect people and communities.
This is the background to the policy brief on COVID-19 and mental health that we are launching today.
Mental health services are an essential part of all government responses to COVID-19. They must be expanded and fully funded.
Policies must support and care for those affected by mental health conditions, and protect their human rights and dignity. Lockdowns and quarantines must not discriminate against those with poor mental health.
As we recover from the pandemic, we must shift more mental health services to the community, and make sure mental health is included in universal health coverage.
The United Nations is strongly committed to creating a world in which everyone, everywhere, has someone to turn to for psychological support.
I urge governments, civil society, health authorities and others to come together urgently to address the mental health dimension of this pandemic.
And I call on governments in particular to announce ambitious commitments on mental health at the upcoming World Health Assembly. [Ends]

Ang kalusugang pangkaisipan ay nasa pusod ng sangkatauhan.
Pinahihintulutan tayong makapamuhay ng masagana at maykatuparan at makilahok sa ating komunidad
Sinasalakay ng COVID-19 virus hindi lamang ang ating kalusugang pisikal; ito rin ay nagpapatindi ng ating pagdurusang pangkaisipan.
Dalamhating dulot ng pagpanaw ng mga minamahal…
Dagok mula sa pagkawala ng hanapbuhay…
Pag-iisa at paghihigpit sa paggalaw…
Mahirap na pagsasamahan ng pamilya…
Takot at walang katiyakang hinaharap…
Ang mga suliranin sa pagiisip, tulad ng depresiyon at pagkabahala, ay pinagmumulan ng pinakamatinding kahirapan sa mundo.
Sa buong buhay ko, at sa aking pamilya, ako ay naging malapit sa mga manggagamot na nagpapagaling sa mga naturang kundisyon. Bilang prime minister ng Portugal, at High Commissioner for Refugees, nabatid ko ang paghihirap na dulot nito. Pinatitindi ng diskriminasyon at estigma ang pagdurusang ito, at ito ay di katanggap-tanggap.
Matapos ang ilang dekada ng pagpapabaya at kakulangan ng pamumuhanan sa mga serbisyong nakatuon sa pangkalusugang pangkaisipan, ang COVID-19 ay ngayo’y tumatama sa mga pamilya at komunidad na dumaranas ng ng paghihirap na pangkaisipan.
Higit na naaapektuhan ang mga manggagawang pangkalusugan na nasa bungad ng pagtugon sa pandemya, mga nakatatanda, ang kabataan, yaong mayroon nang problema sa pagiisip, at ang mga nasa gitna ng hidwaan at krisis.
Kailangan natin silang ayudahan.
Kahit pa nasawata na ang pandemya, patuloy na mararansan ng mga tao at komunidad ang pagdadalamhati, pagkabahala at depresyon.
Ito ang dahilan kung bakit namin inilalathala ngayon ang policy brief sa COVID-19 at kalusugang pangkaisipan.
Ang serbisyong nakatuon sa kalusugang pangkaisipan ay mahalagang bahagi ng tugon ng pamahalaan sa COVID-19. Kailangan itong palawakin at pondohan.
Kailangang tugunan ng polisiya ang suporta at pagkalinga sa mga naaapektuhan ng kundisyon sa pagiisip, at ang pangangalaga sa kanilang dignidad at karapatang pantao. Kailangang siguraduhin na ang lockdown at kwarantina ay di mag-diskrimina sa mga taong di maigi ang kalusugang pangkaisipan.
Habang tayo ay bumabangon sa pandemya, dapat nating ibaling ang mas maraming serbisyo para sa kalusugang pangkaisipan, at siguraduhing ang kalusugang pangkaisipan ay parte ng universal health coverage.
Ang United Nations ay nangangakong bubuo ng isang mundo kung saan lahat nga tao, sa bawat sulok ng mundo, ay mayroong matatakbuhan para sa ayudang pangkaisipan.
Hinihimok ko ang mga pamahalaan, mga organisasyong sibil, mga nangangasiwa sa kalusugan, at lahat ng iba pa na magtulong-tulong upang pagtuunan ang epekto ng pandemya sa kalusugang pangkaisipan.
Nananawagan ako sa mga pamahalaan na ianunsiyo ang kanilang mga plano patungkol sa kalusugang pangkaisipan sa darating na World Health Assembly. [Nagtatapos]

Title: UN Secretary-General's global appeal to address and counter COVID-19 related hate speech
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
11 May 2020
Download the UN guidance note on addressing and countering COVID-19 related hate speech
COVID-19 does not care who we are, where we live, what we believe or about any other distinction.  We need every ounce of solidarity to tackle it together.  Yet the pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering.
Anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets. Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread, and COVID-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred.  Migrants and refugees have been vilified as a source of the virus -- and then denied access to medical treatment.  With older persons among the most vulnerable, contemptible memes have emerged suggesting they are also the most expendable.  And journalists, whistleblowers, health professionals, aid workers and human rights defenders are being targeted simply for doing their jobs.
We must act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate.  That’s why I’m appealing today for an all-out effort to end hate speech globally.
I call on political leaders to show solidarity with all members of their societies and build and reinforce social cohesion.
I call on educational institutions to focus on digital literacy at a time when billions of young people are online – and when extremists are seeking to prey on captive and potentially despairing audiences.
I call on the media, especially social media companies, to do much more to flag and, in line with international human rights law, remove racist, misogynist and other harmful content.
I call on civil society to strengthen outreach to vulnerable people, and religious actors to serve as models of mutual respect.
And I ask everyone, everywhere, to stand up against hate, treat each other with dignity and take every opportunity to spread kindness.
Last year, I launched the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech to enhance United Nations efforts against this scourge.   As we combat this pandemic, we have a duty to protect people, end stigma and prevent violence.
Let’s defeat hate speech – and COVID-19 - together.

Title: A data-driven revolution for a better future
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
07 May 2020
In a matter of months, over 3 million people have been infected, hundreds of thousands have died, health systems have been overwhelmed, economies decimated, and the social fabric of countries stretched to the point of tearing. But this crisis also presents an unprecedented choice for development—a return to business as usual or a fundamentally alternative future?
The response to this pandemic is arguably the most digitally enabled in history, with innovations supporting disease surveillance, providing information to citizenry, enabling teleworking, facilitating online collaboration and learning, and making social relief payments at immense scale possible. Financial resources are being made available in volumes that dwarf the response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. Lockdowns have taken vehicles off the streets, allowed people to work from home and at the same time care for families, and given people a glimpse of mountains and blue skies they have never been able to see through persistent smog. Some leaders are talking more enthusiastically about planetary health and social well-being as an equal, if not greater, measure of national success than GDP. Covid-19 is leading to unprecedented speed and global collaboration in vaccine and antibody development. Within the span of the last 90 days, nearly 1,700 economic policy announcements on Covid-19 have been made by governments and institutions to ameliorate the worst of the impacts.
Perhaps like no time before we are seeing experimentation at scale and speed. But what works? What are the opportunity costs? What are the differentiated impacts across income groups, the marginalized, the vulnerable, and across different geographic areas? Where do you invest your financial resources—knowing that for each debt dollar spent will be for future generations to repay—to obtain the highest returns measured by planetary health and social well-being as much as growth in GDP? When do you ease lockdowns? Certainly in the Philippines, and likely in most developing countries, existing approaches for monitoring impact and efficacy are piecemeal and certainly not at the scale and granularity required to enable well-informed systemic change. It does not have to be this way. There is an immense amount of administrative and high frequency data available that can be used. There are also honed methods for scraping this data and mature frameworks for structuring it in meaningful ways. We need to converge these frameworks, data streams, data standards, to make better sense and guide an effective response and shape our desired future.
Covid-19, for all its deleterious effects, can provide the stimulus for data collaborations to chart the way forward to the “new normal.” Now is the time to bring together government, industry, social media, non-profits, data scientists and researchers (national and international) under a common platform to collect (and with due regard to data privacy and civil rights), ingest, synthesize, visualize, and analyze, with the aid of artificial intelligence and predictive software, a wide array of data and translate these into evidence-based policies and programs.
Covid-19 is showing us that revolutionary change is possible. We are seeing a tsunami of innovation engulfing us. The sheer magnitude of the crisis is also providing us with the impetus for reflection on the future we need. Data collaborations, enabled by technology can help us accelerate toward a dramatically different, equitable, and sustainable world. If there is indeed a “Covid-19 Dividend,” it is perhaps the opportunity for a data driven revolution for a better future.

Title: UN Secretary-General’s message on the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
24 April 2020
The video message may be viewed here.
The COVID19 pandemic is a tragic reminder of how deeply connected we are. The virus knows no borders and is a quintessential global challenge.  Combatting it requires us to work together as one human family.
We must do all we can to save lives and ease the economic and social devastation.  Crucially, we need to draw the appropriate lessons about the vulnerabilities and inequalities the virus has laid bare, and mobilize investments in education, health systems, social protection and resilience.
This is the biggest international challenge since the Second World War.  Yet even before this test, the world was facing other profound transnational perils – climate change above all.
But multilateralism is not only a matter of confronting shared threats; it is about seizing common opportunities.  We now have the opportunity to build back better than in the past, aiming at inclusive and sustainable economies and societies.
It is not enough to proclaim the virtues of multilateralism; we must continue to show its added value.  International cooperation must adapt to changing times.
We need a networked multilateralism, strengthening coordination among all global multilateral organizations, with regional ones able to make their vital contributions; and an inclusive multilateralism, based on deep interaction with civil society, businesses, local and regional authorities and other stakeholders… where the voice of youth is decisive in shaping our future.
At this key moment for international cooperation, and in this 75th anniversary year of the United Nations, let us strive as one to realize the founders’ vision of a healthy, equitable, peaceful and more sustainable future for all. [Ends]

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks on human rights and COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
23 April 2020
The video message may be viewed here.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency — but it is far more.
It is an economic crisis. A social crisis. And a human crisis that is fast becoming a human rights crisis.
In February, I launched a Call to Action to put human dignity and the promise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the core of our work.
As I said then, human rights cannot be an afterthought in times of crisis — and we now face the biggest international crisis in generations.
Today, I am releasing a report highlighting how human rights can and must guide COVID-19 response and recovery.
The message is clear:  People — and their rights — must be front and centre.
A human rights lens puts everyone in the picture and ensures that no one is left behind.
Human rights responses can help beat the pandemic, putting a focus on the imperative of healthcare for everyone.
But they also serve as an essential warning system — highlighting who is suffering most, why, and what can be done about it.
We have seen how the virus does not discriminate, but its impacts do — exposing deep weaknesses in the delivery of public services and structural inequalities that impede access to them.  We must make sure they are properly addressed in the response.
We see the disproportionate effects on certain communities, the rise of hate speech, the targeting of vulnerable groups, and the risks of heavy-handed security responses undermining the health response.
Against the background of rising ethno-nationalism, populism, authoritarianism and a pushback against human rights in some countries, the crisis can provide a pretext to adopt repressive measures for purposes unrelated to the pandemic.
This is unacceptable.
More than ever, governments must be transparent, responsive and accountable.  Civic space and press freedom are critical.  Civil society organizations and the private sector have essential roles to play.
And in all we do, let’s never forget:  The threat is the virus, not people.
We must ensure that any emergency measures — including states of emergency — are legal, proportionate, necessary and non-discriminatory, have a specific focus and duration, and take the least intrusive approach possible to protect public health.
The best response is one that responds proportionately to immediate threats while protecting human rights and the rule of law.
Looking ahead, we need to build back better.  The Sustainable Development Goals — which are underpinned by human rights — provide the framework for more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies.
Strengthening economic and social rights bolsters resilience for the long haul.
The recovery must also respect the rights of future generations, enhancing climate action aiming at carbon neutrality by 2050 and protecting biodiversity.
We are all in this together.
The virus threatens everyone.  Human rights uplift everyone.
By respecting human rights in this time of crisis, we will build more effective and inclusive solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow. [Ends]

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks on International Mother Earth Day 2020
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
22 April 2020
The video message may be viewed here.
On this International Mother Earth Day, all eyes are on the COVID-19 pandemic – the biggest test the world has faced since the Second World War.
We must work together to save lives, ease suffering and lessen the shattering economic and social consequences.
The impact of the coronavirus is both immediate and dreadful.
But there is another deep emergency -- the planet’s unfolding environmental crisis.
Biodiversity is in steep decline.
Climate disruption is approaching a point of no return.
We must act decisively to protect our planet from both the coronavirus and the existential threat of climate disruption.
The current crisis is an unprecedented wake-up call.
We need to turn the recovery into a real opportunity to do things right for the future.
I am therefore proposing six climate-related actions to shape the recovery and the work ahead.
First: as we spend huge amounts of money to recover from the coronavirus, we must deliver new jobs and businesses through a clean, green transition.
Second: where taxpayers’ money is used to rescue businesses, it needs to  be tied to achieving green jobs and sustainable growth.
Third: fiscal firepower must drive a shift from the grey to green economy, and make societies and people more resilient
Fourth: public funds should be used to invest in the future, not the past, and flow to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and the climate.
Fossil fuel subsidies must end, and polluters must start paying for their pollution
Fifth: climate risks and opportunities must be incorporated into the financial system as well as all aspects of public policy making and infrastructure.
Sixth: we need to work together as an international community.
These six principles constitute an important guide to recovering better together.
Greenhouse gases, just like viruses, do not respect national boundaries.
On this Earth Day, please join me in demanding a healthy and resilient future for people and planet alike. [Ends]

Title: UN Secretary-General’s remarks to media on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on children
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
16 April 2020
The video message may be viewed here
As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across the globe, we are seeing an alarming pattern.
The poorest and most vulnerable members of society are being hardest hit, both by the pandemic and the response.
I am especially concerned about the well-being of the world’s children.
Thankfully, children have so far been largely spared from the most severe symptoms of the disease.
But their lives are being totally upended.
I appeal to families everywhere, and leaders at all levels: protect our children.
Today we are launching a report that highlights the risks they face.
First, education.
Almost all students are now out of school.
Some schools are offering distance learning, but this is not available to all.
Children in countries with slow and expensive Internet services are severely disadvantaged.
Second, food.
A staggering 310 million schoolchildren – nearly half of the world’s total – rely on school for a regular source of daily nutrition.
Even before Covid-19 the world faced unacceptable rates of childhood malnutrition and stunting.
Third, safety.
With children out of school, their communities in lockdown and a global recession biting deeper, family stress levels are rising.
Children are both victims and witnesses of domestic violence and abuse.
With schools closed, an important early warning mechanism is missing.
There is also a danger that girls will drop out of school, leading to an increase in teenage pregnancies.
And we must not ignore the growing risks children are facing as they spend more time online.
This can leave children vulnerable to online sexual exploitation and grooming.
A lack of face-to-face contact with friends and partners may lead to heightened risk-taking such as sending sexualized images.
And increased and unstructured time online may expose children to potentially harmful and violent content as well as greater risk of cyberbullying.
Governments and parents all have a role in keeping children safe.
Social media companies have a special responsibility to protect the vulnerable.
Fourth, health.
Reduced household income will force poor families to cut back on essential health and food expenditures, particularly affecting children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers.
Polio vaccination campaigns have been suspended.
Measles immunization campaigns have stopped in at least 23 countries.
And as health services become overwhelmed, sick children are less able to access care.
With the global recession gathering pace, there could be hundreds of thousands additional child deaths in 2020.
These are just some of the findings of the report we are issuing today.
Its conclusion is clear.
We must act now on each of these threats to our children.
Leaders must do everything in their power to cushion the impact of the pandemic.
What started as a public health emergency has snowballed into a formidable test for the global promise to leave no one behind.
The report urges governments and donors to prioritize education for all children.
It recommends they provide economic assistance, including cash transfers, to low-income families and minimize disruptions to social and healthcare services for children.
We must also prioritize the most vulnerable – children in conflict situations; child refugees and displaced persons; children living with disabilities.
Finally, we must commit to building back better by using the recovery from COVID-19 to pursue a more sustainable and inclusive economy and society in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.
With the pandemic placing so many of the world’s children in jeopardy,
I reiterate my urgent appeal: let us protect our children and safeguard their well-being. [Ends]

Title: UNICEF and Philippines Health Department train 2,500 health workers to help stop COVID-19 spread
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
15 April 2020
MANILA, Philippines – UN children’s agency UNICEF and the Department of Health (DOH) began a virtual training of health workers on COVID-19 Infection Prevention and Control (IPC).
The training, aimed at COVID-19 interventions in home and community settings, was developed in collaboration with DOH, the World Health Organization (WHO) and USAID. The training will build the capacity of up to 2,500 health workers in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao initially. To overcome travel restrictions during the enhanced community quarantine, and to facilitate rapid dissemination, the training is being delivered through a mix of online webinar and offline community platforms for those with limited or no internet access.
The training is consolidated from the Philippine Government, WHO and Centres for Diseases Control (CDC) guidelines. Upon completion of the training, participants will be able to understand the latest information on COVID-19; understand and describe why IPC is important in the context of preparedness, readiness, and response; understand the proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE); describe and demonstrate IPC measures at home and in the community; and understand case definitions and management pathways.
“This excellent collaboration among partners combines scientific approaches and practical solutions to stop the spread of COVID-19 at home and in the community. Guiding us in the development of the training are epidemiologists, nutritionists, public health experts and other specialists who aim to not only stop COVID-19 but also to strengthen the Philippines’ health system in the long term,” UNICEF Philippines Chief of Health and Nutrition Programme Dr. Wigdan Madani says.
The training webinar has so far been an important resource and reliable source of information for communities. “Thank you for the informative presentation you have prepared and presented for us health workers,” comments Zina Gervacio, Sanitary Inspector from the Rural Health Unit of Bongabon, Nueva Ecija.
Apart from health workers, the training can also benefit Barangay Health Workers and Sanitary Inspectors, quarantine officers in the points of entry, border patrol personnel, military, police and barangay members of the COVID-19 task force, Barangay Health Emergency Response Team members, local chief executives such as Governors, Mayors, and Barangay Captains, as well as parents, caregivers and the general public. In particular, specific training modules on cleaning and disinfection protocols for different settings (healthcare facility, community/public spaces, and the home) aim to reach an additional 2,000 local government and health care facility staff. The training will be made available for the public to access through the social media channels of DOH and UNICEF Philippines.
UNICEF supports the Philippine Government in fighting COVID-19 through complementing the government’s response through technical assistance, provision of essential supplies and support for logistics and transportation, effective communication of safe practices to families, as well as ensuring that the rights of children and their families are protected.

Title: UNICEF calls for protection of children under quarantine and children detained
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
14 April 2020
MANILA, Philippines – The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact across the world. In the Philippines, the Government’s efforts to contain the coronavirus are vital to the health of the country’s population, but they are also exposing children to increased risk of violence – including maltreatment, gender-based violence and sexual exploitation.
Movement restrictions, the closure of schools, loss of income, isolation, overcrowding and high levels of stress and anxiety are increasing the likelihood that children experience and observe physical, psychological and sexual abuse at home – particularly those children already living in violent or dysfunctional family situations.
While online communities have become central to maintain many children’s learning, support and play, it is also increasing their exposure to cyberbullying, risky online behavior and sexual exploitation.
Children in detention are also particularly vulnerable during these difficult times. Many are held in confined and over-crowded spaces, conditions that are highly conducive to the spread of diseases like COVID-19. UNICEF urges the Philippine Government to report on the number of children deprived of their liberty or held because of violations of the Enhanced Community Quarantine measures. UNICEF is further recommending to the Philippine Government to align with global guidance to release children in conflict with the law, and immediately adopt and implement guidelines to protect children against COVID- 19 for those whose continuing detention will be required by law.
It can be harder for children to understand the importance of the quarantine and curfew procedures. In the case of violation of curfews, verbal sanctions, such as reprimand and warnings, in addition to explaining the importance of these procedures, to the child and his or her parents/guardians should be sufficient.
The recent release of the Joint Memorandum Circular of the Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) requesting all Local Government Units to promote the rights and best interest of children during the implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine is an excellent measure to protect the most vulnerable during these challenging times.
“In times of emergency, children are already confused and distressed from the fear and anxiety brought by the uncertainty of the spread of disease. We at UNICEF would want to ensure that there is a protective and caring environment for children at all times. We encourage all local government units to implement the recently launched Joint Memorandum Circular that shall protect the best interest of children, by ensuring that they are physically, emotionally, and psychologically protected all the time,” said Patrizia Benvenuti, UNICEF Philippines Chief of Child Protection Section.
UNICEF supports the Philippine Government in fighting COVID-19 by complementing the government’s response through technical assistance, provision of essential supplies, and support for logistics and transportation, effective communication of safe practices to families, as well as ensuring that the rights of children and their families are protected.
For example, initiatives such as the SaferKidsPH campaign addresses online sexual exploitation and abuse of children by raising national awareness of the problem and supporting stronger implementation of laws and policies that protect children. Reports of online child sexual exploitation have increased since the COVID-19 quarantine.

Title: UN Secretary-General’s message for World Health Day
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
07 April 2020
The video message may be viewed here.
World Health Day this year comes at a very difficult time for all of us.
My message today is to our health care workers — the nurses, midwives, technicians, paramedics, pharmacists, doctors, drivers, cleaners, administrators and many others — who work, day and night to keep us safe.
Today, we are more deeply grateful than ever to all of you, as you work, round the clock, putting yourselves at risk, to fight the ravages of this pandemic.
We have all had reason to give thanks for the care and professionalism of nurses and midwives. I know I do.
Nurses shoulder some of the biggest healthcare burdens.  They perform difficult work and endure long hours, while risking injury, infection and the mental health burden that accompanies such traumatic work.  They often provide comfort at the end of life.
Midwives provide comfort at the beginning of life. During a pandemic, their work is even more challenging, as you bring our newborn safely into this world.
To the nurses and midwives of the world: thank you for your work.
In these traumatic times, I say to all healthcare workers: we stand with you and we count on you.
You make us proud; you inspire us. We are indebted to you.
Thank you for the difference you are making, every day and everywhere. [Ends]

Title: "Unang Yakap" and breastfeeding are life-saving for babies in the Philippines
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
06 April 2020
MANILA,  Philippines – The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and World Food Programme (WFP) today called on those involved in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines to emphasize that the most effective way to save newborn lives is still through the practice of Essential Intrapartum and Newborn Care (EINC, or “Unang Yakap”) and the promotion and protection of breastfeeding while strictly following precautions for infection prevention and control.
The estimated 142,000 babies to be born in the country this month need to be with their mothers and start breastfeeding within the first hour of birth. Placing babies in immediate skin-to-skin contact with their mothers keeps babies warm, prevents exposure to surfaces in health facilities that may carry diseases, and helps establish breastfeeding. Babies who drink only their mother’s breastmilk receive antibodies from their mothers, protecting them from potentially deadly infections like pneumonia, diarrhoea and sepsis. In fact, Unang Yakap and exclusive breastfeeding are vital to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. With proper IPC, protection from infection becomes stronger, especially in challenging circumstances and in emergencies.
UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, and WFP prioritize the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding as a life-saving measure for babies everywhere, especially during emergencies, including this COVID-19 outbreak.
“As with all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, symptomatic mothers who are breastfeeding or practicing skin-to-skin contact or kangaroo mother care should observe hand hygiene and basic IPC measures. When performing skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and any activities involving touching or being close to the baby, infected mothers must use a medical mask, wash their hands properly before and after contact with the child, and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces which the mother has touched,” said Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative in the Philippines.
“Every mother needs to be with her baby so she can immediately breastfeed and provide her baby the optimum nutrition to protect him or her from potential deadly infections. We must ensure that the mother receives the right support and guidance on proper infection and prevention control measures,” said Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov, UNICEF Representative in the Philippines.
During emergency situations, the rates of disease and death among babies and children are higher than for any other age group. The younger the child, the higher the risk, leaving babies under six months most vulnerable. Babies who drink formula from an unsterile bottle or teat, or made with unclean water, can become very sick with diarrhoea and die within a few hours. Mortality is particularly high when there is a prevalence of communicable diseases and diarrhoea combined with high rates of undernutrition.
“Appropriate infant and young child feeding - both breastfeeding and complementary feeding - and care are fundamental in preventing malnutrition and mortality among infants and young children. The practice of IPC does not have to conflict with EINC and breastfeeding. In fact, EINC and breastfeeding protect against infection as long as mothers observe the basic steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus and other pathogens,” said Mats Persson, OIC of WFP in the Philippines.
“Maternal, Infant and Young Child Feeding counselling, basic psychosocial support, and practical feeding support should be provided to all pregnant women and mothers with infants and young children, whether they or their infants and young children have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. In addition, all pregnant mothers should have access to a safe birth, antenatal and postnatal care including postpartum family planning, and screening tests according to national guidelines, especially in areas with high numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases where access to services for pregnant women, women in labour and delivery, and lactating women is negatively impacted,” said Iori Kato, UNFPA Representative in the Philippines.
The UN Agencies strongly urge the Department of Health, public health and clinical experts, professional societies, and all involved in guideline and policy development, funding, planning, and implementing the emergency response in the Philippines to avoid unnecessary illness and death by ensuring that  EINC and breastfeeding are not sacrificed while preventing the spread of infection. Community leaders are called upon to practice IPC in all settings and recognize the benefits of Unang Yakap and breastfeeding. Community leaders are enjoined to create or strengthen networks for mothers to receive safe delivery care, and to monitor and report any donations by all breastmilk substitute or infant formula manufacturers and all groups that may undermine breastfeeding.

Title: UN Secretary-General’s statement on gender-based violence and COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
05 April 2020
The video message may be viewed here.
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing untold human suffering and economic devastation around the world.
I recently called for an immediate global ceasefire to focus on our shared struggle to overcome the pandemic.
I appealed for an end to violence everywhere, now.
But violence is not confined to the battlefield.
For many women and girls, the threat looms largest where they should be safest.
In their own homes.
And so I make a new appeal today for peace at home — and in homes — around the world.
We know lockdowns and quarantines are essential to suppressing COVID-19. But they can trap women with abusive partners.
Over the past weeks as economic and social pressures and fear have grown, we have seen a horrifying global surge in domestic violence.
In some countries, the number of women calling support services has doubled.
Meanwhile, healthcare providers and police are overwhelmed and understaffed.
Local support groups are paralyzed or short of funds. Some domestic violence shelters are closed; others are full.
I urge all governments to make the prevention and redress of violence against women a key part of their national response plans for COVID-19.
That means increasing investment in online services and civil society organizations.
Making sure judicial systems continue to prosecute abusers.
Setting up emergency warning systems in pharmacies and groceries.
Declaring shelters as essential services.
And creating safe ways for women to seek support, without alerting their abusers.
Women’s rights and freedoms are essential to strong, resilient societies.
Together, we can and must prevent violence everywhere, from war zones to people’s homes, as we work to beat COVID-19. [Ends]

Title: All hands on deck to fight a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
03 April 2020
Only by coming together will the world be able to face down the COVID-19 pandemic and its shattering consequences. At an emergency virtual meeting last Thursday, G20 leaders took steps in the right direction.  But we are still far away from having a coordinated, articulated global response that meets the unprecedented magnitude of what we are facing.
Far from flattening the curve of infection, we are still well behind it.  The disease initially took 67 days to infect 100,000 people; soon, 100,000 people and more will be infected daily.  Without concerted and courageous action, the number of new cases will almost certainly escalate into the millions, pushing health systems to the breaking point, economies into a nosedive and people into despair, with the poorest hit hardest.
We must prepare for the worst and do everything to avoid it.  Here is a three-point call to action — based on science, solidarity and smart policies — for doing just that.
First, suppress transmission of the coronavirus.
That requires aggressive and early testing and contact tracing, complemented by quarantines, treatment, and measures to keep first responders safe, combined with measures to restrict movement and contact.  Such steps, despite the disruptions they cause, must be sustained until therapies and a vaccine emerge.
Crucially, this robust and cooperative effort should be guided by the World Health Organization, a member of the United Nations family; countries acting on their own – as they must for their people – will not get the job done for all.
Second, tackle the devastating social and economic dimensions of the crisis.
The virus is spreading like wildfire, and is likely to move swiftly into the Global South, where health systems face constraints, people are more vulnerable, and millions live in densely populated slums or crowded settlements for refugees and internally displaced persons.  Fuelled by such conditions, the virus could devastate the developing world and then re-emerge where it was previously suppressed.  In our interconnected world, we are only as strong as the weakest health systems.
Clearly, we must fight the virus for all of humanity, with a focus on people, especially the most affected: women, older persons, youth, low-wage workers, small and medium enterprises, the informal sector and vulnerable groups.
The United Nations has just issued reports documenting how the viral contagion has become an economic contagion, and setting out the financing needed to address the shocks.  The International Monetary Fund has declared that we have entered a recession as bad as or worse than in 2009.
We need a comprehensive multilateral response amounting to a double-digit percentage of global Gross Domestic Product.
Developed countries can do it by themselves, and some are indeed doing it.  But we must massively increase the resources available to the developing world by expanding the capacity of the IMF, namely through the issuance of special drawing rights, and of the other international financial institutions so that they can rapidly inject resources into the countries that need them.  I know this is difficult as nations find themselves increasing domestic spending by record amounts.  But that spending will be in vain if we don’t control the virus.
Coordinated swaps among central banks can also bring liquidity to emerging economies.  Debt alleviation must also be a priority – including immediate waivers on interest payments for 2020.
Third, recover better.
We simply cannot return to where we were before COVID-19 struck, with societies unnecessarily vulnerable to crisis.  The pandemic has reminded us, in the starkest way possible, of the price we pay for weaknesses in health systems, social protections and public services.  It has underscored and exacerbated inequalities, above all gender inequity, laying bare the way in which the formal economy has been sustained on the back of invisible and unpaid care labour.  It has highlighted ongoing human rights challenges, including stigma and violence against women.
Now is the time to redouble our efforts to build more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change and other global challenges.  The recovery must lead to a different economy.  Our roadmap remains the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals.
The United Nations system is fully mobilized: supporting country responses, placing our supply chains at the world’s disposal, and advocating for a global cease-fire.
Ending the pandemic everywhere is both a moral imperative and a matter of enlightened self-interest.  At this unusual moment, we cannot resort to the usual tools.  Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.  We face a colossal test which demands decisive, coordinated and innovative action from all, for all.

Title: UN Secretary-General's remarks at launch of report on the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
31 March 2020
The world is facing an unprecedented test.  And this is the moment of truth.
Hundreds of thousands of people are falling seriously ill from COVID-19, and the disease is spreading exponentially in many places,
Societies are in turmoil and economies are in a nose-dive.
The International Monetary Fund has reassessed the prospect for growth for 2020 and 2021, declaring that we have entered a recession – as bad as or worse than in 2009.
We must respond decisively, innovatively and together to suppress the spread of the virus and address the socio-economic devastation that COVID-19 is causing in all regions.
The magnitude of the response must match the scale of the crisis — large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive, with country and international responses being guided by the World Health Organization.
And it must be multilateral, with countries showing solidarity to the most vulnerable communities and nations.
The message of the report we are issuing today is clear: shared responsibility and global solidarity in response to the impacts of COVID-19.
It is a call to action.
First, for an immediate coordinated health response to suppress transmission and end the pandemic.
A response that scales up health capacity for testing, tracing, quarantine and treatment, while keeping first responders safe, combined with measures to restrict movement and contact.
A response that delivers universal access to treatment and vaccines, when they are ready.
It is essential that developed countries immediately assist those less developed to bolster their health systems and their response capacity to stop transmission.
Otherwise we face the nightmare of the disease spreading like wildfire in the global South with millions of deaths and the prospect of the disease re-emerging where it was previously suppressed.
Let us remember that we are only as strong as the weakest health system in our interconnected world.
I am particularly concerned with the African continent, and I strongly encourage the G20 to move ahead with a G20 Africa initiative as proposed at the Summit.
Second, we must tackle the devastating social and economic dimensions of this crisis, with a focus on the most affected: women, older persons, youth, low-wage workers, small and medium enterprises, the informal sector and vulnerable groups, especially those in humanitarian and conflict settings.
We must see countries not only united to beat the virus but also to tackle its profound consequences.
That means designing fiscal and monetary policies able to support the direct provision of resources to support workers and households, the provision of health and unemployment insurance, scaled up social protection, and support to businesses to prevent bankruptcies and massive job losses.
What is needed is a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10 per cent of global GDP.
Developed countries can do it by themselves, and some are indeed doing so.
But we must massively increase the resources available to the developing world by expanding the capacity of the International Monetary Fund, namely through the issuance of special drawing rights, and the other international financial institutions to rapidly inject resources into the countries that need them.
Coordinated swaps among central banks can also bring liquidity to emerging economies.
Debt alleviation must be a priority – including immediate waivers on interest payments for 2020.
The United Nations system is fully mobilized, providing guidance for global efforts, supporting country responses and placing our supply chains at the world’s disposal.
And to support our efforts, the United Nations is establishing a new multi-partner Trust Fund for COVID19 Response and Recovery to support low- and middle-income countries to respond to the emergency and recover from the socio-economic shock.
UN Resident Coordinators worldwide will be the drivers of the UN response on the ground, ensuring that the wide and diverse expertise and assets of the United Nations system are used in the most efficient and effective way to support countries.
Finally, when we get past this crisis — which we will — we will face a choice.
We can go back to the world as it was before or deal decisively with those issues that make us all unnecessarily vulnerable to crises.
Our roadmap is the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis must lead to a different economy.
Everything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.
What the world needs now is solidarity.
With solidarity we can defeat the virus and build a better world.
Thank you. [Ends]

Title: Critical work of UN ‘largely uninterrupted’, despite unprecedented challenge of COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
27 March 2020
“Although we are not sitting together, be rest assured that we are in this together”, said Tijjani Muhammad Bande, United Nations General Assembly President. “We must lead by example. We must stay at home, abide by social distancing recommendations, wash our hands, and look out for one another”.
Mr. Bande reported that thanks to technology, the General Assembly’s Fifth Committee was able to make important budget decisions during this time.
He said countries must not only defeat the new coronavirus: they also have to mitigate its social and economic impacts, stating that “we need to galvanise multilateral action now to protect gains made towards the eradication of poverty and zero hunger, as this crisis puts a strain on food production and supply chains, among others”.
Changes at the Security Council
The UN Security Council has had to change its working methods due to the pandemic.
Ambassador Zhang Jun of China, Council President for March, reported that despite difficulties, members have been holding meetings by video teleconference.
“We know that Member States are very much keen to know what’s happening in the Security Council. What’s true is that the new situation does create a lot of difficulties through maintaining transparency, but we are working very hard on that”, he said.
So far, the Council agenda has included “hotspot issues” such as the situations in Libya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Members have also issued statements condemning deadly attacks in Afghanistan and against peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. They are also set to act soon on several draft resolutions.
Development gains under threat
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), which is at the heart of the UN’s work in advancing sustainable development, has not stopped working, President Mona Juul told countries.
However, she warned of the pandemic’s threat to development gains, particularly in the world’s most vulnerable countries, while the need for humanitarian relief is urgent.
“Beyond immediate humanitarian aid, developing countries will need support to lessen the overall socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. In this, the UN must play a key role”, said Ms. Juul.
“We need joint UN efforts to assist developing countries in their recovery and in building more resilient health systems”.
As response will require substantial financing, she welcomed recent announcements on economic support by G-20 countries, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
Communications for solidarity
The UN Secretary-General participated in the G-20 virtual summit on Thursday, where he pressed for collective action and financial support to stop the virus and minimize its impact.
António Guterres updated Member States on measures taken to protect UN staff globally as they execute the Organization’s mandates, underlining that “our critical work is continuing largely uninterrupted”.
“Our Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams are on the frontlines”, he said. As of last week, 93 per cent of teams, reported “being engaged with national authorities in preparing preparedness and response plans.”
The UN chief urged countries to support initiatives announced this week, such as his appeal for a global ceasefire, a humanitarian response fund for the world’s poorest countries, and a call to stand against increasing hate crimes targeting people perceived to be associated with spreading the coronavirus.
He also announced the launch of a communications strategy aimed at fighting misinformation around the pandemic.
The COVID-19 Communications for Solidarity Initiative will inform the global public and promote and inspire acts of humanity around the world. [Ends]

Title: UN Secretary-General’s remarks at launch of Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
25 March 2020
The world faces an unprecedented threat.
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly covered the globe. It has spread suffering, disrupted billions of lives and endangered the global economy.
COVID-19 is menacing the whole of humanity – and so the whole of humanity must fight back. Individual country responses are not going to be enough.
Wealthy countries with strong health systems are buckling under the pressure.
Now, the virus is arriving in countries already in the midst of humanitarian crises caused by conflicts, natural disasters and climate change.
These are places where people who have been forced to flee their homes because of bombs, violence or floods are living under plastic sheets in fields, or crammed into refugee camps or informal settlements.
They do not have homes in which to socially distance or self-isolate.
They lack clean water and soap with which to do that most basic act of self-protection against the virus – washing their hands.
And should they become critically ill, they have no way of accessing a healthcare system that can provide a hospital bed and a ventilator.
We must come to the aid of the ultra-vulnerable – millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves.
This is a matter of basic human solidarity.
It is also crucial for combatting the virus.
The world is only as strong as our weakest health system. If we do not act decisively now, I fear the virus will establish a foothold in the most fragile countries, leaving the whole world vulnerable as it continues to circle the planet, paying no mind to borders.
This is the moment to step up for the vulnerable.
Older persons, persons with chronic illness and persons with disabilities face particular, disproportionate risks, and require an all-out effort to save their lives and protect their future.
We are also aware of the heavy impact the crisis is having on the world’s women across many fronts, in particular losses of livelihood, increased burdens of unpaid care labour, and the heightened exposure to domestic violence.
Today we are launching a $2 billion global humanitarian response plan to fund the fight against COVID-19 in the world’s poorest countries.
Coordinated by the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, this interagency plan brings together existing appeals from the World Health Organization and other UN partners, and identifies new needs as well.
Properly funded, it will save many lives and arm humanitarian agencies and NGOs with laboratory supplies for testing, and with medical equipment to treat the sick while protecting health care workers.
The plan also includes additional measures to support host communities that continue to generously open their homes and towns to refugees and displaced persons.
We need to act now to stem the impact of COVID-19 in already vulnerable humanitarian contexts.
And we need to maintain support for existing humanitarian response plans on which 100 million people depend.
If such funding is diverted, the consequences could be catastrophic: the further spread of cholera, measles and meningitis; greater levels of child malnutrition; and a blow to the ability of these countries to combat the virus.
Let us do everything we can to prevent COVID-19 from wreaking havoc in places with limited healthcare capacity and resilience.
At the same time, we are doing our utmost to plan for and respond to early recovery in the countries around the globe that will need it most so that we achieve a new sustainable and inclusive economy that leaves no-one behind. I have asked United Nations Resident Coordinators and UN Country Teams to support countries around the world in addressing the socio-economic implications of this pandemic, [which] will require an adequate funding mechanism.
But now we need to support this humanitarian response plan, which is a necessity for global health security.
It is a moral imperative and in everyone’s interests.
And it is a crucial part of winning this fight.
I appeal to Governments to give it their full support.
Thank you. [Ends]

Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
25 March 2020
The video message may be viewed here.
Our world faces a common enemy: COVID-19.
The virus does not care about nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith.  It attacks all, relentlessly.
Meanwhile, armed conflict rages on around the world.
The most vulnerable — women and children, people with disabilities, the marginalized and the displaced — pay the highest price.
They are also at the highest risk of suffering devastating losses from COVID-19.
Let’s not forget that in war-ravaged countries, health systems have collapsed.
Health professionals, already few in number, have often been targeted.
Refugees and others displaced by violent conflict are doubly vulnerable.
The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war.
That is why today, I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world.
It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives.
To warring parties, I say:
Pull back from hostilities.
Put aside mistrust and animosity.
Silence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes.
This is crucial…
To help create corridors for life-saving aid.
To open precious windows for diplomacy.
To bring hope to places among the most vulnerable to COVID-19.
Let us take inspiration from coalitions and dialogue slowly taking shape among rival parties to enable joint approaches to COVID-19.  But we need much more.
End the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world.
It starts by stopping the fighting everywhere. Now.
That is what our human family needs, now more than ever. [Ends]

Title: UNICEF supports protection of children during enhanced community quarantine
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
23 March 2020
MANILA, Philippines – In line with efforts to stop the transmission of COVID-19 and the implementation of enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and other parts of the country, UNICEF continues to support the Philippine government in encouraging children, parents, and caregivers to ensure the protection of the rights of children against violence, neglect, and abuse during these challenging situation.
While efforts to contain the virus understandably requires restrictive measures, UNICEF emphasizes that these measures should always be in the best interest of the child; should do no further harm; and always consider the preservation of the child’s welfare and dignity.
“In times of emergency, children are already confused and distressed from the fear and anxiety brought by the uncertainty of the spread of disease. We, at UNICEF, would want to ensure that there is a protective and caring environment for children at all times. We encourage the government to apply child friendly protocols in the implementation of community quarantine and ensure that all measures taken to protect children respond to their best interest,” said Patrizia Benvenuti, Chief of Child Protection of UNICEF Philippines.
UNICEF supports the Philippine Government in fighting COVID-19 through essential supplies, and support for logistics and transportation and the development of communication materials, as well as ensuring that the rights of children and their families are protected. UNICEF and its partners urge government officials to:

Title: UN Secretary-General’s remarks at G20 virtual summit on the COVID-19 pandemic
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 March 2020
We are at war with a virus – and not winning it.
It took the world three months to reach 100,000 confirmed cases of infection.
The next 100,000 happened in just 12 days.
The third took four days.
The fourth, just one and a half.
This is exponential growth and only the tip of the iceberg.
This war needs a war-time plan to fight it.
Solidarity is essential. Among the G-20 – and with the developing world, including countries in conflict.
That is why I appealed for a global ceasefire.
Allow me to highlight three critical areas for concerted G-20 action.
First, to suppress the transmission of COVID-19 as quickly as possible.
That must be our common strategy.
It requires a coordinated G-20 response mechanism guided by WHO.
All countries must be able to combine systematic testing, tracing, quarantining and treatment with restrictions on movement and contact – aiming to suppress transmission of the virus.
And they have to coordinate the exit strategy to keep it suppressed until a vaccine becomes available.
At the same time, we need massive support to increase the response capacity of developing countries.
The United Nations system has a well-established supply chain network, and we stand ready to place it at your disposal.
Second, we must work together to minimize the social and economic impact.
The G-20 came of age in the 2008 financial crisis.
The challenges before us dwarf those of 2008.
And what we face today is not a banking crisis; it is a human crisis.
While the liquidity of the financial system must be assured, our emphasis must be on the human dimension.
We need to concentrate on people, keeping households afloat and businesses solvent, able to protect jobs.
This will require a global response reaching double-digit percentages of the global economy.
I welcome infusions of liquidity and social and economic support in developed countries — with direct transfer of resources to people and businesses.
But a stimulus package to help developing countries with the same objectives also requires a massive investment.
For this, we need greater resources for the International Monetary Fund and other International Financial Institutions, a meaningful emission of Special Drawing Rights, coordinated swaps between central banks and steps to alleviate debt, such as a waiver of interest payments.
I also appeal for the waving of sanctions that can undermine countries’ capacity to respond to the pandemic.
Third, we must work together now to set the stage for a recovery that builds a more sustainable, inclusive and equitable economy, guided by our shared promise — the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Title: UNFPA supports Philippine health workers through PPE donation
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
18 March 2020
MANILA, Philippines – To augment the ongoing response by the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) to the rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreak in the country, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in the Philippines is donating personal protective equipment (PPE) worth more than three million pesos (approximately USD 59,000) to the DOH, in the midst of the “enhanced community quarantine” all across Luzon including Metro Manila. This PPE will be distributed to frontline health workers including those attending to pregnant and lactating women.
As the first cases of COVID-19 local transmission were confirmed, on 8 March 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte declared a State of a Public Health Emergency. As of 18 March, the number of confirmed cases in the country has risen to 202 with 17 deaths.   As the numbers of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 are rapidly increasing in the country and more people are in need of testing and treatment, it adds to pressure on the health sector and the nature of the jobs of the health care workers puts them at an increased risk of catching any communicable diseases, including COVID-19.  Dozens of health care workers have already been put under investigation for potential COVID-19 infection. If the number of health care workers who need to take leave of absence increases, it further amplifies the strain on the already stretched health care system.
The PPE that the UNFPA Country Representative in the Philippines, Mr. Iori Kato, handed over to Undersecretary Dr. Myrna Cabotaje and Undersecretary Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire today at the DOH includes coveralls, long-sleeve gowns, face shields, eye goggles, aprons, headcovers, and shoe covers. Also present is Director Mar Wynn Bello during the handover.  “It is imperative that we support DOH and all the heroes of this country today – all the people working in the health sector, especially the front liners, risk their health and safety to respond to this emergency. They need to be protected from infection,” underscored UNFPA Philippines Chief of Health, Dr. Joseph Michael Singh.
UNFPA previously donated 1,130 pieces of hand-held thermometers worth more than 3 million Pesos to the DOH on 26 February, for regularly monitoring the temperature and possible symptoms of the almost 500 Filipino passengers and staff who returned from the MV Diamond Princess, in a way that minimizes the exposure of the country’s health workers. In addition, UNFPA also donated 100,000 pieces of surgical masks of almost 3 million Pesos to the DOH on 11 March for the protection of frontline health workers especially those attending to pregnant women at maternity wards.
“To date, there is no scientific evidence about the increased susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19. However, pregnancy brings physical changes that might make some pregnant women more susceptible to viral respiratory infections. Pregnant women with respiratory illnesses must be treated with the utmost priority due to increased risk of adverse outcomes,” stated Dr. Natalia Kanem, UN Under-Secretary-General and UNFPA Executive Director, in UNFPA’s global statement on the emergency.  As pregnant women require more regular visits to hospitals and clinics, infection control in maternity settings must be prioritized.  Infection control starts with ensuring that health workers are adequately protected.
Ms. Aimee Santos, UNFPA Chief of Gender in the Philippines, pointed also to the  ‘gendered’ aspects of the pandemic. “The existing gender inequality can be worsened in a crisis like this.  Previous cases of epidemics like the Ebola outbreak show evidence of increased exploitation and abuse of women and girls. And all these survivors need to access protection and health services even in the midst of community quarantines.”
“At this most trying time, our strongest weapon as a nation is Vigilance, Preparedness, and Solidarity,” Health Secretary Dr. Francisco Duque III said in an earlier statement.  UNFPA Country Representative Mr. Kato responded, “We would like to express our solidarity with all Filipinos as we face the COVID-19 pandemic together. Alongside WHO, all UN agencies including UNFPA stand ready to provide any assistance we could to support the national response to this pandemic.”

Title: UN Secretary-General’s message on Covid-19
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
14 March 2020

The video message may be viewed here.
The upheaval caused by the coronavirus – COVID 19 — is all around us.
And I know many are anxious, worried and confused.
That’s absolutely natural.
We are facing a health threat unlike any other in our lifetimes.
Meanwhile, the virus is spreading … the danger is growing … and our health systems, economies and day-to-day lives are being severely tested.
The most vulnerable are the most affected — particularly our elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions … those without access to reliable health care … and those in poverty or living on the edge.
The social and economic fallout from the combination of the pandemic and slowing economies will affect most of us for some months.
But the spread of the virus will peak.  Our economies will recover.
Until then, we must act together to slow the spread of the virus and look after each other.
This is a time for prudence, not panic. Science, not stigma.  Facts, not fear.
Even though the situation has been classified as a pandemic, it is one we can control.
We can slow down transmissions, prevent infections and save lives.
But that will take unprecedented personal, national and international action.
We must declare war on this virus.
That means countries have a responsibility to gear up, step up and scale up.
By implementing effective containment strategies.
By activating and enhancing emergency response systems.
By dramatically increasing testing capacity and care for patients.
By readying hospitals, ensuring they have the space, supplies and needed personnel.
And by developing life-saving medical interventions.
And all of us have a responsibility, too.
To follow medical advice and take simple, practical steps recommended by health authorities.
In addition to being a public health crisis, the virus is infecting the global economy.
Financial markets have been hard hit by the uncertainty.
Global supply chains have been disrupted.
Investment and consumer demand have plunged — with a real and rising risk of a global recession.
United Nations economists estimate that the virus could cost the global economy at least $1 trillion this year – and perhaps more.
No country can do it alone.
More than ever, governments must cooperate to revitalize economies … expand public investment … boost trade … and ensure targeted support for the people and communities most affected by the disease or more vulnerable to the negative economic impacts – including women who often shoulder a disproportionate burden of care work.
Dear Friends,
A pandemic drives home the essential interconnectedness of our human family.
Preventing the further spread of COVID-19 is a shared responsibility for us all.
The United Nations – including the World Health Organization — is fully mobilized.
As part of our human family, we are working 24/7 with governments, providing international guidance, helping the world take on this threat.
We stand in full solidarity with you.
We are in this together – and we will get through this, together.
Thank you. [Ends]

Title: UNODC puts gender at center of SE Asia law enforcement dialogue
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
21 January 2020
PHU QUOC, Vietnam - Ten maritime law enforcement practitioners from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, together with six international gender experts and contributors, attended the special session to the 7 th Maritime Law Enforcement Dialogue (MLED) in Southeast Asia, titled "Women in Maritime Law Enforcement" (WMLE).
The event took place in the island of Phu Quoc, Vietnam, where country representatives from law enforcement agencies (coast guards, marine police, etc.) exchanged valuable ideas and experiences on the linkages between gender and law enforcement in the maritime domain. This event is part of the UNODC's Global Maritime Crime Programme (GMCP)-led series of MLEDs, aimed at facilitating and improving cooperation and collaboration between maritime law enforcement agencies in Southeast Asian states.
Given that both the law enforcement sphere and the maritime space have been traditionally regarded as occupied by men or as "masculine" domains, women in MLE face challenges in accessing and/or remaining in the field. In order to address this, the MLED brought expertise from various agencies and organizations, including the Senegalese National Agency for Maritime Affairs, INTERPOL's Maritime Security Unit, UNODC's Container Control Programme and UN Women.
Siri Bjune, GMCP's Programme Officer, stated that "UNODC and other agencies of the United Nations are committed to increasing women's engagement, participation and empowerment towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, Gender Equality, in all spheres. Maritime law enforcement is not the exception. We believe that the best way forward is bringing women themselves to raise their concerns, discuss diverse approaches and act together. The MLED provides a unique scenario for these exchanges to take place."
Some of the key challenges identified during the Dialogue highlighted that women in MLE experience tokenism, discrimination and self-discrimination, cultural and societal prejudice based on gender roles and lack of inclusive infrastructure (i.e. washrooms for women at port or on vessels). To overcome this, participants suggested potential solutions, which included increasing career opportunities for women in MLE through education, awareness-raising and promotion of positive role models, and capacity- and self-confidence-building initiatives for women in the field. Participants stated that, for these strategies to be achieved, supportive policy, legal and institutional frameworks seeking to achieve gender equality must be put in place. This would be reinforced by encouraging the enactment of WMLE networks at the national level and increasing participation at the regional level.
The event, which was held from 28 to 29 November 2019, concluded with a series of commitments to tackle these challenges in each represented country, and a way forward on the establishment of a Southeast Asian WMLE network.

Title: Insufficient paid work affects almost half a billion people, new ILO report shows
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
20 January 2020
GENEVA  – Almost half a billion people are working fewer paid hours than they would like or lack adequate access to paid work, according to a new International Labour Organization (ILO) report.

In addition, the World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2020  (WESO) shows that unemployment is projected to increase by around 2.5 million in 2020. Global unemployment has been roughly stable for the last nine years but slowing global economic growth means that, as the global labour force increases, not enough new jobs are being generated to absorb new entrants to the labour market.

“For millions of ordinary people, it’s increasingly difficult to build better lives through work,” said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. “Persisting and substantial work-related inequalities and exclusion are preventing them from finding decent work and better futures. That’s an extremely serious finding that has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion.”
“For millions of ordinary people, it’s increasingly difficult to build better lives through work."-- Guy Ryder, ILO Director-General
The WESO shows that the mismatch between labour supply and demand extends beyond unemployment into broader labour underutilization. In addition to the global number of unemployed (188 million), 165 million people don’t have enough paid work and 120 million have either given up actively searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labour market. In total, more than 470 million people worldwide are affected.

It also looks at labour market inequalities. Using new data and estimates it shows that, at the global level, income inequality is higher than previously thought, especially in developing countries.

Worldwide, the share of national income going to labour (rather than to other factors of production) declined substantially between 2004 and 2017, from 54 per cent to 51 per cent, with this economically significant fall being most pronounced in Europe, Central Asia and the Americas. This is more than suggested by previous estimates, the WESO shows.

Moderate or extreme working poverty is expected to edge up in 2020-21 in developing countries, increasing the obstacles to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1  on eradicating poverty everywhere by 2030. Currently working poverty (defined as earning less than US$3.20 per day in purchasing power parity terms) affects more than 630 million workers, or one in five of the global working population.

Other significant inequalities – defined by gender, age and geographic location - remain stubborn features of current labour markets, the report shows, limiting both individual opportunities and general economic growth. In particular, a staggering 267 million young people (aged 15-24) are not in employment, education or training, and many more endure substandard working conditions.
“We will only find a sustainable, inclusive path of development if we tackle these kinds of labour market inequalities and gaps in access to decent work." -- Stefan Kühn, WESO 2020 lead author
The report cautions that intensifying trade restrictions and protectionism could have a significant impact on employment, both directly and indirectly.

Looking at economic growth, it finds that the current pace and form of growth is hampering efforts to reduce poverty and improve working conditions in low-income countries. The WESO recommends that the type of growth needs to shift to encourage higher-value added activities, through structural transformation, technological upgrading and diversification.

“Labour underutilization and poor-quality jobs mean our economies and societies are missing out on the potential benefits of a huge pool of human talent,” said the report’s lead author, Stefan Kühn. “We will only find a sustainable, inclusive path of development if we tackle these kinds of labour market inequalities and gaps in access to decent work.”

The annual WESO Trends report analyses key labour market issues, including unemployment, labour underutilisation, working poverty, income inequality, labour income share and factors that exclude people from decent work.

Title: 488,000 children in Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi receive polio protection
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
08 January 2020
COTABATO CITY, Philippines — The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) continue their support to the Department of Health (DOH) in the remote islands of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi (BaSulTa) to reach 488,000 targeted children under 10 years old with the polio vaccine.
Children in BaSulTa are at risk of infection from polio because of low vaccination coverage, inaccessibility, and security issues in the island municipalities and barangays. To offer added protection to children in BaSulTa, one of the priority areas, a further three rounds of immunisation for poliovirus type 1 targeting all children below ten years old will be implemented. The immunisation schedules include January 6 to 12 for BaSulTa and Zamboanga City, and Mindanao-wide for January 20 to February 2, February 17 to March 1, and March 23 to April 4, 2020.
DOH announced a polio outbreak in the Philippines last September 19, 2019, with the first type 2 poliovirus case found in Marogong, Lanao del Sur. On November 26, DOH announced the re-emergence of type 1 poliovirus in Maluso, Basilan. On December 6, the first case of polio after 27 years was confirmed in Sabah, Malaysia, and revealed to have genetic links to the polio case found in Basilan.
Lessons learned from the previous vaccination rounds in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) revealed that local government units need additional help, especially those in hard-to-reach areas. The DOH is working with the Bangsamoro government and local government units for the implementation of the polio campaign with technical support from the WHO, UNICEF and other partners.
“WHO recognizes that DOH and local government units have been working tirelessly during the holidays to prepare for this response. The high-level political support has been instrumental in the success we witnessed in the previous rounds, and urge all parties to ensure high coverage during this campaign to ensure that all the vulnerable children in these islands will receive the much-needed protection,” says Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative to the Philippines.
“UNICEF is concerned about the plight of children in BaSulTa and the rest of children in BARMM. They are among the most vulnerable children in the Philippines. Vaccination is the only way to protect children from polio. Vaccines are safe and effective. We must all work hand in hand to stop the spread of the virus,” Andrew Morris, UNICEF Chief of Mindanao Field Office, says.
WHO has been supporting DOH and Ministry of Health BARMM in responding to the polio outbreak by deploying personnel to ensure that vaccination campaigns are planned and implemented effectively. WHO also continues to provide financial support and technical advice on intensifying acute flaccid paralysis and environmental surveillance, and on risk communication, aimed at finally strengthening routine immunization programme in the country.
For the polio response, UNICEF assisted health workers before, during and after each campaign. Before each campaign, UNICEF helped the government procure supplies such as vaccines, freezers, ice packs, and vaccine carriers; facilitated the social mobilization component of the program, enjoining civil society, religious leaders and other influencers to spread messages about polio prevention; and lead the microplanning process with each municipality to ensure each child is reached. During the campaign, UNICEF staff provided technical assistance to overcome challenges in the field. After each campaign, UNICEF staff complemented the DOH’s effort in the conduct of assessments in select barangays to check if any child is missed. UNICEF also provided assistance for proper vaccine disposal.
Immunisation is the most effective way to protect children from polio and stop the spread of the virus. WHO and UNICEF call on parents and caregivers to have their children vaccinated during synchronised polio vaccination rounds in priority areas announced by DOH.

Title: World gathering on refugees opens in Geneva after ‘decade of displacement’
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
16 December 2019
GENEVA, BANGKOK -- A three-day global gathering aimed at transforming the way the world responds to refugee situations starts today in Geneva, Switzerland.
The first-ever Global Refugee Forum brings together refugees, heads of state and government, UN leaders, international institutions, development organizations, business leaders and civil society representatives, among others, at the Palais des Nations, the home of the United Nations Office in Geneva.
UNHCR is co-hosting the Forum together with Switzerland, and it is being co-convened by Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan, and Turkey. The aim of the Forum is to generate new approaches and long-term commitments from a variety of actors to help refugees and the communities in which they live. Worldwide, over 70 million people are displaced by war, conflict, and persecution. More than 25 million of them are refugees, having fled across international borders and unable to return to their homes.
In Asia, there are 4.2 million refugees, 2.7 million internally displaced people (IDPs) and 2.2 million stateless people. This totals 9.5 million people who are in critical need of the solidarity, enhanced responsibility-sharing and practical commitments towards solutions being stimulated by the Forum.
Afghans remain the largest and longest displaced refugee population in the region. Today, four decades since their initial displacement, there are over 2.7 million registered Afghan refugees, the vast majority of whom have been hosted by the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan. It is imperative to mobilize stronger international action to lessen the burden on host communities and to find solutions for this long-standing refugee situation. To this end, on the eve of the Forum, the governments of the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan came together with UNHCR today to launch the Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees (SSAR). The platform will serve to enhance coordination and partnerships for the Afghan crisis and to ensure that humanitarian and development efforts go hand in hand.
Asia is also home to the stateless Rohingya population from Myanmar, approximately 745,000 of whom fled to Bangladesh in 2017. The Rohingya refugee population in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, currently numbers some 900,000 people. Solutions to this crisis remains elusive; robust engagement and support is required to help ensure that these men, women and children do not end up spending generations in exile.
“We are emerging from a decade of displacement during which refugee numbers have surged,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.
“This week, at the first ever Global Refugee Forum, we must focus our efforts in the coming decade on building upon what we have learned and committing action to support refugees and the countries and communities hosting them. This Forum is an opportunity to attest our collective commitment to the Global Compact on Refugees and rally behind the aspirations of the Sustainable Development Goals of leaving no one behind.”
The Global Compact on Refugees paves the way for everyone to take responsibility and play a role, including all levels of government, the private sector, development agencies and financial institutions, civil society, faith groups, and refugees themselves.
The contributions made at the Forum are expected to include financial, technical, and material assistance; legal and policy changes to enable greater inclusion of refugees in society; resettlement places, and the safe return for refugees as part of solutions.
“We need more help like this,” said Joelle Hangi from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who is one of the Forum’s refugee co-sponsors.
“Already there are many examples of cooperation – but with refugee numbers rising, we need more people to give us their support, more governments, companies, and communities to share the responsibility of helping refugees. That is how we will regain our freedom and independence, and repay those who came to our aid.”
The three days of discussions, special events, and high-level dialogues in Geneva will focus on six key areas: arrangements for burden and responsibility sharing; education; jobs and livelihoods; energy and infrastructure; solutions; and protection capacity. There will be many opportunities for sharing a number of initiatives and good practices demonstrating how the Global Compact on Refugees can make a difference.
The Forum will also examine how humanitarian and development responses can complement one another. Additionally, in a sign of the increasingly important role of the private sector, more than 100 companies and foundations are attending and are set to make pledges around jobs, finance and other assistance.
The programme and further details about the Global Refugee Forum and related events are available here: https://www.unhcr.org/5d4bdb837

Title: ING, UNICEF pilot global initiative in PHL to explore fintech innovation for social impact
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
16 December 2019

On 18 October 2016, 4 year old John David Allam does his schoolwork despite a power outage in Tuguegarao City, Province of Cagayan, a day before Typhoon Haima made landfall in the northern part of the Philippines on 19 October 2016. Packing winds as much as 269km/h, Typhoon Haima, locally known as Typhoon Lawin was categorized as a super typhoon. UNICEF Philippines/2016/George Calvelo
MANILA, Philippines — ING, in partnership with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Office of Innovation, announced that it will pilot a global programme in the Philippines to jointly identify and invest in fintech startups that are building solutions with the potential to help disadvantaged youth and families in the country. New digital financial tools – if designed responsibly and with attention to the specific needs of these users – offer the potential to help build economic security, encourage more equitable access to services, and lift the financial barriers to opportunities for improving their lives.
The Philippines has enjoyed rapid economic growth in recent years; however, the benefits of this growth have not been shared equally; significant disparities remain. An estimated 10.5 million children live below the poverty line, and an estimated 2.85 million girls and boys aged 5-15 years are out of school. Despite a large and tech-savvy population, many still face stark inequalities, affecting their education, health outcomes, and future opportunities.
With this pilot, ING and UNICEF are building on a 14-year partnership; through their Power for Youth programme launched in 2015, they have touched the lives of over 1.5 million children and young people by providing skills and tools needed to become socially and financially independent. Inspired by and committing to this purpose, this pilot is an innovative way to deepen the partnership and continue empowering youth and families with tools needed to build a brighter future.
The ‘Fintech for Impact’ pilot aims to look for startup companies building innovative tools that will serve the financially excluded and hardest-to-reach communities in the country through open-source technology solutions, contributing to the growth of technology built for positive social impact. UNICEF’s Office of Innovation is particularly interested in companies that use fintech in new, ground-breaking ways that are scalable and globally applicable. The partners will jointly search and identify up to six (6) startups, award funding of up to $100,000 each, and engage them with invaluable technical and business mentorship along with other experts over a 12-month incubation period.
“Recent innovations in digital banking and financial technology have revolutionized the ways we do banking and made financial inclusion closer to reality. Fintech companies are our allies in building a more inclusive economy that will benefit everyone,” said ING Philippines Country Manager Hans B. Sicat. “Now, we are giving fintech startups an avenue to grow and become industry leaders of their own.”
“UNICEF is pleased to partner with ING to launch a fintech pilot programme in the Philippines. With the growth in digital technologies, I hope fintech startups building new tools will focus on products and services that could help more families and young people, and bridge the service and financial gaps leading to poverty reduction,” said Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov, UNICEF Philippines Representative.
According to the 2017 Financial Inclusion Survey of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), more than 52 million Filipino adults or 77.4 percent of the total adult population remain unbanked.
Sicat said that utilizing fintech solutions is an opportune time to ensure that the Philippine economy will be inclusive and felt even by some of the most marginalized sectors in the country. “ING and UNICEF are bullish about the potential that these fintech startups have to offer. The fast-changing technology landscape is an opportunity for youth and families to spur inclusive economic growth through financial inclusion and solutions,” Sicat added.
The Fintech for Impact pilot application period runs from 13 January to 23 February 2020 (23:59 PHT). Visit www.fintechforimpact.com for more information on the application process and eligibility, register for alerts, and reach out to the UNICEF Innovation team with your inquiries.

Title: UNHCR and UNICEF support Zamboanga City in pilot birth registration project for Sama Bajaus
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
06 December 2019


Sama Bajau IP community members receive birth certificates through a project spearheaded by the Zamboanga City local government, with support from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Present during the ceremonial distribution of 200 birth certificates to Sama Bajau people and families are Zamboanga City Major Beng Climaco (1st from left), UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov (5th from left), and UNHCR Philippines Representative Shinji Kubo (8th from left, back row). UNICEF Philippines/Jeoffrey Maitem
ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines – More than 200 Sama Bajaus were provided with birth certificates today, in a pilot birth registration project spearheaded by the Zamboanga City local government and supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
The distribution is the culmination of a pilot birth registration project for Sama Bajaus. Due to their itinerant way of life and because of generations of nonregistration among families, the Sama Bajaus face documentation issues, which in turn lead to their being at risk of statelessness. It is thought that there are 10,000 Sama Bajaus living in Zamboanga alone, around 85% of them without birth certificates.
UNHCR and UNICEF are providing technical assistance to the project under the UNHCR-UNICEF Joint Strategy for Addressing Childhood Statelessness. The pilot registration initiative also supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is a significant advance towards leaving no one behind.
“The Philippines, a signatory to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, has identified the Sama Bajaus as a population at risk of statelessness. After a series of consultations with Sama Bajau communities, UNHCR, as a leading UN agency toward ending statelessness by 2024, arrived at a recommendation to conduct a birth registration to address their documentation issues,” said Shinji Kubo, UNHCR Representative to the Philippines. “A birth certificate will help the community assert their rights. Ensuring birth registration also supports our global initiatives to prevent statelessness. This pilot birth registration demonstrates the commitment of the Government of the Philippines toward achieving the SDGs, ‘leaving no one behind.’”
“Every child/human has the right to a name and identity.  Birth registration forms the basis of identity. It has much larger implications on children to have access to education, health care and social services. This is invaluable for the indigenous population and those at risk of stateless such as the Sama Bajau we have reached,” said Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov, UNICEF Philippines Representative, “UNICEF is pleased to work with UNHCR in reaching the outlying communities facilitating access to birth registration that will have significant impact on their lives.”
A pilot registration project, which commenced in October this year, seeks to register 1,500 people in the community under the leadership of the Department of Justice. This project, which is also in line with the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022, is a concerted initiative involving the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Commission on Human Rights, and the Barangay Council of Kasanyangan, Zamboanga City.
By end-2019, the pilot activity aims to provide birth certificates to a total of 412 Sama Bajaus. The project aims to reach more communities in need of birth registration documents in 2020.

Title: WHO backs community-based distribution of anti-HIV pill
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
01 December 2019
MANILA, Philippines -- On the third floor of a nondescript building along Shaw Boulevard in Mandaluyong, Philippines, is a community centre that offers comprehensive HIV-related services. This centre is just one of the six in Mega Manila and another one in Cebu by the community-based organization LoveYourself. Each community centre caters to 60 to 100 clients every day.

“We have different programmes, different types of services for each and every aspect of the HIV care cascade,” said LoveYourself Program Manager Danvic Rosadiño. “That includes awareness, testing, prevention initiatives, treatment, care, and support. And we provide all of the services here for free.”

LoveYourself was established in 2012 by six people and has now grown with more locations, 90 full-time staff and 1,200 volunteers. In 2018, 20% of all HIV-positive diagnosis in the Philippines were made through LoveYourself. They also have 5,000 clients enrolled in treatment. LoveYourself is also partnering with 12 other community-based organizations spread across the country to share their lessons learnt and applying it to their context.

When asked about his thoughts on why LoveYourself has been successful in reaching their clients, Danvic explained, “We are the community, so we know how to reach out to the community.”

As a community of volunteers, feedback is important to the organization. "We always listen to the community,” said Danvic.

“We have mechanisms to facilitate  feedback of clients confidentially and in a manner that they won’t also be judged. If they have issues with their privacy, then they could email privacy@loveyourself.ph. If they need feedback that needs to be reported, it can be reported on our social media sites” he added. “And we will improve our services based on the feedback that we receive.”
The promise of PrEP
Danvic himself has evolved with LoveYourself. He started as a volunteer in the organization back in 2014 and now manages the oral pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV infection (PrEP) programme called PrEP Pilipinas.

PrEP is a safe and effective pill taken orally to prevent HIV sexual transmission. WHO recommends PrEP to all population groups at substantial risk from HIV infection. It is as an additional prevention choice in a comprehensive package of services that also includes HIV testing, counselling, male and female condoms, lubricants, antiretroviral treatment for partners with HIV infection, voluntary medical male circumcision and harm reduction interventions for people who use drugs.

PrEP was introduced in the Philippines through PrEP Pilipinas, which started as a community-based, peer-driven demonstration project in 2016 in partnership with the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine, WHO and amfAR. The goal of the demonstration project was to deliver, document and evaluate community-based PrEP services to men who have sex with men and transgender women, who received free PrEP medication (emticitrabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).

This project is close to Danvic’s heart as he himself saw the need for the drug.

“I myself, I wanted to have this drug because I know how to prevent HIV,” explained Danvic. “The only way for me to access it was to go to Bangkok. So you have to go there and access the check-ups and all so that you could get the drug. That was the only way before.”

With the demonstration project came promising results. First, there were no seroconversions among the 250 people enrolled in the project. In other words, no one who enrolled and stayed in the project became infected with HIV. Second, there was no significant increase in diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections among those who participated. Third, 88% of participants reported taking the drugs daily, and 99% reported to take at least 4 out of 7 pills per week. Fourth, there were also no serious side effects reported among the participants.

Highlighting the peer-driven component of the project, LoveYourself also tapped their community of volunteers to provide education and psychosocial support to the participants.

The project had limitations. This includes the small pool of participants and similarity in demographics, with almost all participants having higher education level and belonging to a higher-income bracket. Keeping these results and limitations in mind, a joint report by RITM, WHO and LoveYourself concluded that it’s possible to deliver PrEP in the Philippines in a non-medical, community-based way.

“We have seen that this model can be done, it can be replicated to other community-based organizations and even other facilities in the Philippines,” said Danvic. “PrEP can be rolled out not only by medical personal but also with trained non-medical personnel, if they work hand in hand to offer the service to the community.”
From the success of the demonstration project, LoveYourself scaled up and instituted the PrEP Pilipinas programme in June 2019. PrEP is now offered in LoveYourself facilities.

“Right now, it’s out of pocket,” said Danvic. “The drug costs around 1,500 pesos per bottle. It contains 30 tablets per bottle, so it’s good for one month if you take it daily. And there are also some service costs just to sustain the programme. So for you to start, you need around 2,000 pesos but the price decreases as you continue to take the medication and you access it at LoveYourself facilities.”

“This is mostly offered in community-based organizations because the community wants to access them in organizations that they feel they are safe spaces to them. There are other community-based organizations that will be offering PrEP soon, one in Iloilo, one in Davao. Other community-based organizations are also contacting us so that they could also offer PrEP. So soon, very soon,” he added.

Aside from LoveYourself, there are also private doctors who provide PrEP as well, giving people the option where they want to access it.

There are now 450 already enrolled in PrEP Pilipinas and it is slowly growing. LoveYourself is working with their volunteers and influencers to ramp up the marketing and promotion of this pill. They have posted social media cards with influencers to market PrEP in the country.

“With regards to cost [in marketing], it’s very minimal because we don’t pay the influencers for our photo shoot with them. Even the crafting of the messages, they’re all done by volunteers,” said Danvic. “So it’s really a community effort to reach out to other people and to spread out the messaging that PrEP is here in the Philippines.”

Title: Philippines adopts gender-sensitive policing of human trafficking
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
29 November 2019
MANILA, Philippines — Colonel Portia Manalad was the first female cadet to graduate from the Philippine Police Academy in 1995. Twenty-five years later, she is now the first woman police director of Cotabato city, but her journey was far from easy. “The challenges came one after the other, which made me believe that I created a stronger self, knowing that I had to make the double effort of men just to prove myself,” she said.
Colonel Manalad shared her story during a five-day training for the Philippines security sector hosted by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and UN Women, with the support by the Government of Canada, on 25-29 November 2019. During the training, representatives from the Philippine National Police and the Bureau of Customs scrutinized gender stereotypes and explored gender-responsive and survivor-centred approaches to crime investigation.
Officer Maria Cristina Fuentes from the Bureau of Customs drew a parallel between Colonel Malanad’s story and her own. “In the beginning, women in the law enforcement and Bureau of Customs were not really included much in the operations like the men are,” she said. “One challenge is for me to prove that I am worthy of the job that they have given me.”
Officer Fuentes also addressed the double burden of being a woman in her profession. “One of the greatest challenges for me is society’s thinking that we are part of a corrupt agency, so we live with that emotion every day. But for me, as long as I do my job properly, I think I can survive that struggle”.
The training was part of a larger initiative carried out in South-East Asia, which seeks to both increase knowledge of community-centred and gender-sensitive policing, especially with regards to trafficking in persons, and to increase the role of women in law enforcement. Women and girls experience this cross-border crime differently and disproportionately to men and boys. 71 per cent of victims of trafficking globally are women and girls. Among female trafficking victims, 72 per cent are trafficked for sexual exploitation (Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, UNODC, 2016). This is despite sustained efforts, globally and in the Philippines, to address the incidences of human trafficking and to assist those who become survivors of trafficking overseas.
Guided visualisation exercises were an innovative element of the training and allowed the participants to tap into a deeper empathic understanding of coping mechanisms of survivors of violence and trauma. Part of this was making them aware of how reliving a memory can have a powerful, almost physical impact on someone’s senses. To demonstrate this, facilitator Stephanie Hill guided the participants to picture a lemon tree in fruit. As the participants were asked to take a bite of the imaginary lemons, their faces puckered, and many were surprised by the tangibility of the sensation.
“In the training room we only focus on positive experiences, but by exploring their own memories, participants can understand how the recollection of traumas may be experienced and recalled by survivors or witnesses of crime,” explained Hill. For many officers, the practical tools that were explored during the training to more deeply understand survivors’ needs and experiences were novel. They recognized that integrating survivor-centred and gender-responsive techniques could be critical for improving the effectiveness of their work.
Participants expressed a strong commitment to continue building on the insights and skills gained through the training, while also recognizing some of the challenges ahead. “Sometimes the strong person that others see is the product of hard work or an art that was brought by challenging situations,” said Colonel Manalad. “I might be challenged, tired, denied, ignored or confused but as a woman I am determined to be resilient.” said Colonel Manalad, summarising the determination of many of the officers going forward.
The final day of the training was wrapped up by discussing key lessons learned and identifying how they may be brought into the daily work of the participants.

Title: Young Filipino innovators gather for UNDP Youth Social Innovation Lab
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
21 November 2019

MANILA, Philippines – More than 100 young innovators, mentors and stakeholders attended the 2019 Youth Social Innovation Lab, held on 18 and 19 November and hosted by Youth Co:Lab Philippines in partnership with makesense, co-led by Citi Foundation. The participants, who come from different youth sectors all over the Philippines were selected to come together to pitch and develop their ideas for socially inclusive sustainable enterprises. With the theme “Social Inclusion,” the two-day hackathon held at the Benilde Hub of Innovation for Inclusion (HiFi) showcased the ideas of innovative Filipinos aged 15-30, including high school and university students, new graduates, youth affected by conflicts and/or disasters, LGBT+, differently-abled youth, and those from ethnic and religious minorities.
Through intensive integrated learning sessions rooted on human-centered and design thinking methods, participating youth were grouped together and had the opportunity to be mentored by experts to develop and harness their ideas into tangible and marketable solutions. The teams then had to pitch their ideas to a board of jurors to clinch a spot at the Youth Co:Lab Regional Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, April next year, where they will have an opportunity to participate in a competition among fellow youth innovators across the Asia-Pacific region.
Five groups were selected  - AccesiWheels (first place) is a ride-hailing mobile application designed for persons with disabilities by persons with disabilities; #Ethnicoco (second place) is an enterprise driven to innovate high value-added products from devalued coconut agriculture wastes produced by indigenous communities; Transkonek (third place) is an online platform linking transgenders to job opportunities and other support services; Project Ka-sama (fourth place) is a virtual learning environment offering mental health and counseling classes to people with chronic medical conditions; and Greenhows (fifth place) is a co-creation lab that harnesses the ideas and potential of students, local artists, and people from displaced communities through stories and exhibitions, environmental campaigns, commerce, and capacity building.
The Youth Social Innovation Lab (YSIL) is hosted by Youth Co:Lab (YCL) Philippines in partnership with makesense. The initiative is also part of the first-ever Philippine Startup Week organized by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT.)
Co-created in 2017 by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Citi Foundation, Youth Co:Lab aims to establish a common agenda for countries in the Asia-Pacific region to empower and invest in youth, so that they can  accelerate the  implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through leadership, social innovation and entrepreneurship.
“Across our work towards achieving sustainable development, the youth has always been seen as agents and accelerators of change, with much of their future at stake. In the Philippines, approximately 30% of its population is made up of young people. That’s 32 million Filipino youth who we see as an invaluable resource that can make significant contributions to development impact through leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurship. We believe that we should harness that resource and keep them informed, inspired, and involved,” notes Enrico Gaveglia, Deputy Resident Representative of UNDP Philippines.
Lisa Coory, Head of Public Affairs at Citi Philippines, expressed Citi’s support of the initiative. “Our employee mentors who shared financial and technology expertise were greatly impressed by the breadth of innovative ideas. We congratulate all participants for taking the initiative to solve important problems affecting our communities and we look forward to cheering on the selected teams from the Philippines at the Regional Summit where they will join fellow youth from 24 other Asia-Pacific countries in April 2020.”
In order to establish an avenue to further support the rest of the participants of the Youth Social Innovation Lab, Youth Co:Lab and makesense will organize the first National Springboard Programme, a three-week online sprint to train young innovators who are in the ideation phase to learn the basics of entrepreneurship and have the opportunity to build prototypes for their solutions.

COTABATO CITY, Philippines – The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Government commits greater focus on children’s issues in a landmark Special Parliamentary Session to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the world.
The Bangsamoro Government responded to the BARMM Children’s Declaration advocating for better education, an end to poverty and hunger, lasting peace, more parenting programs and increased participation in finding solutions to issues that affect them.
Bangsamoro children are among the poorest in the country and are left behind under all major indicators of development:
“Almost 30 years after the Philippines ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, far too many children are still left behind particularly in BARMM,” said Karin Hulshof, UNICEF Regional Director for East Asia and Pacific. “CRC, in its 30th year, is about building on the gains address the unfinished business. It is about to reinvigorating the efforts to end disparities and deprivations children continue to suffer,” she added.
BARMM Government Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim delivered a statement of commitment to protect and promote the rights of children and address these pressing issues. In addition, he co-authored, together with majority of the members of the Bangsamoro Parliament Resolution No. 147, a resolution “giving full support to Bangsamoro Children’s Declaration in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.”
The resolution reiterates provisions from the Bangsamoro Organic Law, “Bangsamoro policies and programs shall take into utmost consideration the best interest of children and promote the rights of children. Youth, and adolescents, including their survival and development. The Bangsamoro Government and its constituent local government units shall provide for adequate funding and effective mechanisms for the implementation of this policy.”
Business leaders, religious leaders, diplomatic missions, the media, non-government organizations, civil society organizations, as well as all the five governors of the BARMM provinces also made their pledges in support of the Children’s Declaration.
“Today’s special Parliamentary session is a firm step to change what is business as usual,” said Ms. Hulshof. “We see children and youth are given the rightful space to have their say on what they envision.
“Congratulations to our young friends for voicing their views so wisely. We commend the BARMM Government for owning the accountability and for giving children hope and the opportunities that are rightly theirs. I also thank the professional groups and stakeholders for joining the Call with their pledges of support,” she said.
Before joining the Special Parliamentary Session on children, children from all over the Bangsamoro celebrated World’s Children’s Day in a festive and colorful #GoBlue celebration.
UNICEF is partnering with Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC) and Department of Health to support the Natioanal Children’s Month celebrated in the Philippines in November. The 27th National Children’s Month in November 2019 will highlight the Philippines’ implementation of the CRC and its accomplishments in celebrating the CRC@30. The NCM 2019 is led by the Council for the Welfare of Children (CWC), Department of Social Welfare and Development and the National Youth Commission. The activities are focused on four cluster of child rights: survival, development, participation and protection, in each week of November. UNICEF is particularly supporting CWC in the youth camps addressing issues around adolescents and mental health.

Title: Second chances: Op-Ed for International Youth Day 2019
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
12 August 2019
In 2002, 19-year-old Radam Jalani, who lived in the small seaside village of Mercedes in Zamboanga City, was resigned to being a seaweed farmer for the rest of his life. When he was 12 years old, Radam’s father asked him to quit school to help his family scrape out a living from planting seaweed. The 10 years that followed stretched out like a lifetime for Radam, taking him farther and farther away from school. And yet, just six years after contemplating a future he thought he could not escape, Radam began to live the life he had chosen for himself.
Radam returned to school. As a teacher.
Through the Department of Education (DepEd)’s Alternative Learning System (ALS), Radam completed his Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) degree. He has been teaching the second grade class at his old school since June 2018.
The UNICEF Education Programme in the Philippines supports the ALS program by enhancing the capacity of the Government to provide holistic, equitable and inclusive education for all children and adolescents. UNICEF Philippines has developed priority actions targeting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged girls and boys, who have limited access to learning opportunities due to poverty, armed conflict, social discrimination or health issues.
Not too far away from Radam, Rijal Ibrahim Rasul and Jewelyn Baguio watched helplessly as their lives were turned upside down by the 2013 Zamboanga siege. Rijal had dropped out of college to sell fish with his father. When the conflict had passed, Rijal tried to find better work but he found his options severely limited by his age, religion and inadequate education. Jewelyn took a long time to recover from the trauma of hearing gunshots and had to stop working.
Rijal and Jewelyn needed to make a living but the disruption in their lives had affected their ability to find decent work. Help came through the United Nations (UN) Peacebuilding Support Office, where the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) helped young people like Rijal and Jewelyn to find jobs and sustainable livelihoods in Zamboanga.
The ILO worked with industry partners to transform education by matching skills with the demands of employers, thus enhancing youth employability. Rijal and Jewelyn were among those trained under a special course in hotel management. As they gained knowledge and skills, they also developed a positive mindset, which boosted their confidence. When Rijal and Jewelyn completed the course in 2017, they were immediately hired by one of the largest hotels in Zamboanga.
The Philippines has achieved near-universal primary enrolment rate at 94.2 as of 2017. Furthermore, in the past two years, the Government has substantially increased completion rates for primary and secondary education, by 8.4 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. We commend the Government for progress on this front. However, we need to turn our attention to Filipino children and youth who should be in school, but are not.
According to the latest Annual Poverty Indicators Survey (APIS), one out of every 10 Filipinos aged 6 to 24 was out of school, and the prevalence has generally been higher among the older age groups. Of the 3.6 million out of school children and youth, 83.1 percent were 16 to 24 years old, 11.2 percent were 12 to 15 years old and 5.7 percent were 6 to 11 years old.
The high cost of education accounts for why many of the country’s children and youth are not in school. According to the APIS, financial difficulty was one of the top three reasons (17.9 percent), for not attending school. About half of all out-of-school children and youth belongs to the poorest 30 percent of Filipino families, most of whom live in rural, agricultural areas. In many instances, boys and girls have missed classes – or skipped school entirely – to help their families to put food on the table.
Yet, while poverty factors largely in school-leaving, it is not the foremost reason.
Early marriage and family matters topped the list of reasons, at 37 percent, followed by lack of interest, at 24.7 percent.
It is notable that the proportion of out-of-school children and youth was also higher among females (63.3 percent) than males (36.7 percent), and that for over half of all girls and young women that have had to leave school, early marriage or family matters were the leading causes. In the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), which has the highest percentage of out-of-school children and youth in the country, girls have a particularly hard time staying in school. Household chores, and poor menstrual hygiene management, including the lack of appropriate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities in school, have driven girls to distraction, causing them to miss classes and thereafter to stay away from school.
In order to reduce drop-out rates, it is necessary to curb the high incidence of early pregnancy  among young Filipinos. The Department of Education, with support from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is leading the implementation of an age- and development-appropriate Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) curriculum that will also be implemented in Alternative Learning Systems (ALS).
CSE is a curriculum-based process of teaching and learning about cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects of sexuality and reproductive health. It will equip young Filipinos with the correct information and appropriate life skills that would enable them to make responsible decision-making and respectful behavior, protecting their health, well-being and dignity. Apart from reducing the incidence of early pregnancy, CSE also seeks to address violence, particularly bullying, and HIV infection.
By adopting the 2030 Agenda, UN Member States, including the Philippines, have committed to Leave No One Behind in their implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). All people, regardless of their backgrounds, have rights and responsibilities to fulfill their potential in life, including out-of-school youth.
Tacking the persistent disparities in education participation and promoting education enrollment and quality is also a government strategy to address the challenges to inclusive growth, as highlighted in the 10-point socioeconomic agenda of the Duterte Administration: “Invest in human capital development, including health and education systems, and match skills and training to meet the demand of businesses and the private sector.”
Beyond the classroom, opportunities for young people who are not in school are growing. There are now many ways to transition from school or out-of-school to work or event entrepreneurship. Non-formal education should not be seen as an alternative to formal education, but rather recognized for its complementariness in providing a more fully rounded and skills-based approach, to equip young people to meet the competing demands of the workforce. Youth engagement is crucial to bringing about more relevant, equitable and inclusive education.
On August 12, we celebrate International Youth Day. This year’s theme, “Transforming Education,” resonates in the work that the Government and UN agencies are doing to make education fit the learner, and not the other way around. To find solutions to ensure that children and young people who have fallen back are not left behind. To give the Radam Jalanis of this country the one thing that could turn their life around: a second chance. [Ends]

Title: The UN stands with Pride
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
15 June 2019
This Pride Month, the United Nations (UN) in the Philippines stands in solidarity with the community of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) Filipinos, their families, friends and allies in their pursuit of equality, inclusion and pride.
The struggle for the rights of LGBTQI people is a core part of the struggle for the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by all.
The very first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that, “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”
All human beings – not some, not most, but all.
And yet, in the Philippines as in other parts of the world, members of the LGBTQI community continue to face barriers to equal access to education, healthcare, employment, and other rights that are guaranteed by national and international laws. The LGBTQI community contends with many of the same discriminations that stand in the way of women, indigenous people, Persons with Disabilities, Persons Living with HIV, and other groups as they stake their claim to their social, political and economic rights. It is essential that we defend and protect all of these groups from every kind of discrimination so that no one is left behind.
Since 1996 LGBTQI Filipinos have been celebrating Pride to advocate for greater promotion and recognition of their rights and freedoms that are protected under Philippine and international law, and for protection from prejudice, discrimination, and violence because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics (SOGIESC).
LGBTQI organizations in the Philippines, civil society organizations, the private sector, government agencies, and local government units have tirelessly worked together to address the challenges that LGBTQI Filipinos face, particularly through gender-responsive policies in education, SOGIESC-inclusive workplaces, and anti-discrimination legislation in various parts of the country, among others. As a partner of these groups, organizations, and institutions, the UN Philippines supports initiatives to achieve full recognition of the rights of LGBTQI Filipinos.
We commend the cities and provinces in the Philippines that have adopted and are implementing ordinances that prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person’s sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE). Unfortunately, these local government units are still in the minority. Only 21 of the 1,634 cities and municipalities and six out of the 81 provinces in the Philippines have anti-discrimination ordinances (ADOs). This leaves 79.2% of Filipinos, or close to 80 million people, without protection against SOGIE-based discrimination.
Furthermore, the protection afforded by these ADOs varies across different areas. Not all of the LGUs that have enacted ADOs have also passed Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRRs). Thus, the ADOs could remain unenforceable.
The UN Philippines therefore affirms its support for the LGBTQI community’s call for the passage of the SOGIE Equality Bill and urges renewed efforts to push for its enactment by the 18th session of Congress.
The United Nations is committed to action.
Just two years ago, the Human Rights Council decided to appoint the first ever UN Independent Expert on the protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Victor Madrigal-Borloz took up his mandate on 1 January 2018. This was a historic step.
We work with decision makers, human rights institutions and community leaders around the world to change discriminatory laws and put legal protections in place.
But as we all know, legal change is not enough—we also need social and cultural change.
The stigma perpetuating the abuses against LGBTQI people is often rooted in deeply held beliefs about gender, family, tradition and religion. And reactionary forces are not shying away from weaponizing people’s fears of the unfamiliar for their own political gains. Moreover, equality cannot be won by the LGBTQI community alone – they need allies who will use their influence and voice to promote equality for the LGBTQI community.
Recognizing this need, the UN human rights office launched the UN Free & Equal campaign in July 2013 – an unprecedented global UN public information campaign aimed at promoting equal rights and fair treatment of LGBTQI people. It is being implemented by UN and non-UN partners at the country level.
We are also looking at ourselves and what we can do better to ensure that members of the LGBTQI community among our staff enjoy an accepting and equal workplace. UN Globe is a network of UN staff that advocates for the equality and non-discrimination of LGBTQI staff in the UN system and its peacekeeping operations.
We have momentum on our side. But we need to come together to address the remaining challenges. The Metro Manila Pride March and Festival this Saturday offers one such opportunity and the UN Philippines will join in the celebration under the banners of UN Free & Equal, and UN Globe.
You and I and people of conscience everywhere must keep pushing until we realize the promise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for all people. The freedom, dignity and equal rights that all people are born with—should and must be a living reality for the LGBTQI community each and every day of their lives.

Title: Message of the UN Resident Coordinator in the Philippines on International Women's Day 2019
Content: UN Philippines 2023 Annual Report
08 March 2019
At the start of this year, a Filipino scientist became one of the directors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the world's preeminent organization for nuclear technology and its safe and peaceful applications.
The Filipino scientist is a woman--Dr. Jane Gerardo-Abaya. She now leads the IAEA’s Department of Technical Cooperation Asia and the Pacific Division which provides technical cooperation support to 37 countries and territories in Asia and the Pacific.
Dr. Abaya's appointment reverberated among Filipino communities around the world and was cited by the Philippine government as a remarkable achievement in the country's efforts to increase women's representation at national and global centers of power.
The theme for International Women’s Day 2019 is “Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change”. The theme puts innovation at the centre of efforts to build solutions that work for women and girls and achieve gender equality.
Last February 22, in observance of the International Day for Women and Girls in Science, the International Labour Organization (ILO) cited four Filipino women that have distinguished themselves in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM): Aileen Judan Jiao, president and country general manager of IBM Philippines and the first Filipina leader of the company; Ambe Tierro, senior managing director for global artificial intelligence of Accenture Technologies; Maria Cristina Coronel, president and chief executive officer of Pointwest Technologies; and Michie Ang, founding director of Women Who Code Manila.
Dr. Abaya and these four other Filipina game changers in STEM are truly exceptional. Their achievements, and others with them, are examples of what has contributed to placing the Philippines among the top ten countries of the 2018 Gender Gap Report of the World Economic Forum that benchmarks 149 countries on their progress towards gender parity across four thematic dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.
Still, as we congratulate the Philippines on this achievement, much remains to be done before the Philippines can truly claim to have attained Sustainable Development Goal 5, to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls - with the other goals of the 2030 Agenda that also need to be achieved to support this objective. In fact and unfortunately, many women in the Philippines continue to face existential challenges on a daily basis.
These challenges include threats to their lives from childbirth. Today, out of 100,000 Filipino women who give birth, 114 do not survive. This maternal mortality rate is higher than in other countries in Southeast Asia. It is a long way off from the Sustainable Development Goal 3 of reducing maternal deaths to less than 70 out of every 100,000 live births. The recent adoption of the Universal Health Care Act, or Republic Act 11223, if fully implemented, will go a long way in addressing weaknesses of the health system that have failed to prevent deaths resulting from complications related to pregnancy. As the Philippines moves forward, let’s all join in the call that “no woman should die while giving life”.
They also include exposure to sexual violence. According to the National Demographic and Health Survey of 2017, 14-15% of Filipino girls as young as 13 to 17 years old have been sexually violated. The same survey showed that two in five women, from 15 to 49 years old, have experienced physical or sexual violence and have NEVER told anyone about what had happened to them nor sought help to put an end to their torment. And let’s not forget that young boys have also been victimized. In fact, by almost 6 percentage points, more boys than girls in the ages of 13 to 17 have experienced sexual violence. We welcome ongoing legislative advocacy to strengthen the Anti-Rape Law in order to raise the age of consent from below 12 to 16, and to remove the "forgiveness clause" by which the subsequent marriage between the offender and the victim extinguishes the criminal action or the corresponding penalty. Let’s all come together in a resolve that latest by 2030, all girls and women should be free of sexual violence, as should boys and men.
The four dimensions of the WEF Gender Gap Report do not fully account for conditions that continue to hold Filipino women back in some areas, but they reflect unmistakable progress that has been achieved in improving the lives and well-being of Filipino women and girls over the years. They also affirm that an all-of-society approach involving the government, civil society and other stakeholders can finally bridge a chasm that is as old as humanity itself.
By the same convergence of purpose, outstanding contributions by women will continue to advance society; mothers will live to see their children being born; and all persons, regardless of gender, will be free from sexual violence.
