Title: FRIENDS project team conduct successful mission in Kazakhstan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
14 June 2023
Since April 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been implementing a regional project to boost the national capacities of countries to restore forests and other wooded lands, while also strengthening their expertise in preventing degradation.
The “Forest Restoration Improvement for Environmental Development and Sustainability in Central Asia” project, also known as FRIENDS, is being executed in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, under the auspices of the FAO-Türkiye Forestry Partnership Programme (FTFP).
According to the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan, approximately 70 per cent of the country is classified as degraded. Most of the affected areas consist of arid zones composed of saxaul forests, steppes and agricultural land. Land degradation is driven primarily by overgrazing and salinization. In saxaul forests, the main causes of degradation include fuelwood removal, charcoal production and livestock grazing.
In support of the project’s activities, Project Manager Adem Bilgin and FAO Forestry Officer Peter Pechacek undertook a mission to Kazakhstan from 29 May to 1 June 2023, to assess needs for capacity-building initiatives and to visit potential pilot sites for the demonstration of restoration techniques. In addition, a meeting held with the National Project Coordinator (NPC) of the FRIENDS project in Kazakhstan provided an opportunity to update their counterpart on project progress.
Bilgin and Pechacek assessed potential pilot sites in the Akmola region located within the premises of the State Enterprise “Republican Forest Breeding and Seed Centre” nursery. They also inspected potential pilot sites in the Almaty region. Both regions and relevant sites were suggested by the Kazakhstan authorities.
As a result of their visit and assessment, Bilgin and Pechacek confirmed that the project is on course to achieve its objectives. Their mission also contributed to the planning of future activities.

14 June 2023
Budapest, Hungary, 8 June — The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) organized a study tour as part of its project "Supporting investments in smallholders inclusive agrifood value chain development in Kazakhstan."
The tour took place from June 5 to 8 and included participation in the third Regional Workshop on Integrated Community Development, which was held from June 6 to 8 in Budapest, Hungary.
Several senior ministers and members of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan and representatives from academia and think-tanks made up the Kazakhstan delegation.
The study tour showcased good practices in local rural development and agricultural cooperatives in Europe. Participants also had the opportunity to visit notable institutions, including the Ministry of Agriculture and the Parliament of Hungary, where they explored various topics such as rural development tools, enhancing cooperative processes, and improving access to public services, and infrastructure in rural areas.
Kazakhstan’s representatives shared valuable insights and gained practical knowledge on increasing competitiveness, promoting entrepreneurship, and developing new types of economic activity in rural areas. They also learned about successful experiences in rural cooperative processes and strategies to enhance access to public services and improve social and economic infrastructure in rural areas.
The highlight of the tour was the third Regional Workshop on integrated community development. This workshop provided a platform to discuss and present the main results of the FAO study on good practices in integrated community development and territorial approaches in Europe and Central Asia, currently in development. The workshop also facilitated the exchange of practical experiences, lessons learned, and different approaches to local rural development, including the EU LEADER approach for non-EU countries.
During the workshop, Nurbolat Kurmetuly, director of the Quality-of-life department of the Economic Research Institute, and Galiya Akimbekova, Associate Professor, Deputy Chair of the Board of the Kazakh Research Institute of Economy of Agro-Industrial Complex and Rural Development, presented their findings on the rural development approaches in Kazakhstan. Their research is especially relevant in light of the recently approved government plan, the “Concept of rural development of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2023–2027,” which aims to develop institutional support, improve the effectiveness of approaches to the development of rural areas, improve the quality of life, and create a comfortable living environment in rural areas.
The study tour and workshop addressed the complex challenges faced by rural communities, smallholders, and family farmers in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The integrated and cross-sectoral approach emphasized during the tour aligns with the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, promoting coordinated and coherent solutions for rural transformation, poverty reduction, and inclusive development.
FAO remains committed to supporting local rural development and community development initiatives across the region. By strengthening partnerships with key regional and national actors, FAO continues to advance the concept of integrated community development.

Title: FAO conducts a series of trainings to address obsolete pesticides and contaminated soils in Kazakh agriculture
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
14 June 2023
ASTANA, 9 June 2023 - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) held a series of 3-day training programs in Shymkent, Atyrau and Almaty to address the challenge of obsolete pesticides in Kazakhstan.
The trainings aimed to equip about 90 participants, including national and regional authorities, inventory teams, and relevant stakeholders, with the knowledge and tools to establish a national inventory of obsolete pesticides and develop effective management and disposal strategies based on the inventory data.
The workshops were organized as part of of the FAO project “Lifecycle Management of Pesticides and Disposal of POPs Pesticides in Central Asian countries and Türkiye” funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Kazakhstan, with its vast arable land covering over 21 million hectares, faces important challenges from the remnants of Soviet-era obsolete pesticides and soil contamination from persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The improper management and disposal of these chemicals pose serious risks to human health and the environment. Today, data on the location, type and amount of obsolete pesticides at the country’s 727 pesticide stores is lacking. Also, it must be assumed that there are many additional sites, where pesticides have been buried without proper environmental safeguards.
To address this issue, FAO has developed two methodologies. The first method is appropriate for obsolete pesticides in the packaging in stores, while the second, known as Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA), evaluates potentially contaminated sites. Both methodologies provide the information to assess risks to the environment and health and prioritise risk management measures.
The 3-day training programs conducted by FAO aimed to enhance the knowledge and skills of inventory teams and among national and regional governmental authorities. The training covered various topics such as planning the inventory process, risks from obsolete pesticides and health protection measures for the inventory teams, data collection, data processing and storage.
During the training, participants visited former pesticide stores, applying the two methodologies and collecting soil samples for chemical analysis. The participating agencies from four regions (Turkestan, Atyrau, West Kazakhstan and Almaty regions) developed work plans and committed to providing administrative and technical support throughout the inventory process.
The training programs received positive responses from local executive state bodies, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and several NGOs. Their active participation ensured the success of the training programs and highlighted the collective commitment to addressing the pressing issues related to obsolete pesticides and contaminated soils in Kazakhstan.
FAO will conduct additional trainings in other regions of Kazakhstan, with inventory work scheduled for 2023. By the end of this year, data from the country as a whole will be gathered.  Based on that, FAO anticipates a significant improvement in the understanding and management of obsolete pesticides and contaminated soils in Kazakhstan.
The establishment of a national inventory will provide a solid foundation for developing effective strategies and undertaking practical work to mitigate the risks associated with these hazardous substances. FAO remains dedicated to supporting Kazakhstan in its ensuring a safe and sustainable agricultural sector for the present and future generations.

Title: Kazakhstan shares innovative approaches to advancing gender equality through digitalisation at CSW67
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
16 March 2023
Kazakhstan presented its experience in applying digital innovations to advance gender equality and women's empowerment at a side event of the sixty-seventh session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW67), hosted at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
Entitled "Kazakhstan’s experience in applying digitalisation and innovation to accelerate delivery on Generation Equality Forum’s Action Coalitions commitments,” the event was hosted on March 9, and was organized by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and National Commission for Women Affairs, Family and Demographic Policy under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan with support from UN Women Kazakhstan.
During the side event, government representatives from Kazakhstan presented national achievements in fulfilling the commitments made at the Generation Equality Forum (GEF). In 2021, within the framework of the GEF, Kazakhstan joined two Action Coalitions to address Gender-Based Violence and advance Economic Justice and Rights followed by taking five commitments to close the gaps on gender equality. Kazakhstan’s commitments in the context of the GEF are based on President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s policy to end violence against women and girls and promote women’s economic empowerment. During the side event, Kazakhstan highlighted innovative digital approaches in designing and delivering on international promises on gender equality.
One of the approaches highlighted was the regional community and virtual knowledge repository “Act for Equal”, a platform launched to share best practices on gender equality and prevention of violence against women and girls in Central Asia, supported by UN Women Kazakhstan. The community is for comprehensive discussions with the participation of representatives of various government agencies, parliamentarians, experts, and civil society from Central Asia and Afghanistan. Since 2021, the regional community of practice convened stakeholders, experts and activists to share their experience in the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action, as well as the women, peace and security and human rights and gender equality agendas in Central Asia. Thanks to the platform, around 1000 partners have strengthened cooperation and exchanged knowledge and skills.
In addition, Kazakhstan invested in the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative Regional Programme for Central Asia and Afghanistan.
Currently, Kazakhstan ranks 28th in the UN E-Government Development Index and 15th in the E-Participation Index among 193 countries.
“Today Kazakhstan is at the forefront in using technological solutions that improve the quality of life of people. We are creating an ecosystem to enable innovations. The Astana Hub – our flagship for IT startups- offers generous tax incentives, visa support and other benefits to attract young and talented IT specialists from all over the world. The services include access to free acceleration courses with the participation of global mentors, courses in innovative IT schools. The proportion of female staff at the Astana Hub Technopark is 61%, with 63% of women in managerial positions. More than 30% of IT-school students are women,” said Bagdat Mussin, Minister of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry of Kazakhstan, in his opening speech.
In order to use innovative and technological approaches, the government of Kazakhstan launched the Digital Family Social Card, designed to facilitate social support to vulnerable groups. The Digital Family Social Card is a digital platform that accumulates data from 24 government agencies, 30 data resources and determines the level of social well-being of citizens to proactively ensure the provision of government services.

"This is a digital platform that presents a 'real picture' of those in need of assistance, and provides measures of state support, conducts constant monitoring of families in difficult situations. This allows us to see the family's problems and send them messages and push notifications with offers of support and services without bureaucracy," outlined Minister Mussin.
UN Women supported the development of the digital platform specifically targeting early prevention and detection of violence within the family and by widening access to special social services for survivors of domestic violence. The methodology for identifying social risks can potentially become the basis for the process of preventing the onset of social risk, including any act of violence against women and identifying people in a difficult life situation. The Digital Social Card will assess and predict the level of vulnerability of the individual through gender-sensitive indicators in 4 areas: health care, education, social services, law enforcement agencies.
Supporting women’s entrepreneurship
Last year, 17 Women’s Entrepreneurship Development Centers (WEDCs) were launched in Kazakhstan across the country, giving women the opportunity to start or expand their businesses. This project of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs “Atameken” is supported by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, the National Commission for Women Affairs, Family and Demographic Policy under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Government of Kazakhstan, UN Women, UNDP, and the Asian Development Bank. The centers, among other types of consultations on access to knowledge, finances and networks, also provides women with the necessary tools and knowledge to digitalize their businesses and establish them on e-commerce platforms.
"The Women Entrepreneurship Development Centers provided a total of 26,386 different services to 9,000 women. A special feature of this project was the provision of services according to the needs of women themselves. Among the training programs, the courses on social media marketing and marketplace business were in particular high demand. Thus, women entrepreneurs and women with entrepreneurial initiative got an opportunity to digitalize their business," said Nurgul Musabekova, coordinator of the Women's Entrepreneurship Development Centers.
Perizat Inkarbayeva, founder of Dignatera, a digital technology center in Karaganda, won a grant from the city's mayor office after receiving training at one of the Women's Entrepreneurship Development Centers. Her project to teach robotics and neurotechnology was recognized as relevant and in demand.
"Thanks to the WEDC, I was trained in social entrepreneurship. Today there are more than 150 children studying at our center, and the income of my business has doubled. The most important is that children have the opportunity to learn digital technology. Our center has been operating for two years now. During these two years we prepared many winners of national and international competitions and created new workplaces for teachers. We are proud to contribute to the development of the city, as the national innovation center of Kazakhstan," said Inkarbayeva.
Also, as part of CSW67, the Kazakhstani digital art exhibition "Behind the door" was launched at the UN headquarters in New York. It is a social art project aimed at combatting domestic violence in Kazakhstan. The language of contemporary art tells five stories of women survivors of violence. The art pieces were created by Kazakhstani women artists, and they are also placed in blockchain format on the NFT platform. The proceeds from their sale will be sent to support centers for women survivors of violence. This project is a social initiative of CITIX, a Kazakhstani company that uses smart solutions and DOOH ecosystems to draw attention to topical social issues. The exhibition is organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan with the support of UN Women Kazakhstan.
"At CSW67 the Kazakhstan delegation shared national best practices in using digital technologies for the public good and to support vulnerable groups. Kazakhstan's CSW67 side event showcased the country's key achievements, particularly the use of digital technologies in proactively fulfilling its commitments within the Generation Equality Forum Coalitions on Gender-Based Violence and Economic Justice and Rights. Brilliant works of Kazakhstani artists to raise awareness of the issue of gender-based violence are presented on the global platform and are available to delegates from all participating countries," commented Maria Dotsenko, UN Women Representative in Kazakhstan.

Title: UN experts agree that Kazakhstan's experience repatriating and reintegrating children and women returned from conflict zones serves as an example for many countries
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
16 March 2023
.
The European Union, Kazakhstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNICEF, UN Women Kazakhstan, and the Committee for Children Rights Protection of the Ministry of Education summarized the results of their joint work rehabilitating and reintegrating children, women, and families returned from conflict zones.
During two humanitarian operations, respectively called Zhusan and Rusafa, joint efforts saw 725 people, including 188 women and 522 children, returned to Kazakhstan from conflict zones. Most children were under 12 years old.
"Applying a multi-sectoral approach to the rehabilitation and reintegration of children and women has proven to be effective, which is evident from the results of the programme implemented jointly with international organisations. The individual approach to each child and the prioritisation of children's interests in the provision of state services has enabled positive results to be achieved. We hope that Kazakhstan's experience in general, as well as new approaches and recommendations developed jointly with international organizations, will be useful for professionals both inside and outside the country," said Talgat Kaliyev, the Ambassador-at-Large of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
In 2021, the Kazakhstan Government, together with UNICEF and UN Women launched a program, co-financed by the European Union, aimed at reintegrating women and children from conflict zones as well as providing children and their families with protection and access to social services and education.
According to Arthur van Diesen, UNICEF Representative in Kazakhstan, "Kazakhstan is one of the few countries that have repatriated most of its women and children, both from Syria and Iraq. We are very pleased that, in addition to repatriation, the Government of Kazakhstan, in cooperation with international organizations, has done a lot to rehabilitate and reintegrate children and their families. Kazakhstan's experience is very valuable for other countries in the region facing similar challenges. Ensuring the rights and interests of children should be a priority for everyone. Therefore, now our joint task is to make the positive changes that occurred with children and their families within the framework of Kazakhstan’s program sustainable."
The parties first established the National Resource Centre at Eurasian National University to provide general and advanced training to specialists working with these children. This centre allowed experts to communicate and jointly work with regional universities in Atyrau, Karaganda, Pavlodar, Turkestan, Almaty, and Shymkent, where colleagues exchanged experiences on training professional psychologists. Next, the parties established resource groups on education, psychosocial support, and mental health care for children and families within this framework.
More than 250 specialists and practitioners throughout Kazakhstan studied provision of the psychosocial support, legal, and ethical issues arising from the reintegration process, thanks to which, more than 200 children received improved psychosocial and educational services.
Experts also developed and presented the ‘stories between generations’ method of reaching repatriated citizens, which aims to restore lost family and social ties as well as promote responsible citizenship and identity. Through storytelling, older generations share their experiences with children to help teach them the ethics, values, and cultural norms of society in Kazakhstan, including differences between learned and expected behaviours. To date, programme officials trained the first group of teachers and employees from local executive bodies in Shymkent, Karaganda, Zhezkazgan, and Uralsk in this storytelling method. Experts also prepared video lessons to increase the number of trainees and promote the method’s long-term sustainability.
Following the training, experts provided specialists with practical manual on working with children and families returned from conflict zones. The manual contains detailed information on helping repatriated families adapt to their new environment and cope with the psychological trauma, emotional difficulties, and stress associated with past traumatic experiences. Kazakhstani and international experts developed the manual in accordance with international standards and ethical norms, and they included practical case management and psychological first aid recommendations. If necessary, case managers can provide full-fledged consulting services and refer repatriated families for legal aid, medical services, and other assistance.
“Children returned from conflict zones are primarily children. They went through a very traumatic experience that no child should have to face. The European Union is pleased to cooperate with the Kazakhstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNICEF, UN Women, and the Committee for Children Rights Protection as well as with local executive bodies and non-governmental organizations. Our joint efforts not only strengthen the state system of psycho-social services, they improve the lives of children themselves, opening the door to a better future for them,” said Kestutis Jankauskas, Ambassador of the EU Delegation to Kazakhstan.
The reintegration and subsequent acclimatisation of children into local society will help protect them from marginalization and discrimination. Meetings, conversations, and stories with returned children and their families using the ‘stories between generations’ framework will allow children to better understand not only their personal histories, traditions, and customs but also help them find their place in family, society and the country.
"The Republic of Kazakhstan is one of the first countries in the world to carry out the unprecedented Zhusan operation, during which more than 500 children were returned to the country. Today we are happy to receive information about their successes and achievements. 51% of children are A- and B-students. 30% of children became participants and winners of various academic competitions and creative contests. We sincerely believe that every child grows up as a proud citizen of the country,” said Nassymzhan Ospanova, Chairperson of the Committee for Children Rights Protection of the Ministry of Education.
“Women and children returned from Syria and Iraq experienced serious violations of fundamental human rights. Children and women among civilians suffer the most in armed conflicts. We, at UN Women, have worked extensively with civil society organizations to incorporate a gender approach into their work with the returnees and their families, as well as strengthened gender-sensitivity of media professionals in covering such conflicts and their consequences”, said Maria Dotsenko, UN Women Representative to Kazakhstan.
Conference participants also presented the main conclusions and recommendations developed using Kazakhstan’s best practice for repatriating and reintegrating children and women returned from conflict zones.

Title: UNICEF and Dinara Saduakassova launch a new charity campaign in Kazakhstan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
23 January 2023
Now everyone in Kazakhstan can contribute to the Family for Every Child charity campaign
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Kazakhstan, together with UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Dinara Saduakassova, launched the Family for Every Child fundraising campaign.
Under the campaign, every citizen of Kazakhstan will be able to contribute and help the most vulnerable children who may or have already been left without parental care and warmth. The aim of the campaign is to reduce the flow of children into institutions, to provide a quality family upbringing for every child, and to provide families with the necessary social services and support.
"The main priority of UNICEF in this good cause is to protect the right of every child to grow up in a caring family environment. I sincerely hope that your donations will contribute to this common cause for every child in Kazakhstan," said Arthur van Diesen, UNICEF Representative in Kazakhstan.
Dinara Saduakasova made a video address to the people of Kazakhstan, and noted that a child's happiest memories are connected with his or her family. It is in the family that the child feels safe. She underlined that the child, living separately from his or her parents and family faces the most severe trauma in his or her life, with long-term negative consequences. Dinara called on all caring Kazakhstani people to support the "Family for Every Child" campaign and make their contributions by link.
The right of every child to grow up in a family is guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by the Government of Kazakhstan in 1994. Unfortunately, each year up to 2,000 children in Kazakhstan for various reasons end up in orphanages. The most important task of UNICEF in Kazakhstan is to reduce the flow of children into such institutions and to provide each child with a quality family upbringing. It is extremely important to eliminate the reasons for the separation of children from their parents through family support programs by ensuring comprehensive protection of the civil, economic, social and cultural rights of children without any discrimination.
If the child could not be kept in the family with the birth parents, and when immediate family members are unable to care for the child, every effort must be made to provide family care by involving more distant relatives, or if this is not possible, in a family substitute setting. In order to prevent the placement of children in residential institutions, it is important to provide the necessary legal framework for the further development of the institution of professional foster families in Kazakhstan. At the same time the focus should remain on the child's birth family. Even if a child is placed in an orphanage or a professional foster family, work must be done to restore the rights of the blood relatives.
UNICEF's long-standing experience in this area around the world shows that it is possible through the development of parenting skills programs, providing universal coverage of families with children with medical and educational services, as well as accessible, safe, inclusive and fair social protection focused on the well-being of children. Currently, the Government of Kazakhstan, civil society and UNICEF together have achieved the following results for children and families in Kazakhstan:
The money raised through the "Family for Every Child" campaign will enable the continuation of comprehensive work to achieve the best results for every child in Kazakhstan. UNICEF's work is financed entirely through the voluntary support of millions of people around the world and our partners in government, civil society, and the private sector. That is why UNICEF pays special attention to the issue of transparency about sources of funding and to how and for what campaign’s resources are spent. As a member of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), UNICEF provides open and comprehensive public access to operational and program data through its Transparency Portal.
UNICEF's "Family for Every Child" program in Kazakhstan helps to prevent the separation of children from their parents and, if a child is placed in an institution, helps to reestablish contact with the biological parents and supports the provision of quality social, medical and educational services to Kazakhstani families. The main focus of the campaign is to prevent the placement of children in residential institutions and to prioritize family-based child care. Support the campaign and help children get what they need to reach their full potential, developing in a supportive family environment. Even a small monetary contribution, can improve the life of a child in need. Make a donation now on the website using this link.

Title: Mural symbolizing fight against gender-based violence opened in the capital's Triathlon Park
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
25 November 2022
In Kazakhstan, every 6th woman who had ever had a partner has experienced physical and sexual violence. Half of the women who experienced physical violence from a partner reported severe forms of violence.
November 25th is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which also marks the launch of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign. From November 25 to December 10, various campaigns are taking place around the world calling for the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls.
To honour the start of the campaign, 'Cyber Nomad' mural was opened in Astana's Triathlon Park at 4:00 pm on the 25th of November.
“This is the first portrait from a series of works based on the same concept, the creation of which was inspired by a real persona. The image of a strong woman who knows her worth, who is liberated and active - the embodiment of the historical character of a nomadic woman', says Kazakhstani artist Charli Sword, the author of the 'Cyber Nomad' mural sketch. She attempted to represent the issue of gender-based and domestic violence as a liberation and conscious opposition to the violence of the survivor herself.
The mural was presented by the  organisers of the event - representatives of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Canadian Embassy in Kazakhstan. The purpose of this campaign was to raise awareness about the issues of gender-based and domestic violence: according to statistics, last year 157,884 crimes were registered in Kazakhstan, of which 61,464 were reported as domestic violence. According to the Minister of Internal Affairs, more than 100,000 cases of domestic violence have been registered in nine months of 2022, but in 60% of cases the police were unable to press charges as the survivors refused to file a complaint.

Title: UN statement on temporary relocation of the UNAMA staff to Almaty
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
20 August 2021
ALMATY – The United Nations has on a temporary basis relocated some staff to Almaty, Kazakhstan, from where they will provide close support to the UN family’s work in Afghanistan.
It is envisaged that international personnel of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), as well as UN agencies, funds, and programmes, numbering up to around 100 in total, will establish a temporary office in Almaty. This measure is intended to enable the UN to keep delivering vital assistance to the people of Afghanistan with the minimum of disruption while, at the same time, reducing risk to UN personnel. Personnel will return to Afghanistan as conditions permit.
The UN is committed to staying and delivering support to the Afghan people in their hour of need.  The majority of humanitarian personnel remain in Afghanistan, providing vital assistance to millions in need.
The temporary remote office in Almaty may, depending on the security situation in Afghanistan, act as a temporary hub for UN staff to rotate in and out of Afghanistan.
The United Nations expresses its deep appreciation to the Government of Kazakhstan for its previous agreement to host a UNAMA remote office as well as the excellent cooperation provided yesterday when the first UNAMA staff arrived in Almaty.

Title: President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev delivered a video statement at the Generation Equality Forum
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
02 July 2021
NUR-SULTAN – President of Kazakhstan H.E. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev was among the key speakers at the Generation Equality Forum, currently taking place in Paris from 30 June to 2 July 2021.
H.E. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev underlined the importance of ending gender-based violence and enhancing social and legal support for women and children. He highlighted the role of Kazakhstan in accelerating gender equality in the regional dimension.
The Generation Equality Forum is a landmark event to accelerate progress on gender equality, launching a series of concrete, ambitious and transformative actions to achieve immediate and irreversible progress towards gender equality.
Convened by UN Women and co-hosted by the governments of Mexico and France, in partnership with youth and civil society, the Forum brought together governments, feminist leaders, youth and change makers from every sector, to announce trailblazing gender equality investments, programmes and policies. It marked the beginning of a five-year action journey led by six Action Coalitions and a Compact on Women, Peace and Security, and Humanitarian Action.
H.E. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan: “Over the 30 years of Independence, Kazakhstan was implementing progressive women-oriented policies. We have established a robust legal framework topped by the Concept of Family and Gender Policy until 2030. Last month, I signed a Decree on Further Human Rights Measures, with gender equality as one of its major focus areas. Kazakhstan also promotes gender issues as a foreign policy priority in the regional dimension”. The full video of the statement can be found on the website of Akorda here.
Many participants from Kazakhstan are registered in the Forum, including civil society organization as FemAgora, which has also committed in the Action Coalitions and will be working on the agenda of gender equality in the Central Asian region.
Alia El-Yassir, UN Women Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia: “This is a great opportunity for Kazakhstan to showcase its good practices in promoting gender equality at the global level, announce specific commitments and forge new partnerships. I would especially like to thank the civil society activists for their contributions to the Forum. Together we can build an equal future for everyone and ensure that the human rights of all women and girls are protected”.
The Forum comes at a critical moment to reverse rising gender inequality caused by COVID-19. Even before COVID-19, almost one in three women worldwide experienced abuse; during the pandemic, calls to helplines increased five-fold in some countries. At the current rate of progress, it will take another 130 years to reach gender equality at the highest positions of power. The Generation Equality Forum offers a critical opportunity to confront this rising crisis, as well as the enduring structural inequalities that preceded it.
Didier Canesse, French Ambassador to Kazakhstan: “France has brought together governments, international organizations, civil society representatives, youth, the private sector and activists from around the world to make together a set of concrete, ambitious and long-term commitments. This enduring movement for action and accountability will fuel a significant and lasting coalition for gender equality, offering a vital moment to achieve transformative change for generations to come”.

Title: Media Contest: Change for Climate in Kazakhstan
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
06 June 2021
The UN in Kazakhstan is offering the chance for journalists and bloggers in Kazakhstan to put their writing skills at the service of the environment and win vouchers for electronic equipment worth up to 2500 USD and a trip to COP26 Summit in Glasgow.
The contest starts on World Environment Day (5 June) and the winners will be announced on the International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies (7 September).
How is climate change affecting Kazakhstan, and what does it mean for our health, economy, food supply and all the nature we live with? What opportunities exist for adapting to climate change in Kazakhstan, or for mitigating it in the first place?
Our challenge to you is to write articles that make climate change the topic of conversation at breakfast and dinner tables across Kazakhstan and inspire the way for solutions.
Climate action is essential for building the world we all want after COVID-19. We must urgently get on track to bring the global temperature rise down to 1.5-degrees, in line with the Paris Agreement. The United Nations Secretary General has described climate change as the greatest challenge of our time.
Partly due to intensive urban development, the temperature of surface soil in Nur-Sultan can reach a stifling 65–70°C in the summer. Climate change means that temperatures in the capital are only likely to increase. In response, the city plans for over half of its land area to flourish with green cover by 2030. The green spaces will cool and clean the air, capture carbon dioxide, be a home to wildlife and boost citizen’s mental health, in a win-win for people and the environment.

Title: Kazakhstan will take part in the Global Generation Equality Forum in Paris
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
03 June 2021
Nur-Sultan – The Generation Equality Forum, organized under the auspices of UN Women and co-chaired by the Government of France, will take place on 30 June-2 July.
The Forum is a civil society-centered, global gathering for gender equality.
In 2021, although significant progress has been made, there is still much to be done. The Covid-19 pandemic has further exacerbated gender inequalities. In Kazakhstan and all around the world, women find themselves on the frontlines of the pandemic, bearing the brunt of the economic fallout, taking on more domestic work and childcare, and are more vulnerable to domestic abuse.
Generation Equality Forum 2021 aims to secure a set of concrete, ambitious, and transformative commitments to achieve immediate and irreversible progress towards gender equality in the next five years.
To achieve this ambition, a Global Acceleration Plan for Gender Equality will be launched in Paris. This Acceleration Plan is structured around six Action Coalitions, which each address a specific theme on women's rights and gender equality.
Maria Dotsenko, UN Women Representative in Kazakhstan said: “I am very glad to hear that Kazakhstan has officially joined two Action Coalitions on Economic Justice and Rights and Gender-Based Violence. This pro-active position of the country underlines the Government’s commitment to mobilize efforts to make progress towards gender equality and the realization of the human rights of women and girls. We are ready to further support these efforts of our Kazakhstani partners”.
She added: “It is very important to note that not only the government, but also civil society, the private sector, educational institutions and individuals are invited to register by June 18 through this link and get involved in the work within the Action Coalitions. This is a great opportunity for Kazakhstan not only to share its best practices in promoting gender equality at the global level, but also to announce new initiatives and strengthen work in this direction, fulfilling new specific commitments, and also to establish new partnerships at the regional and global levels”.
The Forum will consist of approximately 80 live sessions, taking place between 9am and 7pm Central European Timezone. 30 discussion rooms will be set up on the platform on top of a host of arts and cultural activities.
All events at the Paris Forum will be digitally broadcasted on the event platform, accessible from June 29th. To interact with panelists, connect with tens of thousands of participants from around the world, ask questions and more, register for the forum now!
The closing date for registration is 27 June 2021 at 23:59 (GMT+2). Please note that only registered attendees will gain access to the Forum's digital platform.
All individuals and organizations making commitments to the Action Coalition and leaders can submit their commitments by 18 June 2021 by filling out a form on a dedicated online platform.

Title: FAO assesses Kazakhstan’s capacity to detect and diagnose animal diseases
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
01 June 2021
NUR-SULTAN – Animal health is an important issue in Central Asia, with livestock being a staple part of the economy. Kazakhstan is not an exception either with its goal to develop a livestock production. Therefore, the ability to prevent, detect, and manage animal diseases is critical to for the sector’s growth, as well as for the intra-regional trade of livestock and related commodities.
As part of a new initiative to create a Central Asia Animal Health Network (CAAHN), FAO has embarked on assessing the surveillance capabilities of these countries. The evaluation has concluded already in Kyrgyzstan and recently in Tajikistan, while Uzbekistan is expected to follow later this year.
In Kazakhstan, despite the COVID-19 restrictions, FAO has managed to conduct field mission to evaluate the country’s animal health surveillance system. This was possible partly due to the support of the Veterinary service of Kazakhstan, which is currently aimed to reform the veterinary system in the framework of the National plan of agriculture development for 2022–2026. The teams provided recommendations with the ultimate aim to reduce animal health threats to livelihoods, food security, and public health in the country and beyond.
The assessment mission in Kazakhstan was conducted using FAO’s Surveillance Evaluation Tool (SET).
“No country has unlimited resources; thus if deciding on allocating budget for improving animal health detection and diagnosis, an up-to-date and comprehensive status overview can point at the gaps and trigger improvements effectively,” said Daniel Beltran-Alcrudo, FAO animal health specialist. “There was a clear need for this.”
“All findings were assessed and discussed with the veterinary authorities,” explained Dinara Imanbayeva, SET evaluator “A comprehensive report with the gaps and recommendations will be shared with the country soon.”
The Surveillance Evaluation Tool requires a series of interviews at national, subnational, and field level, with all actors of the early detection and prevention of animal diseases (such as livestock owners, public veterinarians, field veterinarians, veterinary association, public health, environment protection, and internal affairs representatives) to grade the surveillance system along 90 indicators. Legal frameworks, laboratory analyses, workforce, training, outbreak investigation, and operating procedures have been reviewed, too, for a detailed understanding of the structure, practices, and activities in place in the national and subnational surveillance systems.

Title: Joint Statement by United Nations agencies in Kazakhstan on the occasion of the International Day of the Girl Child
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
09 October 2020
NUR-SULTAN – Annually on 11 October, the International Day of the Girl Child, we celebrate girls in Kazakhstan and everywhere as they are the source of inspiration, energy, and creativity for all of us.
If empowered, they can help build a better future and bring transformative changes. Today girl-led movements are tackling issues like climate change, racial injustice, skills and learning inequality, bring innovations into aerospace engineering and launch nanosatellites into space. This year, while we face the global COVID-19 crisis, we seize the opportunity to join forces and reimagine a better world inspired by girls under the theme “My voice, our equal future." The world where girls feel more empowered and recognized, supported, and invested in.
On 19 December 2011, United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 66/170 to declare 11 October as the International Day of the Girl Child to recognize girls’ rights, highlight the unique challenges they face all over the world and also advocate for the attainment of their basic human rights, like education and bodily autonomy.
25 years ago, at the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the world community adopted the most visionary blueprint for the empowerment of women and girls, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, so today girls can follow the plan and take the actions to build their peaceful and prosperous future. To commemorate the Beijing Declaration UN Women is bringing together the generations of women and girls’ rights defenders into the multigenerational campaign: “Generation Equality”. Clear objectives and actions related to the needs and opportunities of adolescent girls and their solutions are central to the Generation Equality mission.
Girls demand a life free of violence within and outside the home and we have to ensure that. According to the 2015 Kazakhstan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 50% of girls are subjected to violent forms of discipline in the family. Including 21% are subjected to physical violence, 45% are subjected to psychological aggression.
Moreover, COVID-19 has created a new obstacle for girls to equal access to information and education – digital divide. Girls face immense gaps to attain the education and skills they need to compete in a rapidly changing workforce. Gender roles and stereotypes are learned behaviours that start early in life, solidify during adolescence, and influence the kinds of jobs undertaken. Globally, the percentage of females among Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) graduates is below 15% in over two-thirds of countries. To achieve gender equality, girls and young women need equal access to education, technology, digital training and to be safe online.
Empowerment of girls with new skills plays a crucial role in economic development. Aiming to promote STEM education and innovations among girls in Kazakhstan, in 2020 UNICEF and the Science and Technology Park of Al-Farabi Kazakh National University launched an educational project for girls on the development of UniSat nanosatellites. This October 20 girls aged 14 to 35 years from different regions of Kazakhstan will launch the first ready nanosatellite to the stratosphere. This launch proves that the field of nanotechnology, programming and design of spacecraft is open for girls in Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan girls also represent the majority of UN volunteers, who helped youth to overcome the lockdown, provided emotional health support, promoted stress resistance and shared their skills with their peers.
Empowering girls through cultural and creative industries is at the heart of the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions. In this regard UNESCO is launching the #GirlsCreArt2020 online course, dedicated to girls with special needs from all Central Asian countries, with the aim of expanding their opportunities and improving knowledge in certain creative professional sectors.
Today UNFPA is also re-launching “Her Future” project together with singer and activist Kaliya and The Steppe, which aims at raising awareness on gender issues and reproductive health and rights of every girl and woman. This project was created as another effort towards a gender-equal world, one where every girl has the power to make informed choices about her health and her life.
Achievement of gender equality, women and girls’ empowerment is integral for each of 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Through ensuring the rights of women and girls across all the goals we will get to justice and inclusion, economies that work for all, and sustain our shared environment now and for future generations.

17 October 2019
The current Partnership Framework for Development (PFD) between the government of Kazakhstan and UN for 2016-2020 is due to end in December 2020. Therefore, the United Nations agencies, programmes and funds are beginning the planning for the next, post 2020 five-year programming cycle, that is to say an exercise of crafting the new “UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework”.
To ensure that the new Cooperation Framework reflects the priorities of Kazakhstan’s Strategy 2050 and other strategic documents, the UN country team conducted the Strategic Prioritization Retreat on 15-16 October 2019 at Astana Marriot Hotel in Nur-Sultan with participation of key national counterparts. Over 130 participants represented the Government of Kazakhstan, civil society and academia activists.
Together with our national counterparts we reviewed and discussed the development challenges and opportunities for SDG achievement in Kazakhstan while listening to views from the state, Civil Society and UN and discussing and agreeing on the strategic priority areas and defining future “outcomes” of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework 2021-2025 building on those priority areas.

Title: The Government of Kazakhstan, United Nations, Asian Development Bank and World Bank meet to discuss SDGs monitoring and reporting
Content: Donate to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund
26 September 2018
Borovoye, Kazakhstan – Representatives from the Government of Kazakhstan, the United Nations (UN), Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank (WB) met to discuss and further advance the monitoring and reporting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Kazakhstan.
The large-scale event gathered more than 120 delegates from Government, UN agencies, WB, ADB, research institutions and civil society organizations. The main aim was to further contextualize priority indicators for monitoring of the SDGs in Kazakhstan and kick-start the discussion on Voluntary National Review (VNR) preparation on SDGs implementation, which will be presented in July 2019 at the UN’s High Level Political Forum. The meeting was also attended by international statisticians and SDGs specialists providing global and country-specific experience in the SDGs nationalization process, as well as VNR preparation and reporting based on examples of OECD and CIS countries. Discussion on gender and vulnerable population groups as cross-cutting issues was also part of the discussion.
«Kazakhstan supported the Sustainable Development Goals and the priorities set by the Global Agenda fully coincide with the ones of Kazakhstan, outlined in key strategic and policy documents. Also, some of them, for instance, Concept of Family and Gender Policy and Strategic Development Plan till 2025, are endorsed through a lens of SDGs and include corresponding indicators. In this way, Kazakhstan’s development objectives are very much in line with the SDGs, which may serve as a credible political framework for attaining them,”   stated Deputy Chairperson of the Committee on Statistics of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan Mr. Kairat Orunkhanov.
In August this year the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan issued a Resolution announcing the establishment of a nationally led and a nationally owned SDGs coordination architecture. This includes a Coordination Council under the chairpersonship of the Deputy Prime Minister, and five inter-sectoral working groups headed by national coordinators corresponding to 5 P’s of the Sustainable Development agenda (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership).
“Many of the SDGs are already incorporated in Government strategic and political documents however there is a need to further strengthen this process and to ensure that all stakeholders work together on achieving the SDGs, which is a prerequisite to Kazakhstan’s development aspiration, that is to achieve OECD standards,” said the UN Resident Coordinator in Kazakhstan Mr. Norimasa Shimomura.
“ADB is very committed to assist Kazakhstan accomplish its development strategy under the new SDG architecture through nationalization, localization, as well as regional collaboration of the SDG targets. We are keen to work with the Government and other development partners in the organization of the new partnership for sustainable development forum and filling existing gaps through knowledge and investment projects,” stated ADB Country Director for Kazakhstan Mr. Giovanni Capannelli.
­­World leaders adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. The Goals address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, women’s empowerment, inclusiveness for all, education, health, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice.

Bishkek – Today, people who newly became Kyrgyz citizens received national passport at the ceremony organized jointly by the Representation of the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), the Office of the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Government in Osh province, and the Department of Registration of Population and Acts of Civil Status of the State Registration Service under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic.  These people are former stateless persons.
Kyrgyzstan is not unfamiliar with the phenomenon of statelessness.  According to the State Registration Service (SRS) data, more than 50,000 persons had their Kyrgyz citizenship clarified and confirmed between 2010 and 2014.  In 2014, UNHCR and the Kyrgyz Government launched a joint project to address the remaining cases of statelessness with the aim to identify stateless persons and those at risk of statelessness across the country.  As a result, more than 13,000 stateless and persons with undetermined nationality have been registered and nearly 12,000 of them have had their stateless situation resolved as of today.
“Your new passport is more than a document.  It is a proof of your legal connection to the state.  You will be able to move freely, to own property, to receive pension and healthcare, and to register your life events and that of your children such as birth and marriage, and finally to participate in the democratic process”, said Ms. Yasuko Oda, Regional Representative/Regional Coordinator of UNHCR for Central Asia.
While the majority of stateless people have lived in Kyrgyzstan all their lives, some others have become stateless later in life due to legislative gaps and other reasons such as international migration.  Although well integrated in the local society, stateless and undocumented persons face insurmountable obstacles due to their lack of citizenship and identity document when registering marriage and childbirth, traveling abroad, or receiving social benefits such as pensions and health insurance.  The new citizens will finally be able to access to education, healthcare, legal employment, property ownership, political participation, as Kyrgyz citizens.
Attending today’s passport hand-over ceremony with Ms. Muhabat Pratova, Director of the Department for Registration of Population and Civil Acts of the State Registration Service, the Regional Representative of UNHCR Ms. Yasuko Oda congratulated the 15 new citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic:
“Despite advances made in reducing statelessness, millions of people all over the world still live as ”invisible” - without legal identities, and unrecognized as citizens by any state.  I am very pleased that the 15 people received a passport today, and wish to commend the Kyrgyz government’s commitment to addressing this human rights issue.  I very much look forward to our continued partnership with the Kyrgyz authorities for accelerating the efforts further to bring statelessness to a close in near future”.
