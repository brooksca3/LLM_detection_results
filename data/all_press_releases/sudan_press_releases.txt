Title: WFP expands emergency response to avert famine in war-torn Sudan
Content: 06 June 2024
PORT SUDAN – The UN World Food Programme (WFP) is urgently expanding its emergency food and nutrition assistance in war-torn Sudan amid the looming threat of famine, as conditions for civilians deteriorate and fighting intensifies in battle zones like El Fasher and Khartoum.
The UN food agency is scaling up to provide life-saving food and nutrition assistance to an additional 5 million people by the end of this year, doubling the number of people WFP had planned to support at the start of 2024. Hunger is deepening in Sudan and in neighbouring countries to which millions of people have fled, creating a hunger crisis that could become the world’s largest.
“Sudan is in the grip of widespread hunger and malnutrition. WFP continues to expand its food and nutrition assistance to reach millions more people who are living through the daily horrors of war. The situation is already catastrophic and has the potential to worsen further unless support reaches all those affected by conflict,” said Michael Dunford, WFP’s Regional Director for Eastern Africa.
As part of the scale up of assistance, WFP will provide support in cash to 1.2 million people in 12 states. This also gives a vital boost to local markets and food producers. WFP is also increasing how much food or cash it provides to people facing the most severe levels of hunger – more than two million people across more than 40 hunger hotspots identified by WFP. Certain communities in these areas – mostly in regions where fighting is ongoing, like the Darfurs, Kordofans, Khartoum and Gezira – are at a high-risk of slipping into famine-like conditions if they do not receive urgent and sustained support.
“The situation in Sudan is not so much forgotten as neglected. It is already the largest displacement crisis in the world, and it has the potential to become the world’s largest hunger crisis. As global leaders focus elsewhere, it is not receiving the necessary attention and support to avert a nightmare scenario for the people of Sudan. The world cannot claim it doesn’t know how bad the situation is in Sudan or that urgent action is needed,” said Dunford.
WFP is working around the clock to expand access and open new humanitarian corridors to get food supplies moving to communities in all parts of the country – across frontlines from eastern Sudan via Dabbah in Northern State, from Kosti into the Kordofans, and across borders from Chad, Egypt and South Sudan. WFP is also pre-positioning food at key border crossings and along supply routes because the imminent rainy season will make roads in the Darfurs and Kordofans impassable.
Additionally, WFP is working with smallholder farmers, many displaced by conflict, to boost wheat production. The first harvest supported through this programme – financed by the African Development Bank – gave 170,000 farmers climate-adapted wheat seeds and fertilizer, boosting their production by up to 70 percent over the last year and offering them a vital safety net as Sudan’s lean season begins.
Against the backdrop of the ongoing war, humanitarian agencies are struggling to support everyone in need. Food security is drastically deteriorating and could hit levels not seen in Sudan since the early 2000s. Famine-like conditions are caused not only by a lack of food, but also a lack of medical care and clean water – all a devastating reality for Sudan’s population. People in Sudan are resorting to desperate measures like eating grass and wild leaves just to survive. Malnutrition among children in Sudan has also hit shocking levels, leaving an entire generation at risk. Children are already dying of malnutrition-related causes.

Title: Statement attributable to Clementine Nkweta-Salami, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan
Content: 06 June 2024
I am shocked by reports of violent attacks and a high number of casualties in the village of Wad Al-Noura in Aj Jazirah State on 5 June 2024.
While the UN does not yet have the full details and facts of yesterday’s events, there are credible reports of heavy gunfire and the use of explosive weapons in populated civilian areas.
The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have publicly confirmed that their elements were involved in ground operations in this area on 5 June.
Even by the tragic standards of Sudan’s conflict, the images emerging from Wad Al-Noura are heart-breaking.
I have said it before and I will say it again: wars have rules that need to be respected, no matter what.
Armed clashes and the use of explosive weapons in heavily populated areas must be avoided at all costs. Civilians can never be a target.
International Humanitarian Law and commitments made in Jeddah must be upheld.
I call for a thorough investigation into the circumstances and facts of what happened in Wad Al-Noura, and for those responsible of crimes to be held accountable.
Human tragedy has become a hallmark of life in Sudan. We cannot allow impunity to become another one.

Title: Statement by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, on the situation in Al Fasher, North Darfur State
Content: 30 May 2024
Port Sudan – I am profoundly distressed by the humanitarian situation in Al Fasher, where the noose of war is tightening its stranglehold on a civilian population that is under attack from all sides.
Humanity is the first casualty of war. The news of reported casualties and human rights abuses are appalling. Families, including children and elderly people, are being prevented from leaving the city as they search for safety.
We are receiving deeply worrying reports that medical facilities, displacement camps, and critical civilian infrastructure have been targeted by parties to the conflict.
Many parts of Al Fasher have been left without electricity or water. A growing proportion of the population has limited access to basic necessities and essential services, including food and healthcare.
After more than a year of brutal conflict, families have exhausted their scarce resources and their resilience is being eroded with each day of violence.
All parties must avoid using explosive weapons in populated areas and should take all feasible precautions to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure.
Wars have rules that must be respected by all, no matter what.

Title: Sudan's children trapped in critical malnutrition crisis, warn UN agencies
Content: 30 May 2024
GENEVA/NEW YORK/ROME: Three United Nations agencies today issued a stark warning that all indications point to a significant deterioration of the nutrition situation for children and mothers in war-torn Sudan. The lives of Sudan’s children are at stake and urgent action is needed to protect an entire generation from malnutrition, disease and death.
A recent analysis conducted by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UN World Food Programme (WFP) and World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that the ongoing hostilities are worsening the drivers of child malnutrition. These include a lack of access to nutritious food, safe drinking water and sanitation, and increased risk of disease. The situation is compounded by massive population displacement, as large numbers of people flee the conflict. Sudan is facing an ever-increasing risk of conflict-induced famine that will have catastrophic consequences including the loss of life, especially among young children.
The year-long war is also severely impacting the delivery of humanitarian supplies, leaving countless women and children without access to vital food and nutritional support. The agencies have been struggling to deliver nutrition products as growing violence and bureaucratic procedures impede access to conflict affected areas.
Child malnutrition in Sudan is at emergency levels. In Central Darfur, acute malnutrition is estimated to be at 15.6 percent among children under 5, while in ZamZam camp it’s close to 30%. The situation has deteriorated over recent months, with no sign of abating due to continued conflict and severely hindered humanitarian access. Acute malnutrition is life-threatening, with malnourished children up to 11 times more likely to die than a well-nourished child. Malnutrition and disease reinforce each other, with sick children becoming more easily malnourished and malnourished children becoming sick more easily, and suffering worse outcomes. Even when children recover, malnutrition can have lifelong effects on physical and cognitive development. Sudan risks a lost generation, with grave implications for the country’s future.
Levels of malnutrition are particularly worrying among pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. For example, screening carried out last month by Medecins Sans Frontieres in ZamZam camp, North Darfur, found over 33 percent of pregnant and breastfeeding women are malnourished, indicating that they are likely sacrificing their own needs to feed their children. This situation poses an incredible risk not only for the health of mothers, but also for the next generation of Sudan’s children. As much as 30 percent of child malnutrition begins in utero, so children born to malnourished mothers are likely to be already malnourished themselves.
“Children in Sudan are experiencing horrific violence, displacement and trauma – and now they are confronted with potential famine,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “When children suffer from serious forms of malnutrition, it harms their physical and cognitive development and can leave life-long damage. Parties to the conflict must urgently allow humanitarian access so children can receive food, water, medical care and shelter. But most of all, children need peace.”
“Mothers and children across Sudan are wasting away from malnutrition. The ongoing war has stripped them of everything they need to survive – food, medical support and shelter. We need immediate and safe access to deliver the humanitarian assistance that they so desperately need. Without it, this crisis risks becoming the world’s largest hunger emergency”, said WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain. “Millions of lives are at stake and the international community must act now or we risk losing an entire generation of children.”
“Malnutrition is not a one-time crisis. Malnourished children face a lifetime of developmental challenges and ill-health and are also more likely to die from infectious diseases”, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “The clock is ticking, edging Sudan’s mothers and children closer to famine. WHO and partners are on the ground working to prevent and treat acute malnutrition to save precious lives but we need sustained humanitarian access and full financial backing to be able to do this.”
The report acknowledges data gaps due to difficulties in gaining access to conflict hotspots. Despite this, the agencies fear that the situation is extremely critical, and continues to deteriorate. The data gaps in themselves are indicative of a lack of vital humanitarian access in the worst affected areas. All options must be utilized to reach those populations that are the most in need.
Over the coming months the situation for Sudan’s children and mothers will only worsen: the rainy season, which will cut off communities and raise rates of disease, starts in June. Sudan is also entering the lean season, a time between harvests when food stocks traditionally run low. This is particularly pertinent this year, as reports are already indicating that agricultural production in 2023 was below normal, due to insecurity and displacement.
The agencies call for immediate, unimpeded and consistent access to communities who are suffering the worst effects of the brutal and lengthy conflict, through all possible crossline and cross-border routes with neighbouring countries, as well as a de-escalation of the situation in El Fasher and a nationwide ceasefire. We also count on a renewed and significant scaled up support from donors. The window to avert the worst is rapidly closing.

Title: Statement by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta Salami, on the death of an aid worker in Al Fasher, North Darfur State
Content: 26 May 2024
(Port Sudan)
I am deeply saddened by the terrible news of the death of an MSF staff member when shelling hit his house in Al Fasher yesterday.
My thoughts and sympathies are with his family and colleagues during this difficult time.
This tragic incident comes when hundreds of thousands of women, men, and children in North Darfur are once again caught in the crossfire of war.
People in Al Fasher and surrounding areas face a dire humanitarian situation, with conflict affecting every aspect of their daily lives. The number of casualties is rising by the day.
The relentless violence must come to an end. Each innocent life claimed stands as a harrowing testament to the sheer brutality of war.
The brave humanitarians supporting people in need must be protected. International humanitarian law must be respected.
My message to all parties is simple. Stop the fighting. Respect human rights. Allow the safe passage of civilians and humanitarian aid.
A human tragedy of epic proportions is on the horizon, but it can, and must, be prevented.

Title: Small window remains to avert disaster in Sudan's war-torn regions, warns WFP Deputy Executive Director
Content: 15 May 2024
PORT SUDAN/NAIROBI – The UN World Food Programme warns that the window to save lives is closing as famine looms in Sudan’s war-torn regions with civilians trapped by intensified fighting in northern Darfur; the rainy season set to start in the coming month making critical transport routes inaccessible; and as the lean season - when food stocks run out and hunger peaks – hits.
“The situation is desperate and quickly deteriorating. WFP is currently reaching some 2.5 million people. We have the capacity to scale up and expand our assistance, but for that we need all parties to facilitate access – both across the warring front lines, as well as cross-border from Chad and South Sudan,” said WFP’s Deputy Executive Director, Carl Skau following a mission to Sudan this week.
“Only a few weeks remain to stock up food supplies in parts of Darfur and Kordofan before the rainy season starts and many roads become impassible. Farmers also need to safely reach their farmlands to plant ahead of the rains,” he added.
At least 5 million people in Sudan are on the brink of starvation (IPC4). WFP experts warn that number may have significantly increased since the last Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) assessment in December 2023. A preliminary WFP analysis has identified 41 hunger hotspots that are high-risk of slipping into famine (IPC5) in the coming month, most of them in access constrained areas where conflict is raging including in the Darfur and Kordofan region and Khartoum.
In Port Sudan, Deputy Executive Director Skau met with a senior member of the Sudan Sovereignty Council, the Sudan Federal Humanitarian Aid Commissioner, and Sudan’s Minister of Agriculture. They recognized the severity of the situation and committed to facilitate cross-line deliveries, more flexibility in using the Tine border crossing from Chad into North Darfur, and to consider allowing WFP convoys to cross via the currently-closed Adre border crossing. As progress is currently being made with SPLM-N (Al-Hilu) on humanitarian access, facilitation of access to the Kordofan region, including through a cross-border route from South Sudan, is also anticipated.
In addition, commitments were given that the WFP-managed UN Humanitarian Air Service could open an airbridge to Kassala from Port Sudan, and that WFP would be able to bring additional ITC equipment to ensure connectivity for the humanitarian system in remote field locations.
“These indications are welcome steps to improve the humanitarian operating environment in Sudan. Commitments made by all parties to facilitate humanitarian access urgently need to be translated into realities on the ground,” said WFP’s Deputy Executive Director.
Escalating fighting in North Darfur’s capital El Fasher in recent days has resulted in large numbers of civilian deaths and injuries, damaged the only operational hospital in the state, and hampered humanitarian access to the city and beyond.
“I urge the warring parties to uphold their obligations under international law to protect civilians and to stop the fighting,” he added.
WFP has repeatedly been warning that Sudan could become the world’s worst hunger crisis as the conflict enters its second year. The window to prevent famine is rapidly closing without immediate action.
“The situation in Sudan has not been given the attention it deserves. That must change now. Concerted diplomatic efforts and more resources are urgently needed to protect civilians and to strengthen the humanitarian response. WFP is committed and ready to do its part,” WFP Deputy Executive Director said.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General – on Sudan
Content: 13 May 2024
The Secretary-General is gravely concerned by the outbreak of fighting in El Fasher, which puts over 800,000 civilians at risk. He is alarmed by reports of the use of heavy weaponry in densely populated areas, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties, significant displacement and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. He recalls that civilians in the area are already facing a looming famine and the consequences of over a year of war.
The Secretary-General reminds all parties of their obligation under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and calls on them to allow the civilian population to move to safer areas. He also requests that all parties facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to all civilians in need in El Fasher, across Darfur and the Sudan. Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population and willfully impeding humanitarian relief for civilians in need may constitute war crimes.
The Secretary-General urges the parties to immediately stop the fighting and resume ceasefire negotiations without further delay.

Content: 11 May 2024
Statement by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, on the attack in Al Fasher.
I am gravely concerned by the eruption of clashes in Al Fasher despite repeated calls to parties to the conflict to refrain from attacking the city.
I reiterate - the violence threatens the lives of over 800,000 civilians who reside in Al Fasher.
I am equally disturbed by reports of the use of heavy weaponry and attacks in highly populated areas in the city center and the outskirts of Al Fasher, resulting in multiple casualties.
Wounded civilians are being rushed to Al Fasher Hospital. Civilians trying to flee are trapped in fierce fighting.
Already months of escalating violence around the city has hampered the sustained flow of aid and basic commodities, pushing people to the brink of famine. The capacity of health facilities is severely depleted.
It is heartbreaking to see this nightmare unfolding – conflict continuing to spread engulfing large parts of the country.
And again, civilians – men, women and children, paying the highest prices – their lives.
This must stop.
My plea to all parties engaged in the fighting is to uphold their international law obligations to protect civilians and stop the fighting.
The world is watching as this tragedy unfolds.

Title: WFP warns time is running out to prevent starvation in Darfur as violence in El Fasher escalates
Content: 03 May 2024
Port Sudan – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) warns that time is running out to prevent starvation in Darfur as intensifying clashes in North Darfur’s capital El Fasher hinder efforts to deliver vital food assistance into the region.
Civilians in El Fasher and the wider Darfur region are already facing devastating levels of hunger, yet deliveries of food assistance have been intermittent due to fighting and endless bureaucratic hurdles. The latest escalation of violence around El Fasher has halted aid convoys coming from Chad’s Tine border crossing – a recently opened humanitarian corridor that passes through North Darfur’s capital.
Meanwhile, restrictions from the authorities in Port Sudan are preventing WFP from transporting assistance via Adre, the only other viable cross-border corridor from Chad. The route can serve West Darfur and other locations in Central, South and East Darfur. These access constraints are jeopardizing WFP's plans to provide vital assistance to over 700,000 people ahead of the rainy season when many roads across Darfur become impassable.
“Our calls for humanitarian access to conflict hotspots in Sudan have never been more critical: WFP urgently requires unrestricted access and security guarantees to deliver assistance to the families struggling for survival amid devastating levels of violence. We must be able to use the Adre border crossing and move assistance across frontlines from Port Sudan so we can reach people throughout the Darfur region,” said Michael Dunford, WFP’s Regional Director for Eastern Africa.
The recent surge in violence in El Fasher is exacerbating critical humanitarian needs in Darfur, where at least 1.7 million people are already experiencing emergency levels of hunger (IPC4). El Fasher had been a relative safe-haven for families, hosting many IDP camps that pre-date the current conflict. Yet conditions were already critical with reports of children dying of malnutrition.
Now many are being forced to flee El Fasher and surrounding areas – some for the second or third time – and are becoming increasingly vulnerable. On top of the impact of the escalating violence, WFP is concerned that hunger will increase dramatically as the lean season between harvests sets in and people run out of food.
“The situation is dire. People are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells. If assistance doesn't reach them soon, we risk witnessing widespread starvation and death in Darfur and across other conflict-affected areas in Sudan," said Dunford.
Over the last six weeks, WFP has delivered emergency food and nutrition assistance to over 300,000 people in North, West, and Central Darfur using the Tine and Adre border crossings and a crossline route from Port Sudan. These breakthroughs followed lengthy negotiations. But the progress appears to have been short-lived with all routes now blocked. WFP and the rest of the humanitarian community needs to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance consistently and at scale to prevent a worsening of the crisis.
One year of conflict in Sudan has created an unprecedented hunger catastrophe and threatens to ignite the world’s largest hunger crisis. With almost 28 million people facing acute food insecurity across Sudan, South Sudan, and Chad, the conflict is spilling over and exacerbating the challenges already faced by its neighbours. The window to avert the worst is rapidly closing. A concerted diplomatic effort by the international community is needed to push the warring parties to provide access and safety guarantees and adhere to their obligations under International Humanitarian Law.

Content: 26 April 2024
We are receiving increasingly alarming reports of a dramatic escalation of tensions between armed actors in El Fasher, North Darfur.
The Rapid Support Forces are reportedly encircling El Fasher, suggesting a coordinated move to attack the city may be imminent. Simultaneously, the Sudanese Armed Forces appear to be positioning themselves.
An attack on the city would have devastating consequences for the civilian population. This escalation of tensions is in an area already on the brink of famine.
The Secretary-General reiterates his call on all Parties to refrain from fighting in the El Fasher area.
The Secretary-General's Personal Envoy, Ramtane Lamamra, is engaging with the Parties to de-escalate tensions in El Fasher.

Title: Türk expresses grave concern at escalating violence in El-Fasher
Content: 26 April 2024
Spokespeople for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Seif Magango
Nairobi
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk is gravely concerned by the escalating violence in and around El-Fasher city, North Darfur, where dozens of people have been killed in the past two weeks as hostilities between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have intensified. Reports indicate that both parties have launched indiscriminate attacks using explosive weapons with wide-area effects, such as mortar shells and rockets fired from fighter jets, in residential districts.
At least 43 people, among them women and children, were killed as fighting was taking place between the SAF and RSF – backed by their respective allied militia – since 14 April, when the RSF began its push into El-Fasher.
Civilians are trapped in the city, the only one in Darfur still in the hands of the SAF, afraid of being killed should they attempt to flee. This dire situation is compounded by a severe shortage of essential supplies as deliveries of commercial goods and humanitarian aid have been heavily constrained by the fighting, and delivery trucks are unable to freely transit through RSF-controlled territory.
Since early April, the RSF has conducted several large-scale attacks on the villages in western El-Fasher mostly inhabited by the African Zaghawa ethnic community. RSF has burned down some of the villages, including Durma, Umoshosh, Sarafaya, and Ozbani. Such attacks raise the spectre of further ethnically motivated violence in Darfur, including mass killings. Last year fighting and attacks between the Rizeigat and the African Masalit in West Darfur left hundreds of civilians dead or injured, and thousands displaced from their homes.
The High Commissioner calls for an immediate de-escalation of this catastrophic situation, and an end to the conflict that has ravaged the country for more than a year now. He also calls for an investigation into all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law with a view to ensuring accountability and victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparations. He urges both parties to the conflict and their allies to grant civilians safe passage to other areas, ensure the protection of civilians and civilian objects, and facilitate safe and unhindered humanitarian access.

Title: Scourge of sexual violence amid ongoing conflict demands urgent response
Content: 25 April 2024
Joint Statement by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, and Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, Joyce Msuya
NEW YORK: After one year of hostilities in Sudan, we are appealing for more international engagement to combat sexual violence against women and girls in the country. These barbaric acts, which echo the horrors witnessed in Darfur two decades ago, must spur immediate action.
As members of the Security Council meet this week for the annual open debate on conflict-related sexual violence, we urge them to send an unequivocal message: Under international humanitarian law, civilians in Sudan must be protected and must never be subjected to acts of sexual violence, which constitute war crimes.
Reports of sexual violence reveal the war's disproportionate impact on women and girls. Allegations of rape, forced marriages, sexual slavery, and trafficking of women and girls -- especially in Khartoum, Darfur and Kordofan -- continue to be recorded. Millions of civilians are especially at risk as they flee conflict areas in search of shelter, inside Sudan and in neighbouring countries.
However, the true scale of this crisis remains unseen, a result of severe underreporting due to stigma, fear of reprisals, and a lack of confidence in national institutions.
Without increased political and financial support for the vital work of frontline responders -- especially organisations led by women -- access to life-saving services will only continue to shrink. Fully funding this year's Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan for Sudan -- currently only 10 per cent funded -- will help to support survivors, while bolstering the United Nations' Conflict-Related Sexual Violence Multi-Partner Trust Fund is essential to strengthen the response.
Building on the solidarity demonstrated at last week's International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and its Neighbours in Paris, we must continue to shore up our support for the people of Sudan -- critically by combating sexual violence in all its forms and ensuring that Sudanese frontline responders stay at the centre of those efforts.

Title: IOM: 20,000 People Displaced Daily One Year into Sudan War, IOM Urges Action
Content: 15 April 2024
Geneva/ Port Sudan – A staggering 20,000 people are forced to flee their homes in Sudan each day, half of them children, according to a new report by the International Organization for Migration’s (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).
The report shows that 53 per cent of those displaced are children under 18, highlighting the vulnerability and immense challenges faced by the younger generation who are often the most affected by conflicts and displacement.
More than 8.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes over the past year as fighting spreads in the country including many who were previously displaced multiple times.
“Sudan is on a tragically fast track to becoming one of the world's biggest humanitarian crises in decades, and the conflict that has engulfed the country is creating pressure throughout the region. Millions of people are displaced, hungry and vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, but their plight is being ignored by too much of the world,” said IOM Director General Amy Pope in Paris where she is attending the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and its Neighbours.
“We implore international leaders to rise to the moment, help us bring humanitarian aid to Sudan and use their influence to help bring peace.”
As the war in Sudan enters its second year, IOM urges stronger international action to bring the fighting to an end and significantly boost funding for humanitarian operations to respond to the mounting needs.
The situation in Sudan, already the largest internal displacement crisis globally, is further worsened by the critically underfunded humanitarian response. Only 5 percent of the USD 2.7 billion Humanitarian Response Plan seeking to reach 14.7 million people has been secured. This shortfall risks further deterioration of the humanitarian situation.
Since war broke out, 6.6 million people have been forcibly displaced within Sudan. The war has also disrupted economic activity and cut supply and aid lines, leading to food insecurity of a massive scale with about 5 million people on the brink of famine.
The massive influx of people seeking safety from the horrors of war is putting incredible strain on infrastructure and services, exacerbating food shortages further. Women and girls are facing increased risks of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation, and access to food.
Humanitarians have been facing immense challenges in accessing communities in need, especially in heavy fighting zones in Khartoum, Darfur, Kordofan and Aj-Jazirah, further exacerbating needs and difficulties.
In neighbouring countries where some 2 million people have crossed from Sudan, the crisis is severely straining states’ capacities to cope with the inflows of refugees, returnees and third-country nationals. So far, the number of arrivals in the neighbouring countries include 730,550 in Chad, 629,902 in South Sudan, 514,827 in Egypt, 119,525 in Ethiopia, 29,444 in the Central Africa Republic, and 7,620 in Libya.
IOM continues to deliver immediate and life-saving assistance. To date, IOM has reached over 2 million people in need with essential multisectoral assistance across Sudan and neighbouring countries, including over 1.6 million inside Sudan.
IOM calls for increased humanitarian funding to meet the growing needs and to ensure the delivery of life-saving assistance and essential services to the displaced individuals and host communities. Additionally, efforts should be made to strengthen resilience, build local capacities, promote Peace and durable solutions for the affected populations.

Title: Sudan at the Threshold of Catastrophe Beyond Repair, IOM Chief
Content: 15 April 2024
STATEMENT
Amy Pope | Director General, International Organization for Migration
Geneva/Paris,15 April - A year ago, war came to Khadim, a mother of seven children in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, and she fled 200 kilometers southeast to Medani. And then war came to Khadim in a literal sense: a firefight erupted in Medani and she was caught in the crossfire, shot in the shoulder. To get proper medical attention, Khadim and her family trekked another 240 km further east to Gedaref.
And there Khadim and her family remain, sleeping at night on the ground, in a camp for people displaced by a crisis the world has forgotten.
The current conflict in Sudan began in April 2023, and Khadim and her family are among 8.6 million people displaced by the fighting, one of the biggest displacement crises since World War II. They are also among the 25 million people – more than half of Sudan’s total population – who need humanitarian assistance.
Yet despite the obvious and well-documented need, humanitarian agencies have received just 5 percent of the funds essential to prevent further catastrophe in Sudan this year.
But this crisis is not just about numbers. Within Sudan and across neighboring countries, lives have been shattered and families torn apart. As the fighting spreads, food insecurity is on the rise, health is deteriorating, and abuse and exploitation persist with seeming impunity. These are the consequences of the war in Sudan.
In Paris today, a humanitarian conference gives the international community an opportunity to begin to rectify this situation, to restore the promise of humanity. Aid agencies, including the International Organization for Migration, will present their cases to donor governments, and ask them to help alleviate one of the worst humanitarian crises the world has seen in recent memory.
The sad reality is that the world often reacts to crises far too late, and without financial support from countries all over world, the needs in Sudan are only going to deepen and be more costly. Shelter, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene are among the basics, but so are health and education services, mental health and psychosocial support. We also must do more to provide help and protection to the many survivors of the rampant exploitation and abuse that is one of the effects of this war.
And because the conflict keeps widening, countries that border Sudan also need help. About 2 million people, most of them Sudanese citizens, have migrated away from the worst parts of the Sudan conflict into neighboring countries. This has stressed the capacity of those countries, and especially the communities directly at the borders. We need to ensure that Sudan’s neighbors and the host communities can provide essential services to those coming in.
Without humanitarian assistance, more people impacted by this conflict are going to be displaced, and more will take dangerous risks to cross borders in desperation.
Even with proper funding for our work in Sudan, we are under no illusions that the work will be easy. Humanitarians in Sudan are often targeted by warring parties, and the warehouses and offices of U.N. agencies and aid groups have been looted. Reaching the people who need help is also extremely difficult. In hotspots like Darfur, Khartoum, Aj Jazirah and the Kordofan states, getting help to those who desperately need it has often been close to impossible.
Yet helping people is our job, so we stay and deliver as much as we can. Humanitarian agencies work to ensure that the people of Sudan have not been forgotten that the world is willing to and wants to help.
Beyond the funding, what we need most of all, as we do in so many other parts of the world, is peace.  All of us in the humanitarian community ask this of every leader, of anyone who can influence warring parties: people are suffering, their lives are in the balance. Please seek peace.

Title: Sudan: After one year of war will the world act before it's too late?
Content: 15 April 2024
by Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Chief
It is impossible to overstate what is at stake as the international community convenes tomorrow in Paris for a humanitarian conference on Sudan exactly one year after conflict erupted:
The future of Africa’s third-largest country is being strangled by war.
The survival of millions of children, women and men hangs in the balance as a possible famine and the lean season loom.
The stability of an entire region, already hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees, is under threat.
And the moral integrity of the world at large is being questioned against the backdrop of the atrocities that we failed to stop two decades ago in Darfur.
As I said three months after Sudan’s current conflict broke out, the international community cannot ignore this harsh echo of history. But that is exactly what has happened. Somehow, we have forgotten what should have been unforgettable.
And the consequences of that are unforgivable.
To put it bluntly, our inattention has emboldened the parties to this conflict to flout the basic rules of war. We have seen people gunned down while trying to flee. Children killed. Women raped. Hospitals targeted.
On our watch, two generals have unleashed a conflict that has driven more than 8 million people, mostly women and children, from their homes. It has stoked ethnic violence and disease, and extinguished lives and livelihoods. It has collapsed the pillars of society – healthcare, education, agriculture – and left half the population, some 25 million people, in need of aid.
This is the toll of a year of war. Sudan must not endure another one.
So we must grasp this moment for what it is: a reckoning, and a chance to redouble our efforts to achieve three key objectives.
Let me start with one that is completely within our collective power: a fully funded humanitarian response.
By hosting the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and its Neighbours, France, Germany and the European Union have given us a platform for action on this front, and there is no time to lose. Our humanitarian appeal for this year is only 6 per cent funded. Of the $2.7 billion we need to help 15 million of the most vulnerable people in Sudan, we have just over $155 million. The international community can prevent famine from taking hold in Sudan – but only with immediate action. I urge countries to pledge generously, and then deliver.
A second objective is something that is, admittedly, much more challenging: an immediate cessation of hostilities.
Ramadan has come and gone with no halt to the fighting, despite a flurry of calls by the UN Secretary-General, Security Council and countless other leaders and bodies for a truce during the holy month. Clearly, we need a surge in diplomacy to achieve a ceasefire – and sooner rather than later, a negotiated political solution to the conflict.
We know the latter will not happen overnight. In the meantime, we need those with influence over the parties to this conflict to compel them to abide by the Declaration of Commitments they signed 11 months ago in Jeddah. Both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces pledged there and then to protect civilians and facilitate the passage of aid, but they have largely failed to follow through.
Which brings me to a third and final objective – something that we should not have to beg for: safe and unfettered humanitarian access. In the past year, more than 20 aid workers have been killed in Sudan, and tens of thousands of tons of supplies looted. The humanitarian community – first and foremost, local organizations and courageous front-line volunteers – are keeping aid operations going, ceasefire or not. But we could do far more if the parties were to commit to sustained humanitarian dialogue to unlock access and unblock deliveries.
What we need, plain and simple, is to be able to reach people in need, wherever they are, via all possible routes, whether across borders or conflict lines. The vast majority of the nearly 5 million people staring down a possible famine in the months ahead live in parts of Sudan that are the most difficult for us to access: Darfur, Kordofan, Khartoum and Aj Jazirah. Preventing aid from getting there is condemning them to starvation.
Their future depends on all of us keeping up the pressure to deliver on these three priorities. To lapse into inattention once again, into forgetting, would send the message that we don’t care.
For the international community, it is time to shoulder our responsibility. The conference in Paris must translate into tangible outcomes: more access for humanitarians, more funding for the response, and more diplomacy for an end to this war.
And for the parties to the conflict and their backers, it is time to face facts. You are making Sudan unlivable. Your pursuit of power and resources is fueling hunger, displacement and disease. Silence the guns now.
After one year of war, there must be a light at the end of this tunnel of darkness and death. Millions of people in Sudan have already lost their homes, their livelihoods and their loved ones. We cannot let them lose hope, too.

Title: UN Women: A year of suffering for Sudanese women and girls
Content: 15 April 2024
UN Women calls on the international community to ensure that the conflict in Sudan does not become a neglected crisis
Sudan’s current conflict, which marks its one year point this week, is having a devastating impact on the people of Sudan, particularly women and girls. The conflict has reversed the gains made toward democracy and stability, leaving the country in suffering and insecurity, while facing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
Sudanese women and girls are paying a heavy price for this violence, bearing the brunt of a humanitarian crisis that remains largely invisible to the world. Sudan is among the largest internal displacement crises in the world. 53 per cent of internally displaced are women and girls, and there is a growing risk that the violence will soon create the world’s largest hunger crisis. More than 7,000 new mothers could die in the coming months if their nutritional and health needs remain unmet.
Over 6.7 million people are at risk of gender-based violence and reports of intimate partner violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and trafficking in persons are widespread and increasing. Survivors report rarely able to access services or report to authorities. The economic impact of the conflict has further marginalized women, stripping them of livelihood opportunities and pushing many towards severe measures and the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse as they seek to support their families.
Women and girls, often the first responders in crises, are not only victims of this violence but also pivotal to the survival and resilience of their communities. UN Women salutes the courage and bravery of Sudanese women and women’s rights organizations, who continue to advocate for peace and a return to democratic governance at different fora. Their participation in peace processes and humanitarian responses is not just beneficial but necessary for creating lasting peace and security.
UN Women calls on the international community to ensure that the conflict in Sudan does not become a neglected crisis. Immediate steps must be taken to ensure the protection of women and girls, support their economic empowerment, and include them in peace negotiations and decision-making. We urge international partners and donors to invest in local, women-led organizations and prioritize resources to address the gender dimensions of this crisis.
UN Women stands with the people of Sudan during this difficult time and reiterates the Secretary-General's call for an immediate halt to the fighting and a return to dialogue. Respect for human rights and international law must prevail, with perpetrators of human rights violations held accountable. Only then can we hope to restore democracy and build a peaceful and secure future for all in Sudan.

Title: Statement by the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, to mark one year of conflict
Content: 15 April 2024
(Paris): Today marks one year since brutal fighting erupted in Sudan. Over the last year, Sudan has become one of the world’s worst humanitarian tragedies in recent memory and one of the largest internal displacement crises globally. Famine now looms.
Half of Sudan’s population - 25 million people - need humanitarian assistance; 8.6 million people are displaced inside and outside Sudan, including 4 million children; and over 14,000 women, men, and children have reportedly been killed. Nearly 5 million people are one step away from famine and 18 million people are facing acute food insecurity - 10 million more people than the same time last year. Yet, these numbers do not adequately capture the scope of the devastation caused by the war. The longer the fighting continues, the worse the tragedy gets. As we mark one year of the devastating conflict, I reiterate the unwavering commitment of the humanitarian community to assist all people affected by the crisis. The continuing violence is out of hand. The suffering of millions of people in Sudan needs to end once and for all. I welcome ongoing efforts towards a ceasefire, but I reiterate that all parties must abide by the agreements they made in Jeddah and commit to long-lasting peace. In particular, I ask the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to protect civilians and allow unfettered humanitarian access so that people in desperate need can receive the lifesaving assistance that they require. Despite an extremely difficult and dangerous operating environment, United Nations agencies and their partners have reached more than 8 million people with lifesaving assistance over the last year. In 2024, humanitarian partners have appealed for US$4.1 billion through the 2024 Sudan Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan and the 2024 Sudan Refuge Response Plan to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs in Sudan and neighbouring countries that have been kind enough to host large populations of Sudanese refugees. So far, only 6 per cent of the funding required for the 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan has been received. I urge the international community not to forget the people of Sudan whose lives have been ripped apart by the war. Additional resources are urgently required to support a humanitarian response that has been significantly underfunded since the start of the current conflict. This includes resources for the Sudan Famine Prevention Plan 2024 which was published on 12 April.

Title: OHCHR: One year on, Türk warns of further escalation
Content: 15 April 2024
GENEVA (15 April 2024) – On the first anniversary the outbreak of the armed conflict in Sudan, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk warned of a further escalation in violence as parties to the conflict arm civilians, and more armed groups join the fighting.
“The Sudanese people have been subjected to untold suffering during the conflict which has been marked by indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas, ethnically-motivated attacks, and a high incidence of conflict-related sexual violence. The recruitment and use of children by parties to the conflict are also deeply concerning,” said Türk.
“Civilians have already suffered immensely and with reports over the weekend of an imminent attack on El-Fasher, North Darfur, there is an alarming risk of further violations and abuses against civilians amid a still worsening humanitarian crisis across the country. The fighting must end.”
Three armed groups have said they are joining the conflict on the side of the Sudanese Armed Forces, and there are reports that both they and the Rapid Support Forces are now arming civilians. Arrest warrants recently issued against leading civilian figures, including former Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, on charges that do not appear to be substantiated and some of which carry the death penalty, also risk exacerbating the situation.
“To give a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict a chance, a contraction rather than an expansion in the number of armed actors is needed,” said Türk.
“Additionally, any moves to curtail the participation of civilian political leaders in the conduct of public affairs, including by threat of arrest, are counterproductive and must be abandoned.
“The Sudanese authorities must immediately revoke the arrest warrants against Hamdok and other civilian leaders and prioritize confidence-building measures towards a ceasefire as a first step, followed by a comprehensive resolution of the conflict and the restoration of a civilian government,” he added.
Since fighting broke out on 15 April 2023, thousands of civilians have been killed, injured, forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily arrested and detained. There have also been reports of torture committed by both parties. Thousands of homes, schools, hospitals, and other essential civilian infrastructure have been destroyed, plunging the country into a severe humanitarian crisis, and creating the world’s largest displacement crisis.
“Over eight million people have been displaced from their homes, more than two million of them to neighbouring countries. Nearly 18 million people face acute food insecurity, 14 million of them children, and over 70 percent of hospitals are no longer functional amid a rise in infectious diseases. This catastrophic situation must not be allowed to continue,” said the High Commissioner.
Türk called on all parties to ensure humanitarian and human rights workers are allowed safe and unhindered access to all areas under their respective control. They must also take meaningful steps to prevent further civilian suffering and ensure violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws are fully investigated and those found responsible held to account in fair trials and victims provided with reparations.
The High Commissioner decried the enduring pattern of arbitrary arrests and detention, as well as intimidation and threats against civil society representatives, human rights defenders and journalists, among others.
“There can be no sustainable pathway forward for Sudan without the participation of civil society organizations, who notably have done a commendable job in support of human rights under exceedingly difficult circumstances since the conflict began,” he said.
Türk urged all parties to cooperate with the Designated Expert on the human rights situation in Sudan, Radhouane Nouicer, and the Fact-Finding Mission established by the UN Human Rights Council. Sudanese authorities should grant them access to Sudan.

Title: UNICEF: An entire generation of children in Sudan faces a catastrophe as the war enters its second year
Content: 14 April 2024
NEW YORK/PARIS/PORT SUDAN – One year since violence exploded in Sudan, and as the ensuing crisis continues to deepen, the lives, educations and futures of a generation of Sudanese children hang in the balance.  Beyond the direct impact of the violence on children, the ongoing war has fueled a lethal combination of displacement, disease outbreaks and hunger. Almost 4 million children under five are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition this year, including 730,000 projected to suffer from life-threatening severe acute malnutrition. Sudan now has one of the worst education crises in the world, with more than 90 per cent of the country's 19 million school-age children having no access to formal education. The ongoing disruption to education will result in a generational crisis for Sudan.
“This brutal war and potential famine is creating an ominous environment for a catastrophic loss of children’s lives,” said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Ted Chaiban. “Almost half of the children suffering from severe acute malnutrition are in areas that are hard to access, where there is ongoing fighting, making their conditions all the more dire. This is all avoidable, and we can save lives if all parties to the conflict allow us to access communities in need and to fulfil our humanitarian mandate – without politicizing aid.”  Hunger and malnutrition make children much more vulnerable to disease and death. With vaccination coverage dropping significantly due to the fighting, hundreds of thousands of children lacking access to safe drinking water, and significant access issues due to theviolence, ongoing disease outbreaks such as cholera, measles, malaria, and dengue threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. Spikes in mortality, especially among internally displaced children, are a forewarning of a possible huge loss of life, as the country enters the annual lean season.   Ensuring predictable and sustainable access to vulnerable populations is critical to preventing catastrophic hunger and famine. Meanwhile, basic systems and social services in Sudan are on the brink of collapse, with frontline workers not being paid for a year, vital supplies depleted, and infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, still under attack. Children and families’ access to health, nutrition, water, and sanitation hangs by a thread, further compounding the crisis.
The ongoing hostilities have resulted in a five-fold increase in reports of grave violations of children’s rights from 2022 to 2023, especially the recruitment and use of children by armed forces and armed groups, killing, maiming, and sexual violence against children. 2023 saw the highest number of grave child rights violations verified in Sudan in more than a decade. True figures are likely to be far higher than those reported given the extreme difficulties to verify violations due to access issues.  Sudan has also become the world’s largest child displacement crisis, with over 4 million children forced from their homes since April 2023, including nearly 1 million children crossing into neighboring countries, particularly to Chad, Egypt, and South Sudan. Many refugees and returnees are arriving in areas that were already home to vulnerable and underserved communities, struggling with multiple emergencies and crises.
“The scale of needs is so staggering that it’s hard to put into perspective- but let us not forget these are not just numbers,” said Chaiban. “These numbers represent millions of children with names, stories, hopes and dreams. Yet without significant scale up of critical life-saving services, a reopening of schools, and most fundamentally an end to the war, these hopes and dreams will be lost for a generation and for the future of Sudan.”  UNICEF is providing essential, life-saving services in child protection, gender-based violence, health, nutrition, WASH, education and cash support to the most vulnerable children and families. UNICEF is urgently asking for $240 million for the next 6 months to prevent famine in the 93 most vulnerable localities in Sudan, home to 3.5 million children under 5 years of age.
“After 365 days of conflict, the children of Sudan remain at the sharp end of a horrific war. Without urgent concerted action and additional resources, the country risks a generational catastrophe that will have grave implications for the country, the region and beyond,” said Chaiban. “If immediate steps are not taken to halt the violence, facilitate humanitarian access, and provide life-saving aid to those in need, an even worse catastrophe is likely to impact children for many years to come.”

Title: WFP: Economic fallout of Sudan war deepens hunger crisis for millions
Content: 13 April 2024
PORT SUDAN – Sudan’s war has claimed thousands of lives, forced millions from their homes, and sparked economic turmoil across the region that is deepening the hunger crisis, warns the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) as the conflict approaches its one-year mark.
In Sudan, areas of agricultural land have turned into battlegrounds, while farms and businesses stand abandoned as people have fled for safety. There are huge cash shortages nationwide, and repeated cuts to communication channels hinder efforts to keep commerce going. Food prices in Sudan are 73 percent higher than last year and 350 percent above the five-year averages, exacerbated by the currency's devaluation. The ripple effects are felt in South Sudan and Chad where disrupted trade and massive population displacements are straining resources and intensifying hunger.
“Millions of people in Sudan, South Sudan and Chad are being threatened by starvation because this war has laid waste to agriculture, businesses and national economies – leaving its victims hungry and penniless,” said WFP’s Executive Director Cindy McCain. “The fighting must stop now, or the region may soon become the world’s largest hunger crisis.”
The lean season in Sudan is just around the corner. It is starting earlier and expected to run for longer because the war has severely limited the last harvest season. A crop assessment conducted by FAO shows national cereal production at 46 percent below 2023 levels and 40 percent below the five-year average as the conflict has destroyed swathes of farmland, both directly as well as indirectly by forcing farmers from their land. Meanwhile, fertilizers and fuel have become unaffordable for those farmers who can still tend their fields.
Sudan will be unable to finance the import of sufficient food stocks to cover the shortfall. Last year alone, the price of staple grains doubled and is expected to rise further because of the latest poor harvest. This will lead to even more severe food shortages during the lean season, with a devastating impact for the millions of people who are already struggling with record levels of hunger, disease, and malnutrition
South Sudan’s economy is plummeting as families grapple with hyperinflation and extreme currency depreciation, driven in part by a rupture in the country’s main oil export pipeline that runs through Sudan in March. Oil is the main source of revenue for South Sudan. Meanwhile, cross-border trade from Sudan – a lifeline for landlocked South Sudan – has come close to a standstill since the onset of the war.
This economic turmoil risks pushing one million people into severe food insecurity in South Sudan, where already over half the population – 7.1 million people – are acutely hungry, new modelling from WFP shows. Food prices have more than doubled in some areas and around four in five households in South Sudan may be unable to afford food essentials.
A similar scenario is playing out in Chad, where food prices in the east have nearly doubled in the last year. Border closures have severely restricted trade and the availability of food in the markets. Nearly half of all refugees and returnees in eastern Chad are facing acute hunger as the lean season approaches.
With fighting only intensifying, the trajectory of Sudan’s war remains deeply alarming: it will trigger the world’s largest hunger emergency as the impacts of the conflict reverberating around the entire region There are 28 million already food insecure people across Sudan, South Sudan, and Chad who will slip into even deeper and more severe levels of hunger.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - on Sudan

The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by the escalation in tensions between armed actors in El Fasher, North Darfur, an area already on the brink of famine. There are alarming reports indicating that an attack on El Fasher may be imminent. Such an attack would be devastating for civilians in the city and could lead to an expansion of the conflict along intercommunal lines across the five Darfur states. El Fasher is a humanitarian hub for the United Nations that ensures lifesaving assistance is distributed across the five Darfur states in accordance with needs. The Secretary-General reiterates his call for an immediate ceasefire and a durable cessation of hostilities. He also calls on the Parties to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law to protect civilians and facilitate full and unrestricted humanitarian access to all areas in need.  The United Nations remains committed to supporting international mediation efforts and to working with all relevant stakeholders to help bring an end to the war. The Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Ramtane Lamamra, is continuing his engagement to advance peace efforts in Sudan.

Title: Statement by UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem as war in Sudan reaches on year mark
Content: 13 April 2024
Famine is bearing down as war in Sudan reaches one year mark
Famine is bearing down on the women and girls of Sudan as the deadly conflict reaches its one year mark. The war has triggered one of the world’s worst hunger crises, with 1.2 million pregnant and breastfeeding women facing acute malnutrition, robbing them and their newborns of health and potentially even life.
In the three hardest-hit areas of Darfur, Khartoum and Kordofan, more than 7,000 new mothers will die of famine in the coming weeks if they cannot access emergency assistance.
Armed men have shown a total disregard for human life, perpetuating heinous acts of sexual violence as they wage a war on the bodies of women and girls. Just when women need health and protection services the most, these services have all but broken down in conflict-affected areas.
This is the scourge of war on women and girls: extreme food insecurity, the horror of sexual violence, uncertainty and fear. This climate of fear has driven the world’s largest internal displacement crisis with 6.6 million displaced inside Sudan, and a further 2 million forced to flee to neighbouring countries.
Amid this suffering, UNFPA is working with partners to deliver reproductive health services to women and girls in need and to prevent and respond to gender-based-violence. Our medical and protection teams are running 33 mobile clinics and 64 safe spaces across the country. Along with other aid agencies, we are desperately trying to scale up further, but we need safe, unimpeded humanitarian access to do so.
We must stop the suffering of the Sudanese people. Pregnant women and new mothers need urgent help now.
We call for an end to the destruction and looting of civilian infrastructure, including health facilities and equipment.
We need to hold perpetrators of sexual violence to account for their crimes so that justice can be served.
We call on partners to fully fund the humanitarian response plan in Sudan so that we can bring a glimmer of hope to women, girls and their families.
Women and girls in Sudan have already endured too much. To bring an end to their suffering, what they need more than anything is peace.

Title: WFP: First food aid in months reaches Darfur, yet limited humanitarian access is worsening Sudan's hunger catastrophe
Content: 05 April 2024
PORT SUDAN – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has managed to bring desperately needed food and nutrition supplies into Darfur, the first WFP assistance to reach the war-wracked region in months. Yet, the UN food agency warns that unless the people of Sudan receive a constant flow of aid via all possible humanitarian corridors – from neighbouring countries and across battle lines – the country’s hunger catastrophe will only worsen.
Two convoys crossed the border from Chad into Darfur in late March, carrying food and nutrition assistance for around 250,000 people facing acute hunger in North, West and Central Darfur. These are the first cross-border convoys of WFP assistance to reach Darfur following lengthy negotiations to reopen these routes after the authorities in Port Sudan revoked permissions for humanitarian corridors from Chad in February.
The temporary halt of the humanitarian corridor from Chad as well as ongoing fighting, lengthy clearance processes for humanitarian cargo, bureaucratic impediments, and security threats have made it impossible for humanitarians to operate at the scale needed to meet the hunger needs in Sudan.
“We need aid to be consistently reaching war-ravaged communities through every possible route. Hunger in Sudan will only increase as the lean season starts in just a few weeks. I fear that we will see unprecedented levels of starvation and malnutrition sweep across Sudan this lean season,” said WFP Representative and Country Director in Sudan, Eddie Rowe.
Last week, 37 trucks carrying 1,300 metric tons of supplies crossed into West Darfur from Adre in Chad and food distributions are underway in West and Central Darfur. But WFP has no clarity as to when the next aid convoy can travel via this route, which is vital if the humanitarian community stands a chance of preventing widespread starvation in West Darfur. Last year, WFP supported 1 million people in West and Central Darfur with food transported via Chad’s Adre crossing.
Another 16 trucks with around 580 metric tons of supplies entered North Darfur from Chad’s Tina border crossing on 23rd March, while six trucks with 260 metric tons of food reached the area from Port Sudan a few days later – the first aid delivery to be transported across conflict lines in six months. Yet, fierce fighting, lack of security, and lengthy clearances by the warring parties, have led to delays in the distribution of this assistance to people in need.
“WFP and our partners urgently need security guarantees so supplies in North Darfur can be distributed to people who are struggling to find even one basic meal a day. Cross-border operations from Chad to Darfur are critical to reach communities where children are already dying of malnutrition. All corridors to transport food must remain open, particularly the one from Adre in Chad to West Darfur where levels of hunger are alarming,” said Rowe.
Sudan’s war is driving hunger to record levels, with 18 million people across the country facing acute hunger. In Darfur, 1.7 million people are in emergency levels of hunger (IPC4).
Last month, WFP’s Executive Director Cindy McCain warned that the war in Sudan risks triggering the world’s worst hunger crisis unless families in Sudan and those who have fled to South Sudan and Chad receive desperately needed food assistance. This requires unfettered access, faster clearance processes, and funds to deliver a humanitarian response that meets the huge needs of civilians impacted by Sudan’s devastating war.

Title: WHO: Delivering over 50 metric tons of medical supplies to the Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains in Sudan
Content: 03 April 2024
The ongoing crisis in Sudan has significantly impeded the ability of the WHO office in Sudan to access and deliver essential emergency medical supplies to the regions of the Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains.
Due to the limited access and operational capacity in Sudan, the WHO Country Office in Sudan collaborated with WHO South Sudan office to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian commodities from South Sudan and provide the necessary support.
In response to these critical needs, the World Health Organization offices in South Sudan and Sudan collaborated to provide emergency medical supplies to those affected. By leveraging the WHO South Sudan office's logistical prowess, expertise, and available resources, WHO South Sudan prepositioned the requisite quantities of emergency health kits from existing stockpiles in areas adjacent to the Sudan-South Sudan border, ensuring timely and effective assistance to those in dire need. This joint effort was a testament to the commitment of both offices to cross-border collaboration in addressing critical health issues.
These kits included Inter-Agency Emergency Health Kits, Cholera Investigation and treatment kits, kits for the management of measles, non-communicable diseases, medical complications associated with severe acute malnutrition in children under five, and trauma management and emergency surgery kits. These kits are expected to serve approximately 830 000 people in the conflict-affected Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains areas for the next three months.
The shipment, worth USD 671 414, is the second that the WHO South Sudan has been able to deliver to Sudan since the outbreak of the conflict in April 2023. The dispatch of the supplies is part of WHO's continuous relief efforts in support of the Sudanese people in the current situation.
“As logistics plays a critical role in emergency response, we must have a strong logistical capacity to ensure swift delivery of supplies to the affected areas. This includes having robust transportation networks, stockpiles, and an efficient distribution system in place”, said Dr Humphrey Karamagi, WHO Representative for South Sudan. WHO has been working closely with the government to obtain the necessary clearances to ensure smooth delivery of the supplies.
Our commitment and willingness to work together with all relevant parties involved in the emergency response is a key factor in effectively addressing the challenges to ensuring the Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains areas with much-needed emergency medical supplies, said Dr Karamagi.
Following the outbreak of armed conflict in Sudan, tens of thousands of people fleeing fighting crossed into South Sudan. The WHO supported South Sudan’s Ministry of Health in scaling up its operational readiness and response by deploying multidisciplinary teams of emergency responders to states experiencing a high population influx to ensure the provision of much-needed healthcare services.

Title: Sudan’s war risks creating the world’s largest hunger crisis, warns WFP Chief
Content: 06 March 2024
JUBA – Sudan’s war has shattered millions of lives and created the world’s largest displacement crisis. Now this catastrophe also risks becoming the world’s largest hunger crisis, unless fighting stops, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director Cindy McCain warns today as she concludes a visit to South Sudan, where she met families fleeing violence and an escalating hunger emergency in Sudan.
“The war in Sudan risks triggering the world’s largest hunger crisis,” warned the Executive Director. “20 years ago, Darfur was the world’s largest hunger crisis and the world rallied to respond. But today, the people of Sudan have been forgotten. Millions of lives and the peace and stability of an entire region are at stake.”
Over 25 million people across Sudan, South Sudan, and Chad are trapped in a spiral of deteriorating food security. WFP is unable to get sufficient emergency food assistance to desperate communities in Sudan who are trapped by fighting because of the relentless violence and interference by the warring parties. Right now, 90 per cent of people facing emergency levels of hunger in Sudan are stuck in areas that are largely inaccessible to WFP.
Humanitarian assistance has been further disrupted after authorities revoked permissions for cross-border truck convoys, forcing WFP to halt its operations from Chad into Darfur. Over one million people in West and Central Darfur had received WFP assistance via this life-line route since August, and WFP was in the process of scaling up to support that number each month as hunger and malnutrition continue to skyrocket in Darfur.
Meanwhile, more and more people flee into South Sudan and Chad and the humanitarian response is at breaking point. Executive Director McCain travelled to Renk in eastern South Sudan where almost 600,000 people have crossed from Sudan in the last 10 months. The WFP chief visited the crowded transit camps where families arrive hungry and are met with more hunger.
Newly arrived displaced people in South Sudan make up 35 percent of those facing catastrophic levels of hunger – the highest possible level – despite accounting for less than 3 percent of the population. Additionally, one in five children at the transit centres at the main border crossing is malnourished. With current resources, WFP is struggling to keep pace with the significant level of need.
“I met mothers and children who have fled for their lives not once, but multiple times, and now hunger is closing in on them,” said the Executive Director. “The consequences of inaction go far beyond a mother unable to feed her child and will shape the region for years to come.  Today I am making an urgent plea for the fighting to stop, and that all humanitarian agencies must be allowed to do their life-saving work.”
WFP urgently needs unimpeded access in Sudan to address the escalating food insecurity, which will have significant long-term impacts on the region, along with an injection of funding to respond to the spread of the humanitarian crisis to neighbouring countries. Ultimately, a cessation of hostilities and lasting peace is the only way to reverse course and prevent catastrophe.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - on Sudan
Content: 29 February 2024
The United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) completes its withdrawal from Sudan on 29 February 2024.
The Secretary-General reiterates his deep appreciation to all international and national UNITAMS personnel for their dedication and service to the people of Sudan throughout the Mission’s mandate.
A small team will remain in Port Sudan to oversee the Mission's liquidation process, beginning on 1 March. The Secretary-General counts on the full cooperation of the Sudanese authorities to ensure this process is completed as smoothly and swiftly as possible.
The conflict that continues to rage in Sudan is further eroding the rule of law and protection of civilians, as well as jeopardizing the entire country and region. The Secretary-General calls on the conflict parties to lay down their weapons and commit to broad-based peace talks that lead to the resumption of a civilian-led democratic transition.
The United Nations is not leaving Sudan. It remains strongly committed to providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance and supporting the Sudanese people in their aspirations for a peaceful and secure future.
The Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, has commenced his work in support of mediation efforts, in coordination and close partnership with African and other international partners. These mediation efforts will complement the ongoing essential work of the United Nations Country Team on the ground, which includes providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance. Continued international support in that regard is of critical importance. The Secretary-General calls on the Sudanese authorities to continue their cooperation, including through facilitating the timely issuance of entry visas and the unhindered movement of United Nations personnel and partners in the country to deliver this much needed support.

Title: Horrific violations and abuses as fighting spreads - report
Content: 23 February 2024
GENEVA – The armed conflict in Sudan has resulted in thousands of civilians killed, millions displaced, property looted, and children conscripted, as fighting has spread to more regions of the country, says a wide-ranging report from the UN Human Rights Office.
The report details multiple indiscriminate attacks by both the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in densely populated areas, including sites sheltering internally displaced people - particularly in the capital Khartoum, as well as in Kordorfan and Darfur - during fighting between April and December 2023.
“For nearly a year now, accounts coming out of Sudan have been of death, suffering and despair, as the senseless conflict and human rights violations and abuses have persisted with no end in sight,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
“This report makes for yet more painful reading on the tragedy being needlessly inflicted on the Sudanese people since April 2023, but also underlines once more the dire need to end the fighting and to break the cycle of impunity that gave rise to this conflict in the first place. The guns must be silenced, and civilians must be protected. A credible re-start of inclusive talks to restore civilian-led government is desperately needed to open a path forward,” he said.
Just this week, credible video evidence reviewed by the UN Human Rights Office shows that several students travelling by road in North Kordofan State may have been beheaded by men in SAF uniform in El-Obeid City – the victims seen as being RSF supporters based on their perceived ethnicity. The video footage which was posted on social media on 15 February shows troops parading with decapitated heads in the street while chanting ethnic slurs.
The report is based on interviews with 303 victims and witnesses, including dozens conducted in Ethiopia and eastern Chad, as well as analysis of photographs, videos, and satellite imagery and other open source information. It shows that both parties to the conflict used explosive weapons with wide area effects, such as missiles fired from fighter jets, unmanned aerial vehicles, anti-aircraft weapons and artillery shells in densely populated areas.
In April, in two separate incidents in Khartoum, eight missiles fired by the SAF resulted in at least 45 civilian deaths. And in June, two artillery shells fired by the RSF hit Libya Souq, a market in Omdurman, killing at least 15 civilians. Later, on 28 September, RSF shells exploded in a bus station in Omdurman leaving at least 10 civilians dead.
In Darfur, thousands were killed in RSF attacks, some of which were ethnically motivated. The report finds that between May and November 2023, the RSF and its allied Arab militia carried out at least 10 attacks against civilians in El-Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, killing thousands of people, most of them from the African Masalit ethnic community. There were also killings by the RSF and its allies in the town of Morni and in Ardamata, where at least 87 bodies were buried in a mass grave.
By mid-December, more than 6.7 million people had been displaced by the conflict - both within Sudan and into neighbouring countries. This number has since increased to more than eight million.
The report reveals that by 15 December 2023, at least 118 people had been subjected to sexual violence, including rape, gang rape and attempted rape, among them 19 children. Many of the rapes, according to the report, were committed by RSF members, in homes and on the streets. One woman was held in a building and repeatedly gangraped over a period of 35 days. Only four victims of sexual violence were willing and able to report to the authorities, owing to stigma, distrust of the justice system, the collapse of the institutions of justice and fear of reprisals, says the report.
It cites the “People’s Authority to Support the Sudanese Armed Forces”, a pro-SAF entity, as stating that it had armed 255,000 young men in camps across Sudan. Children were also recruited by the RSF from Arab tribes in Darfur and Kordofan. African ethnic communities, including the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa also reportedly responded to recruitment campaigns by the SAF, the report finds.
“Some of these violations would amount to war crimes,” said Türk. “There must be prompt, thorough, effective, transparent, independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights and violations of international humanitarian law and those responsible must be brought to justice.”
The High Commissioner also called on both parties to the conflict to ensure rapid and unimpeded access to humanitarian aid in all areas under their respective control.

Title: WFP calls for urgent, safe access to feed millions in Sudan as fighting rages across the country
Content: 02 February 2024
PORT SUDAN – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) urgently calls on Sudan’s warring parties to provide immediate guarantees for the safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian food assistance to conflict-hit parts of Sudan, especially across conflict lines where hungry displaced civilians are trapped and cut-off from life-saving humanitarian assistance.
The situation in Sudan is dire. Despite WFP's efforts to provide food assistance to millions of people across the country since the war broke out, almost 18 million individuals across the country are currently facing acute hunger (IPC3+).
WFP has repeatedly warned of a looming hunger catastrophe in Sudan and people must be able to access aid immediately to prevent a crisis from becoming a catastrophe. Shockingly, the number of hungry has more than doubled from a year ago, and an estimated five million people are experiencing emergency levels of hunger (IPC phase 4) due to conflict in areas such as Khartoum, Darfur, and Kordofan.
WFP is the logistics backbone of the humanitarian response in Sudan and has ramped up lifesaving assistance in response to the deepening crisis, assisting over 6.5 million people since the war broke out. To reach families in Darfur, WFP established a cross-border route from Chad, through which over 1 million people have received food assistance. Other agencies have also used the route to deliver other much needed support.
However, WFP is currently only able to regularly deliver food assistance to 1 in 10 people facing emergency levels of hunger (IPC phase 4) in Sudan. These people are trapped in conflict hotspots, including Khartoum, Darfur, Kordofan, and now Gezira, and for assistance to reach them humanitarian convoys must be allowed to cross the frontlines. Yet it is becoming nearly impossible for aid agencies to cross due to security threats, enforced roadblocks, and demands for fees and taxation.
“The situation in Sudan today is nothing short of catastrophic. Millions of people are impacted by the conflict. WFP has food in Sudan, but lack of humanitarian access and other unnecessary hurdles are slowing operations and preventing us from getting vital aid to the people who most urgently need our support,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP Sudan Representative and Country Director in Sudan.
A vital humanitarian hub in Gezira state – which previously supported over 800,000 people a month - was engulfed by fighting in December and a key WFP warehouse looted. WFP is trying to obtain security guarantees to resume operations in the area to reach vulnerable families who are now trapped and in urgent need of food assistance.
Over half a million people fled Gezira in December. For many it was the second or third time they have been displaced in this conflict, which has sparked the world's largest displacement crisis. But just 40,000 of the newly displaced have so far received WFP assistance because 70 trucks - carrying enough food to feed half a million people for one month – were stuck in Port Sudan for over two weeks in January waiting for clearances, which were only secured last week. Now, distributions are ongoing in Kassala, Gedaref and Blue Nile states.
Another 31 WFP trucks, which should have been making regular aid deliveries to the Kordofans, Kosti and Wad Madani, have been parked empty and have been unable to leave El Obeid for over three months.
“Every single one our trucks need to be on the road each and every day delivering food to the Sudanese people, who are traumatised and overwhelmed after over nine months of horrifying conflict. Yet life-saving assistance is not reaching those who need it the most, and we are already receiving reports of people dying of starvation,” said Rowe.
“Both parties to this gruesome conflict must look beyond the battlefield and allow aid organisations operate. For that, we need the uninhibited freedom of movement, including across conflict lines, to help people who so desperately need it right now, regardless of where they are,” he warned.

Title: UN human rights expert on Sudan calls for urgent action on dismal human rights situation as conflict enters 10th month
Content: 17 January 2024
GENEVA – The UN expert on human rights in Sudan, Radhouane Nouicer, today deplored the grim human rights situation in the country as the brutal armed conflict enters its 10th month. He urged the leaders of the two parties to the conflict to immediately end the violence, ensure a transition to civilian rule and heed the calls of victims for peace and justice.
“Despite several regional and international mediation initiatives, there is still no peaceful resolution in sight and the people of Sudan continue to bear the brunt of this endless cycle of violence. Every day yields new accounts of human suffering, destruction and displacement,” said Nouicer.
“As fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces spreads across the country, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law are continuing unabated. It is crucial that the leaders of both sides show more political will to put an end to violence and silence the guns.”
Since the beginning of the conflict in April last year, thousands of civilians have been killed or injured. Both parties have shown complete disregard for international human rights law as well  as international humanitarian law, in particular the principles on the conduct of hostilities. More than 7.6 million people have been displaced from their homes, including over 1.5 million into neighbouring countries. At least 25 million people across Sudan are in need of assistance, among them 14 million children.
“In my regular meetings with Sudanese civil society representatives, I have heard horrific reports of human suffering, including hundreds of suspected cases of enforced disappearance and multiple cases of arbitrary detention by both parties to the conflict. I have also heard deeply disturbing accounts of sexual violence against women and girls, most of them allegedly perpetrated by members of the Rapid Support Forces and their allied militia,” said the expert.
Nouicer denounced the rise in ethnically motivated violence and hate speech, particularly in the Darfur region. In West Darfur, the Rapid Support Forces and allied Arab militias have repeatedly attacked members of the African Masalit community.
He also expressed alarm at reports of conscription of children and mobilization of civilians into “popular” resistance groups to fight alongside the Sudanese Armed Forces.
“Both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces have publicly made commitments to investigate gross violations and abuses committed during the conflict and break the cycle of impunity that is at the root of the ongoing tragedy, but so far, no actions have been taken to prosecute perpetrators, nor findings of investigations made public,” said Nouicer.
“I call on both parties to ensure all violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law are promptly and thoroughly investigated and those found responsible held to account.”
The expert also called on both sides to ensure safe, effective and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population.
“Sudan – a most fertile land – is running out of food, and 18 million people are facing acute hunger, but despite the enormous need, delivering aid remains extremely challenging due to ongoing hostilities, persistent insecurity, attacks on humanitarian workers and bureaucratic hurdles,” said Nouicer. “This must not continue. The Government of Sudan, which has the primary responsibility to protect civilians, must take concrete steps to ensure sufficient aid can reach all those in need and facilitate the access of humanitarian convoys to the populations affected by the conflict.”
Nouicer called on the international community to work together and produce a coherent, inclusive, unified and coordinated roadmap to help end the violence engulfing Sudan, and to support a Sudanese national dialogue involving political parties and civilian groups, including women and youth associations, leading to the transfer of power to a transitional civilian-led government.
The expert intends to visit Port Sudan in February ahead of the 55th Human Rights Council session scheduled for March 2024.

Title: WFP condemns theft of life-saving food from warehouse in Gezira State
Content: 28 December 2023
PORT SUDAN/NAIROBI – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) strongly condemns the looting of food supplies from its premises in Gezira State last weekend after elements of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke into the warehouse and office, following their takeover of Wad Medani.
The warehouse contained enough stocks to feed nearly 1.5 million severely food insecure people for one month in Gezira State, where a new offensive has forced more than 300,000 people to again run for their lives.
“Sudanese people who are already desperate and fleeing the fighting have now been robbed of the critical assistance they need. This is intolerable and must stop,” said Michael Dunford, WFP Regional Director for Eastern Africa.  “In areas under their control, the Rapid Support Forces must guarantee the protection of humanitarian assistance, staff and premises”.
The WFP warehouse contained more than 2,500 metric tons of life-saving food, including pulses, sorghum, vegetable oil and nutrition supplements. The specialized nutritious foods were intended to prevent and support malnutrition treatment for more than 20,000 children and pregnant and breastfeeding women through WFP-supported health centers.
WFP was forced to temporarily pause distributions in Gezira state last weekend. It is once again reconfiguring its humanitarian response and has started some distributions in states further to the East, where people fleeing Gezira are now seeking refuge.
WFP operations are a lifeline to nearly one million desperate people in Gezira state and the looting of premises undermines our operations at a time when nearly 18 million people are facing acute hunger.
WFP has supported more than 5.6 million people in seventeen of eighteen states across Sudan with food and nutrition assistance since the conflict erupted in mid-April 2023. The agency warned earlier this month of a looming hunger catastrophe if people are not able to receive aid.

Title: UNICEF: Hundreds of vulnerable children evacuated for second time as Sudan war continues to put millions of children at risk
Content: 27 December 2023
PORT SUDAN/NEW YORK – 253 babies and children have been safely evacuated from transit centres in Wad Madani, Sudan to a safer location in the country, after fighting in Al Jazirah state erupted this month. For many of the children, this is the second time they have been evacuated after they were evacuated from Mygoma orphanages in Khartoum earlier in the year following the outbreak of the war in April.
“The recent escalation of the conflict in Sudan, and the fact that these children needed to move from areas that were previously considered safer, is a cruel reminder of the continuing toll the war is taking on children,” said UNICEF’s Representative in Sudan, Mandeep O’Brien. “Thankfully, a coordinated effort has ensured these children are once again out of the line of fire. The safe passage was made possible by the cooperation and facilitation of both parties to the conflict and the support of key partners. However, as long as fighting continues, no child in Sudan will be truly safe.”
The children who were evacuated from Khartoum to Wad Madani in June continue to be under the care and protection of the Ministry of Social Development. The evacuation effort, led by the Ministry, and supported by UNICEF and partners, took place over 2 days.
UNICEF and partners continue to support the Ministry’s efforts to provide the children with medical care, food and nutrition, psychosocial stimulation, play and educational activities, and supporting carers for the children, and is working with the relevant authorities and partners to identify foster families for the children.
Across Sudan, over 14 million children are in urgent need of lifesaving humanitarian support, the highest number ever recorded in the country. The war in Sudan has resulted in the largest child displacement crisis in the World. Close to 3.5 million children have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the fighting. The impact of escalating violence - more than half of states in Sudan, 10 out of 18, are now experiencing active conflict - continues to threaten the lives and futures of families and children, leaving basic health and nutrition, education, water, sanitation and hygiene, and protection services cut off with frontline workers going without pay and many facilities closed, damaged, or destroyed.
UNICEF continues to call for an immediate ceasefire across Sudan, and reiterates its call for all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian and human rights law – including ensuring that children are protected – and that rapid, safe, unimpeded humanitarian access to children and families in affected areas is facilitated. Without such access, critical lifesaving humanitarian support will be out of reach for millions of vulnerable children.

Title: WHO: Thousands exposed to risk of cholera as violence escalates in Al Gezira State, Sudan
Content: 21 December 2023
Port Sudan – Access to health and other basic services has been disrupted since the escalation of violence spread to Al Gezira State on 15 December 2023. The situation in Wad Madani, the capital of the state, is particularly concerning. The few hospitals that are still operational are facing a critical shortage of staff and are overcrowded as most health workers have had to flee from the town.
For the past eight months, Al Gezira, the bread basket of Sudan, had been a safe haven for half a million people displaced mostly from Khartoum seeking safety from the conflict that started on 15 April 2023 in Khartoum and spread to the Darfur Kordofan states plunging the nation into a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
WHO has an operations hub and a warehouse in Wad Madani, which served Al Gezira, Khartoum and surrounding areas since the start of the conflict in April 2023. The hub’s operations have been suspended since 15 December and WHO staff are coordinating with partners for alternate mechanisms of continuing the health emergency response. The disruption of health services is putting the lives of patients at risk, including hundreds of cholera patients in cholera treatment centres, as the centres will soon run out of medical supplies.
Al Gezira State has reported over 1,800 cases of cholera and 26 deaths. Gains made in containing the cholera outbreak in the State could be lost due to interruption of disease control and surveillance coupled with large population movement, risking further cholera spread. The planned oral cholera vaccination campaign in Khartoum has currently had to be put on hold.
Due to the escalation of conflict in Al Gezira, at least 300,000 internally displaced persons have once again been displaced, most of them unsure where to find refuge next. They are once again without access to safe water, food, and healthcare at a time when outbreak-prone diseases are circulating. They also face other imminent threats to their health from injuries, trauma, and gender-based violence in the face of large-scale displacement. Sudan now has over 7 million displaced people, 5.5 million internally and 1.5 seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.
Several healthcare facilities in Wad Madani have been subject to attacks, and WHO is verifying reports of the killing of two health workers in Roufaa Hospital.
The deliberate targeting of healthcare, which includes patients, healthcare professionals, and facilities, is reprehensible and must immediately stop. Patients should not die in the very place they hoped to get protection for their life and well-being, and health workers should not die as they selflessly work to save lives.
The WHO is closely monitoring developments in Al Gezira state to initiate our emergency response plan. We are also monitoring the situation in Sennar, Gedaref, White Nile, and Blue Nile states as well as Darfur.
We call on our partners and the global community to stand with us with renewed resolve to restore health and hope for Sudan’s people. Above all, we call on parties to the conflict to put the people of Sudan first. Sudan needs peace.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on the launch of Sudan 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan
Content: 21 December 2023
In 2024, humanitarian organizations aim to provide humanitarian assistance and support to 14.7 million of the most vulnerable people at the cost of US$2.7 billion. This plan, a collective effort of all humanitarian actors and stakeholders in the country, will address the specific needs of women, children, the disabled, and other vulnerable groups.
Port Sudan - The humanitarian community in Sudan launches today the 2024 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan (HNRP) to address the most urgent and critical needs of 14.7 million people in Sudan that have been displaced and affected by the conflict that erupted in April 2023. This includes people newly displaced, some of whom were already living in protracted displacement, refugees that found shelter and assistance in Sudan, and host communities that have generously taken in millions of displaced people from conflict-affected areas.
Heavy fighting that started in Khartoum on 15 April 2023 quickly spread to the larger Darfur and Kordofan regions and has had an impact on every state in the country. The conflict has displaced millions of people and it is now the largest displacement and protection crisis in the world.
“More than eight months since the start of the conflict, the humanitarian needs keep growing and almost 25 million people across Sudan will require humanitarian assistance in 2024. At the same time, the severity levels and scope of the needs are increasing,” the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Ms. Clementine Nkweta-Salami said.
The fighting has also caused extensive damage to critical infrastructure and an estimated 70 per cent of health facilities in states affected by conflict are not working.
Devastating conflict, coupled with the continued economic decline, has driven about 17.7 million people across Sudan into high levels of acute food insecurity. About 3 million children are displaced making Sudan the country with the highest number of displaced children globally. In addition, 19 million are not in school.
Meanwhile, lack of access due to insecurity and bureaucratic impediments are hindering humanitarian organizations from reaching those in need. Attention, or lack of it is another daunting challenge. The world is dealing with a multitude of crises, many of which receive much more attention than the crisis in Sudan, but it is not because of the scale. In that regard, the Sudan crisis has few equals.
In 2024, humanitarian organizations aim to provide humanitarian assistance and support to 14.7 million of the most vulnerable people at the cost of US$2.7 billion. This plan, a collective effort of all humanitarian actors and stakeholders in the country, will address the specific needs of women, children, the disabled, and other vulnerable groups.
The 2024 HRP will, as in previous years, prioritize multi-cluster, life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable. “The UN and partners agencies appreciate the generous support from donors and urge them to continue supporting humanitarian action in Sudan, it is needed now more than ever,” Nkweta-Salami said.

Title: UNICEF: Almost 3 million children in Sudan’s Al Jazirah state at risk as violence escalates
Content: 21 December 2023
NEW YORK/AMMAN/PORT SUDAN, 21 December 2023 – The escalation in fighting in Sudan’s Al Jazirah state has reportedly forced at least 150,000 children from their homes in less than a week, UNICEF warned today. The eruption of fighting in Al Jazirah means that more than half of states in Sudan – 10 out of 18 – are experiencing active conflict.
An estimated 5.9 million people live in Al Jazirah State, with approximately half of the population being children.
Since the escalation of the conflict in Sudan on April 15, nearly 500,000 people fled violence elsewhere in the country to Al Jazirah State, with almost 90,000 of those seeking refuge in the state capital Wad Madani.
“Tens of thousands of vulnerable children in Al Jazirah state have been forced to flee their homes in search of safety as fighting erupts into areas that were previously considered relatively safe,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “This new wave of violence could leave children and families trapped between fighting lines or caught in the crossfire, with fatal consequences. With reports of renewed fighting elsewhere in the country, millions of children in Sudan are once again at grave risk.”
The city of Wad Madani serves as the primary hub for many essential, lifesaving services in Al Jazirah state, including the only kidney dialysis centre in the state. The city currently hosts hundreds of vulnerable children evacuated from other parts of the country, and has served as a hub for humanitarian operations since fighting broke out in April. Attacks on or disruption of these services would immediately endanger the lives of thousands of people, including children.
The escalation in fighting has led to a suspension of all humanitarian field missions within and from Al Jazirah State as of 15 December, further impacting children and families.
"Our colleagues in Sudan have heard bone-chilling stories of the harrowing journeys women and children were forced to make just to reach the safety of Madani city," said Russell. “Now, even that fragile sense of security is shattered as those same children have once again been forced from their homes. No child should have to experience the horrors of war. Children, and the civilian infrastructure they rely on, must be protected.”
Even prior to the latest escalation in Madani, more than 3 million children had been forced to flee widespread violence in search of safety, food and water, shelter and protection, opportunities for learning and health care—most remaining within Sudan—while hundreds of thousands are sheltering in sprawling makeshift camps in neighbouring countries. This makes Sudan the largest child displacement crisis in the world.
Over the last nine months, UNICEF and partners have worked to provide life-saving assistance to over 6 million children inside Sudan and in neighbouring countries, including water, health, nutrition, safe spaces and learning. Yet while the scale of humanitarian needs continues to dwarf available resources and funding, further support, along with safe and unhindered humanitarian access to deliver life-saving supplies, is critical. UNICEF’s humanitarian appeal for Sudan for this year remains only 27 per cent funded. UNICEF requires $840 million in 2024 to sustain and scale lifesaving and resilience services for close to 8 million of the most vulnerable children in Sudan.
UNICEF continues to call for an immediate ceasefire across Sudan, and reiterates its call for all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian and human rights law –  including ensuring that children are protected – and that rapid, safe, unimpeded humanitarian access to children and families in affected areas is facilitated. Without such access, critical lifesaving humanitarian support will be out of reach for millions of vulnerable children.

Title: WFP warns of major setback to aid efforts as fighting spreads in Sudan
Content: 20 December 2023
PORT SUDAN – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has been forced to temporarily suspend food assistance in some parts of Gezira State, as fighting spreads south and east of Sudan’s capital Khartoum. This is a major setback to humanitarian efforts in the country’s breadbasket, where WFP had been regularly providing aid to over 800,000 people, including many who escaped the fighting in Khartoum.
“We already lost our homes in Khartoum and watched as our lives were destroyed before our eyes. Now we are forced to flee yet again, leaving behind what little we had left. Hundreds of thousands are fleeing on foot, with nowhere to go. We are so worried about those who already lived through the horrors in Khartoum, and now find themselves trapped in Wad Madani with no way out,” said Karim Abdelmoneim, WFP’s Emergency Coordinator for Gezira State.
“A place of refuge has now become a battleground in a war that has already taken a horrific toll on civilians. This has forced WFP to put on hold food deliveries in some locations in Gezira State at a time when people need our help the most,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP Representative and Country Director in Sudan.
Around 300,000 people have fled Gezira State in a matter of days, since clashes erupted on Friday. Ongoing fighting makes it extremely challenging for humanitarian agencies to safely deliver assistance, especially with more and more people on the move, fleeing for their lives.
“We are committed to supporting the people of Sudan in their hour of greatest need, but the safety of our staff and partners must be guaranteed. Our teams are working around the clock to provide food aid in locations where it is still possible and resume planned assistance in other areas when it is safe to do so," Rowe said.
“The safety of humanitarian staff, supplies and premises is paramount and must be ensured no matter the circumstances. We urge all parties to adhere to their obligations under International Humanitarian Law for the sake of innocent civilians who so desperately need support,” Rowe added.
If the conflict spills over into Sudan’s grain-producing region, it would have dramatic consequences on agricultural production and food availability in the coming months – at a time when hunger is already at record levels according to recent IPC food security assessments. The agency’s plans to boost wheat production in Gezira, with support from the African Development Bank, could also be in jeopardy.
Nearly 18 million people in Sudan are acutely food insecure during the ongoing harvest season, a time when food is typically more available. Yet initial assessments show that crop yields have taken a hit due to the conflict, as rising prices of fertilizers, seeds and fuel hinder farming during the planting season.
“Sudan’s breadbasket must remain for what it was intended – farming, not fighting. Otherwise, we may see an even more catastrophic hunger crisis as the lean season gets underway in May 2024,” Rowe warned.
Background/Note to the Editor
Half of all wheat produced in Sudan comes from Gezira, where an average of 350,000 mt of wheat is harvested annually – enough to fed around six million people. The state is also home to the one million-hectare Gezira Agricultural Scheme, one of the largest gravity-fed irrigation schemes in the world, and a source of income and livelihood for millions locally. The state’s high agricultural capacity and key location along critical supply routes that lead to Sudan’s capital Khartoum, make it vital to Sudan’s food system.

Title: WFP warns that hunger catastrophe looms in conflict-hit Sudan without urgent food assistance
Content: 13 December 2023
PORT SUDAN – Parts of war-ravaged Sudan are at a high risk of slipping into catastrophic hunger conditions by next year’s lean season if the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is unable to expand access and regularly deliver food assistance to people trapped in conflict hotspots such as Khartoum, the Darfurs, and the Kordofans, warns the UN food agency today.
Sudan – once described as East Africa’s future breadbasket – is facing a deepening hunger crisis as the conflict raging across the country approaches its eighth month. A new food security analysis for Sudan shows the highest levels of hunger ever recorded during the harvest season (October through February), typically a period where more food is available. If there is no significant increase in food assistance by the time the lean season arrives next May, conflict hotspots could see the emergence of catastrophic hunger, also known as Phase 5 on the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).
“We urgently call on all parties to the conflict for a humanitarian pause and unfettered access to avert a hunger catastrophe in the upcoming lean season. Lives depend on it, yet there are far too many people trapped in areas with active fighting who we can only reach sporadically, if at all,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP Country Director and Representative in Sudan.
Nearly 18 million people across Sudan are facing acute hunger (IPC3+) – more than double the number at the same time a year ago. This figure is also higher than the initial projection of 15 million made in the previous assessment in August, demonstrating just how rapidly the food security situation is worsening.
Currently, close to 5 million people are in emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC4) with over three-quarters of these people cornered in areas where humanitarian access has been intermittent and, in some areas, impossible due to ongoing fighting.
Since the start of the conflict, WFP has provided life-saving assistance to over five million people, preventing an even worse deterioration of food security, especially in eastern and northern Sudan. Despite this, regular and safe humanitarian access to civilians in areas worst hit by violence has been inadequate. WFP has taken advantage of momentary lulls in fighting to reach families in greater Khartoum with food assistance but has only managed to reach the capital once in the last three months. Overall, of the people that WFP has identified as most urgently in need of food assistance in the Khartoum metropolitan area, only one in five has  received food aid since the conflict started.
Regular convoys of food assistance have travelled from Chad to West and Central Darfur since August, providing half a million people with food assistance. Yet, people in other parts of the Darfur region have not received any assistance since June despite WFP’s repeated attempts to obtain safe access.
“The speed at which hunger has risen over the past year is alarming. More and more people are struggling to eat a basic meal a day, and   unless things change there is a very real risk they won’t even be able to do that,” concluded Rowe.
The key drivers of the plunge into hunger include intensified conflict and growing intercommunal violence, macroeconomic crisis, soaring prices of food, fuel and essential goods, and below average agricultural production.
Note to the Editors:
“Catastrophe” and “Famine” are both classifications of IPC/CH Phase 5, indicating dire food security situations. However, there are notable differences between the two: IPC/CH Phase 5 “Catastrophe” denotes an extreme food crisis and is classified at household level rather than in a geographical area. Households can be classified as being in “Catastrophe” even when a full famine declaration for a specific geographic area was not reached. IPC/CH Phase 5 “Famine” represents the most extreme form of acute food insecurity and can only be made via an IPC classification at a specific geographic level.

Title: Escalating conflict and persistent economic decline deepen food security crisis
Content: 12 December 2023
Urgent and collective action is needed
Cairo/Khartoum – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) sounds the alarm about the escalating food security crisis in the Sudan, urging immediate and collective action to avert an impending humanitarian catastrophe.
According to the newly released Integrated Food Security Phase (IPC) projections, 17.7 million people across the Sudan, which accounts for 37 percent of the analysed population, are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in IPC Phase 3 or above (Crisis or worse) between October 2023 and February 2024. The most acutely food insecure populations are located in states affected by high levels of organized violence, including Greater Darfur, Greater Kordofan and Khartoum – especially in the tri-city area of Khartoum, Bahri and Omdurman.
The ongoing conflict and the escalating violence are deepening the humanitarian crisis and worsening the food security of people in several urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Further compounding this is the low agricultural production, high food prices, climate shocks and displacement according to FAO’s recently released Rapid assessment on the summer season agriculture performance.
Widespread violence has resulted in the displacement of 6.3 million people, including around 5.1 million who have been internally displaced and 1.2 million who sought refuge in neighbouring countries. The majority of internally displaced people come from eight states, with Khartoum state representing the largest share at 67 percent. The displaced population is scattered across all 18 states of the Sudan and extends beyond the country's borders, particularly to Chad, South Sudan, and Egypt.
The conflict has also inflicted serious harm and destruction on critical infrastructure, including healthcare facilities, schools, roads, power and water sources as well as telecommunications assets. Widespread looting of markets, banks, industries, and public buildings has led to an increased shortage of essential services, food and non-food items across the country, further worsening the fragile food insecurity and malnutrition situation.
Between July and September 2023, ahead of the critical planting season, FAO reached over 1 million farming households– or 5 million people – to support local food production and sustain rural livelihoods. However, instability and access challenges continue to threaten food security.
"In the face of alarming food security challenges, FAO stands unwavering in its commitment to support Sudanese rural communities. The urgency is clear, and our dedication is resolute, but the road ahead demands more funding to sustain our vital support," said Hongjie Yang, FAO Representative in the Sudan.
FAO urgently needs $75.4 million, which represents almost 80 percent of the funding required under the revised Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan from May to December 2023. These funds are crucial to address escalating needs, enhance local food production, and improve its accessibility across the country.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on the attack on an ICRC convoy
Content: 11 December 2023
I am horrified by this reckless attack on an ICRC convoy, which tragically claimed the lives of two people and injured seven more, including three from ICRC.
(Nairobi) The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami has expressed deep alarm and shock at the news of an attack on an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) convoy in Khartoum on 10 December.

“I am horrified by this reckless attack on an ICRC convoy, which tragically claimed the lives of two people and injured seven more, including three from ICRC. The convoy was clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem - a universal symbol for neutrality and protection. My thoughts are with the families and colleagues affected” the Humanitarian Coordinator said.

The humanitarian convoy, including three ICRC vehicles and three buses, was due to evacuate over a hundred vulnerable civilians from Khartoum to Wad Madani when it came under attack upon entering the evacuation area.

“I have consistently urged the Sudanese Armed Forces, the Rapid Support Forces, and all parties to Sudan’s conflict to respect the principles of international humanitarian law and ensure the safety of civilians and medical personnel, to immediately halt attacks on civilian infrastructure and medical facilities and to allow unrestricted humanitarian access to provide critical aid and medical assistance to affected populations. Civilians, humanitarian aid workers and medical personnel are #NotATarget,” she emphasized. “It is incumbent upon the parties engaged in conflict to ensure the safe evacuation of civilians from areas of active combat. This entails an obligation to provide and facilitate unimpeded passage for those seeking to leave conflict zones” she added.

Since fighting broke out on April 15 over 12,000 people have been killed, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). Of those, at least 20 aid workers have been killed and 36 injured. Since 15 April, the World Health Organization has verified 60 attacks on the health care system resulting in 34 deaths and 38  injuries.

The Humanitarian Coordinator concluded: “The conflict in Sudan continues to inflict harm on civilians. The situation is catastrophic. The suffering of the Sudanese needs to come to an end once and for all. I call on the parties, yet again, to pursue the path of peace for the sake of the future of the country”.

Title: Statement of the Sudanese Women
Content: 17 November 2023
Open Session of the African Union Peace and Security Council: Women Peace and Security

Your Excellency Ambassador Abdi Mohamoud Eyde
Your Excellency Ambassador Bankole Adeoye
Your Excellency Madam Bineta Diop
Distinguished Members of the Peace and Security Council, members of the diplomatic corps, representatives from the UN agencies, and regional economic communities
Good morning.
We express our appreciation for the opportunity to speak before the Peace and Security Council of the African Union as we mark 23rd anniversary of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325. We are here today, representing 80 diverse groups, coalitions, and networks of Sudanese women peace builders. Our message today is formulated from the collective voices of over 400 Sudanese women from 14 out of the 18 states of Sudan who were consulted in July and August 2023 with the support of the UN Women.
Today, we remember the significant contributions of Sudanese women, especially younger women, in the Revolution of December 2018.  They advocated for freedom, peace, and justice. The revolution demonstrated their resilience   knowledge, skills, and the to push for equal participation and representation in all decision-making structures, including political and peace processes. The revolution gave us hope that gender justice and equality was possible in Sudan.
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Sadly, the current war erupted which has not only diminish our hope but has caused   untold human suffering and financial crises. Over 9 million people have been displaced, 69% of the internally displaced persons are women. 90% of refugees crossing the border to Chad and other countries are women and girls. Over 24 million people require humanitarian assistance, with 4 million women and girls are at risk of gender-based violence, mainly in conflict hotspots like Khartoum, Darfur, and Kordofan.
In the midst of the fragile security situation, Sudanese women endure significant hardship as they strive to secure food, medicine, water, shelter, and essential needs while men often avoid venturing outside due to fear of being murdered, detained, tortured, or kidnapped.
The war has profoundly affected the livelihoods of Sudanese women throughout the country. Vulnerable and marginalized women face additional economic burdens due to displacement, especially those residing in IDP camps and shelters such as schools and hostels. These shelters are not safe for women, as several cases of gender-based violence have been documented. In addition to the dire humanitarian situation, there is limited and in some cases lack of access to basic services    especially sexual and reproductive health related services. Even the women living in communities less impacted by the conflict struggle to survive due to the burden of care for displaced relatives.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Today, Sudanese women’s bodies are used as weapons of war, where they are systematically raped by armed forces. Women from certain ethnic groups were targeted with different forms of sexual violence including rape, such as what is currently happening in Elginena, the capital of West Darfur state.
In these challenging times, we, Sudanese women remain extraordinarily resilient. We have created an inclusive platform comprised of women from different regions, age groups, and ethnic backgrounds. Our common message is immediate end of war. Sudanese women continue to demand an immediate cessation of hostilities, seek humanitarian aid, ensure the provision of social services, and safeguard women from all forms of violence, especially Conflict-Related Sexual Violence. However, women-led organizations and women human rights defenders are facing challenges and limitations including targeted harassment, arrest, and obstruction of organizations' activities.
Sudanese women actively participate in providing humanitarian assistance through "Emergency Rooms," monitoring human rights abuses as part of the "Emergency Lawyers" Group, and volunteering in Community Based Organizations who remain the first responders. We recognize and appreciate the recent emerging national civilian initiatives to end the war, establish a civil government, and return to a democratic transition. These initiatives provide opportunities for women to engage and advocate for women’s representation and inclusion. We also recognize the international efforts to mediate between the warring parties, but these efforts are lacking meaningful women’s voices. We strongly confirm that sustainable peace for Sudan can only be achieved through equal and meaningful participation of women in the ongoing peace process.
Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen,
We are grateful for the support of the African Union, IGAD and UN Women that has enabled the establishment of the Sudanese Women’s Platform that has mobilized women to advocate for peace and ensure women’s inclusion in all peace processes.
We call on the members of the Peace and Security Council to amplify these efforts in line with peace-related regional and international instruments including the UNSCR 1325, UNSCR 2250, the African Charter on Human and People’s Right, the African Road Map on Silencing the Gun, and the Maputo protocol to:

Title: FAO reaches one million farming households since the outbreak of conflict
Content: 15 November 2023

Rome - Following the outbreak of conflict in Sudan in April 2023, plunging nearly half the population into a humanitarian crisis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) distributed nearly 10 000 tonnes of seeds to 1 million farming households – or 5 million people – in time for the critical planting season from June to September 2023. This was made possible thanks to the generous support of its resource partners and in collaboration with dedicated local implementing partners.
According to a new FAO response overview released today, this critical seeds support has enabled farmers to produce enough food to meet the cereal needs of between 13 and 19 million people.
It also shares that, according to a forthcoming summer season assessment, the total planted area of all crops is estimated to be 15 percent lower than the annual average during the summer season. In addition to the conflict, farmers reported a swell of challenges, such as high agricultural input prices (seeds, tools) and a critical lack of inputs, finance and extension services.
“FAO’s support to the Sudanese rural communities was immense but the needs are still growing. Agricultural support must continue, and funding is critically needed to match resources to needs,” said Hongjie Yang, FAO Representative in Sudan. “This is an urgent reminder to continue taking action now and show the people of Sudan they have not been and will not be forgotten.”
Support must be urgently scaled up
FAO’s response came as a result of a grave rise in food security needs, where more than 20 million people were assessed to face crisis levels of acute food insecurity. Complicating this picture is an expected rise in animal disease outbreaks due to the lack of veterinary services and vaccines. This could lead to significant livestock losses, and potentially ripple into a decline in meat and milk consumption, driving up malnutrition rates among children.
Acting in advance to prevent this, FAO is providing vital livestock support packages with animal health support including vaccination and treatment for 1.3 million vulnerable households. Agropastoral and pastoral households will also receive milking goats crucial for children under 5 as well as concentrate animal feed and mineral licks to keep their livestock healthy. Moreover, to counteract estimated production losses and a further deterioration of food security and livelihoods, FAO is expected to reach 0.7 million households with a variety of vegetable seeds for the winter season.
As a result, through these interventions, FAO plans to support a total of 2 million agropastoral and pastoral households between November and December 2023.
However, to expand its support, FAO urgently needs $75.4 million corresponding to almost 80 percent of funding required under the revised Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan from May to December 2023. The funds are needed to respond to ever-growing needs and boost food production and its availability throughout the country to ensure people can restore and maintain their livelihoods.

Title: UNOPS and the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation sign €4.2 million to Promote Quality Health Care Service Provision in Sudan
Content: 07 November 2023

The government of Italy and UNOPS today signed a € 4.2 million project to support the people of Sudan in achieving sustainable development goals 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. The project is aimed at improving health conditions in Sudan, Kassala State.
The situation in Sudan has significantly worsened with the war which began on 15 April 2023, the social infrastructures have been damaged due to conflict and looting. The conflict has brought about immense misery on a scale never witnessed before. Hospital rooms are full of injured children, and human dignity has been completely disregarded. With deficient healthcare systems, overstretched and often unprepared health workers, there is indeed limited capacity to effectively manage and provide the required healthcare services for the population.
Over 2.8 million individuals will benefit from the project's intervention, which will greatly improve access to high-quality healthcare and address the health issues the country is currently facing. Cross-cutting issues like equity and gender will be at the center of the project.
The Italian Ambassador to Sudan, H.E. Michele Tommasi, stated that Italy is one of the leading donors in terms of financial assistance provided to support Sudan in various sectors. These sectors include health, social inclusion, disability, gender equality, economic progress, agriculture, and preservation of cultural and archaeological heritage. Among the most important initiatives, Italy is funding the creation of the Kassala Health Citadel, a large health district that will have 120 beds, a fully-equipped Diagnostic Centre, a Blood Bank, a pediatric hospital, a maternity hospital with operating rooms, and intensive care units, a new operating block, as well as laboratories for controlling and responding to recurrent epidemic crises that affect the area. This partnership between the AICS Khartoum Office and UNOPS represents a successful example of best practice, commitment, and deep collaboration, capable of achieving significant and concrete results for the benefit of the Sudanese people”.
Mr. Michele Morana, the Director of AICS Khartoum, stated that AICS has been unwavering in its efforts to support Sudan. We have intensified our support and localized it in the Eastern States of the Country, where the Italian Cooperation has a long-lasting presence and strong relationships with the Sudanese authorities, based on mutual trust and collaboration. The joint intervention with UNOPS has been focused on the Kassala Health Citadel, which is a part of the Italian Cooperation's strategy to support and strengthen the Sudanese Health System. The Kassala Health Citadel is a unique health district in the Sudanese panorama that offers tertiary-level hospital services, serving not only the Kassala population but the population of neighbouring States.
Ms. Worknesh Mekonnen, Multi-Country Office (Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Djibouti) Director and Representative to the AU on her part said “The Italian government has a deep commitment to the people of East Africa. This is the fourth project we are signing with the Government of Italy in 2023, and I would like to express my gratitude to the Italian government for their unwavering support of the initiative aimed at enhancing the quality of life for those we assist.”
Sudan is facing multiple overlapping humanitarian crises, putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of millions of people and driving continued high and urgent needs for humanitarian support. The ongoing conflict, violence, and climatic shocks continue to exacerbate the humanitarian needs and have greatly slowed down the gains toward SDGs in the country.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on Statement of Commitments adopted in Jeddah
Content: 07 November 2023
The promises made by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – to protect civilians and provide unimpeded humanitarian access – are promises that must be kept.
(Port Sudan) The Statement of Commitments adopted in Jeddah today by the parties to the conflict in Sudan marks a moment of truth for the country. The promises made by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – to protect civilians and provide unimpeded humanitarian access – are promises that must be kept.

I thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United States, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development – representing IGAD and the African Union – for their role in facilitating these critical negotiations.

In particular, I welcome the agreement to establish a Humanitarian Forum for Sudan led by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs representing the humanitarian community and with the participation of the parties to the conflict. The forum will further facilitate the implementation of the commitments made in Jeddah.

It comes -and not a moment too soon. After almost seven months of war, half of Sudan’s population – nearly 25 million people – need humanitarian assistance. Displacement, disease and sexual violence are rampant.

The tangible commitments agreed by the SAF and RSF today must now be followed by immediate and tangible actions. It is critical that the obstacles – bureaucratic and otherwise – that keep us from delivering life-saving relief at speed and at scale are cleared away once and for all.

We must have reliable guarantees from all parties to ensure that relief items, humanitarian workers and assets can move safely across conflict lines. We simply cannot reach Khartoum, Darfur, the Kordofans and other war-torn areas of the country without these assurances.

The parties to the conflict have a shared obligation to honour the commitments made in Jeddah. For the sake of the millions of civilians in Sudan who want no part of this war and in the spirit of today’s agreement, they must work toward a permanent cessation of hostilities. The people of Sudan deserve nothing less.

Title: Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Liz Throssell

Sudan
Geneva
We are deeply alarmed by reports that women and girls are being abducted and held in inhuman, degrading slave-like conditions in areas controlled by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Darfur, where they are allegedly forcibly married and held for ransom. Credible information from survivors, witnesses and other sources suggests more than 20 women and girls have been taken, but the number could be higher.
Some sources have reported seeing women and girls in chains on pick-up trucks and in cars.
Initial allegations arose early in the conflict in the Khartoum area, which has remained largely under the control of the Rapid Support Forces. One of the reports indicated that women and girls had been abducted and detained at a location in the city’s Al-Riyadh district, from as early as 24 April. Since then, we have continued to receive reports of abductions, with an increasing number of cases being reported in the Darfur region, particularly North, Central and South Darfur, and in the Kordofan region.
These shocking reports come amid a persistent climb in cases of sexual violence in the country since fighting broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces six months ago.
According to our documentation, at least 105 people have been subjected to sexual violence since the hostilities began on 15 April 2023.
As of 2 November, our Joint Human Rights Office in Sudan had received credible reports of more than 50 incidents of sexual violence linked to the hostilities, impacting at least 105 victims - 86 women, one man and 18 children. Twenty-three of the incidents involved rape, 26 were of gang rape and three were of attempted rape.
At least 70 percent of the confirmed incidents of sexual violence recorded - 37 incidents in total – are attributed to men in RSF uniforms, eight to armed men affiliated with the RSF, two to men in unidentified uniform, and one to the Sudan Armed Forces. The remaining cases involved as yet unidentified men.
We restate High Commissioner Volker Türk’s calls on senior officials of both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces – as well as armed groups affiliated with them - to unequivocally condemn these vile acts and issue – urgently – clear instructions to their subordinates demanding zero tolerance of sexual violence. They must also ensure the abducted women and girls are promptly released, and provided with the necessary support, including medical and psychosocial care, and that all alleged cases are fully and promptly investigated, with those found responsible held accountable and brought to justice.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on indiscriminate attacks on civilian facilities and infrastructure
Content: 25 October 2023
I am deeply concerned that facilities that are necessary for the functioning of basic services including water, sanitation, and health care, are under attack in Sudan
Port Sudan – The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami has expressed deep concern over continued reports of attacks against civilian infrastructure as brutal fighting continues across Sudan.
 
“I am deeply concerned that facilities that are necessary for the functioning of basic services including water, sanitation, and health care, are under attack in Sudan,” the Humanitarian Coordinator said.
 
In October alone there have been several incidents. On 9 October, shells struck Al Nao hospital, one of the last functioning hospitals in Omdurman, killing two people and injuring five others at a time when medical personnel were attending to patients. Four other shells exploded near the hospital, killing two more people.
 
This is only the latest such attack. Since 15 April, the World Health Organization has verified 58 attacks on the health care system resulting in 31 deaths and 38 injuries – an average of ten attacks per month. More than 70 per cent of health facilities in conflict-affected states are non-functional, severely limiting access to health care for millions of innocent civilians.
 
On 21 October, the Al Manara water treatment plan in Omdurman was fired on leading to the temporary stoppage of the water supply. This kind of disruption is extremely worrying given the ongoing cholera outbreak in Khartoum State and other parts of the country. Furthermore, a damaged water plant not only disrupts the supply for days but could also result in a prolonged crisis that affects agriculture, industry, and daily life.
 
“Over the past six months, I have repeatedly called on the Sudanese Armed Forces, the Rapid Support Forces, and all parties to Sudan’s conflict to protect civilian infrastructure. International Humanitarian Law is clear in this regard. All parties to armed conflict must take constant care to spare civilian objects, including humanitarian personnel and assets, and essential infrastructure. These attacks must stop,” she emphasized.
 
The Humanitarian Coordinator added: “The conflict has caused untold suffering in Sudan at a scale never seen before. Human dignity has gone out the window, and little is sacred anymore, not even hospital wards full of sick and wounded children. I implore the parties, yet again: end this terrible agony by silencing the guns”.

Title: Government of the Sudan and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations call for water action on World Food Day
Content: 16 October 2023
"With the double threat of conflict and climate shocks, it is our duty to ensure we use water wisely, distribute it equally, and preserve aquatic food systems.”
Khartoum – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) joins the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests in celebrating World Food Day 2023 to highlight the significant role of water as the essence of life on earth, the increasing pressure put on water resources and the collective action to be taken to preserve and manage water.
Each year the world celebrates World Food Day to commemorate the founding of FAO in 1945. The collective action across 150 countries worldwide, in up to 50 languages, is what makes World Food Day one of the most celebrated days of the UN calendar. Hundreds of events and outreach activities bring together governments, businesses, civil society organizations, media, as well as the public and youth. They promote worldwide awareness on hunger and promote action for the future of food, people and the planet.
This year, World Food Day is observed globally, and in the Sudan, under the theme "Water is life, water is food. Leave no one behind". The day highlights the massive impact of conflict and climate shocks, including erratic rainfall and rising temperature, on access to food and water as well as food production and availability.
“With the double threat of conflict and climate shocks, it is our duty to ensure we use water wisely, distribute it equally, and preserve aquatic food systems,” said Hongjie Yang, FAO Representative in the Sudan. “When we do this, we ensure no one is left behind.”
The World Food Day also emphasizes that collective action is needed to address global water challenges. As farmers, governments, humanitarians, private sector, civil society and individuals – in the face of this conflict and growing humanitarian needs – we need to work together to address people’s acute lack of access to food and water.

Title: Sudan is reeling after six months of war
Content: 15 October 2023
Statement by Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator
Half a year of war has plunged Sudan into one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history.
With up to 9,000 people reportedly killed, more than 5.6 million driven from their homes and 25 million people in need of aid, the impact of this conflict on Sudan and the region cannot be overstated.
For six months, civilians– particularly in Khartoum, Darfur and Kordofan – have known no respite from bloodshed and terror. Horrific reports of rape and sexual violence continue to emerge, and clashes are increasingly taking place along ethnic lines, particularly in Darfur.
Aid workers continue to be stymied in reaching people in need, hampered by insecurity and red tape. At least 45 aid workers have been killed or detained since 15 April – almost all of them are national staff.
Even in areas we can access, humanitarians are hamstrung by underfunding: Just 33 per cent of the $2.6 billion required to help those in need in Sudan this year has been received.
Cholera is already stalking the country, with more than 1,000 suspected cases in Gedaref, Khartoum, and Kordofan states.
Basic services are crumbling. More than 70 per cent of health care facilities in conflict areas are out of service. The fighting is keeping 19 million children out of school, significantly setting back their education and the country’s future.
The result? Communities torn apart. Vulnerable people with no access to life-saving aid. Mounting humanitarian needs in the neighbouring countries where millions have fled.
This cannot go on.
It is time for parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law. It is time for them to honor the commitments they made in Jeddah to protect civilians and allow humanitarian aid. It is time for them to recommit to dialogue at the highest levels to end this conflict, once and for all.
It is also time for donors to step up their support.
The international community cannot desert the people of Sudan.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami
Content: 05 October 2023
Killing of displaced civilians is unacceptable
(Port Sudan): I am outraged by reports that six displaced people were killed and about 2,300 left homeless after their shelters were burnt during clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces near Hasahisa camp, Central Darfur, on 26 September.
 
Further reports indicate that pumps supplying water to the camp were damaged, cutting the supply to displaced people. The fighters reportedly occupied a school near the camp from where they shelled their opponents, putting displaced people at risk of being caught in the crossfire.
According to community leaders, the camp hosts about 50,000 people who have resided there since 2005.
 
Since April, about 5.5 million people have fled their homes due to the conflict in search of safety and refuge; 4.3 million have been displaced within Sudan and 1.2 million to neighbouring countries. This high number of displaced people in a short time has made Sudan one of the world’s fastest-growing displacement crises.
 
Many of those displaced are in dire need of life-saving assistance and protection. Community leaders in Hasahisa camp report an urgent need for shelter, food, protection, and health assistance. Like in many areas of Sudan, the violence limits humanitarian access and deters efforts to deliver assistance.
 
The suffering in Sudan has gone on for too long. Attacks on civilians and camps for displaced people are unacceptable. I urge all parties to the conflict to abide by their obligations to safeguard civilians and civilian infrastructure and to respect international humanitarian and human rights laws.

Title: Statement to the Press on Sudan
Content: 05 October 2023
Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Ms.Clementine Nkweta-Salami
Geneva 
 
Good morning,
 
The past six months have caused untold suffering in Sudan.
 
Some 5.4 million people have fled their homes and are today displaced within Sudan or in neighbouring countries.
 
That is an average of more than 30,000 a day, many fleeing with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Sudan has become the world’s fastest-growing displacement crisis.
 
I have talked to many of the displaced who’ve told me how their lives have been completely upended.
 
I have met displaced mothers in Sudan who do not know where to find the next meal for their children.
 
I have met families sleeping in makeshift shelters, struggling to find food and water, unable to access health care, their children out of school and the family breadwinners out of work.
 
Half of Sudan’s population – 24.7 million people – now require humanitarian aid and protection as the conflict, displacement, and disease outbreaks threaten to consume the entire country.
 
The conflict has already crippled Sudan’s health sector with 70 per cent of all hospitals no longer functional.
 
The conflict could reach areas like Jazirah State, Sudan’s breadbasket. This would have grave consequences for food security.

And as the fighting spreads, we are receiving reports of increasing cases of sexual and gender- based violence, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and grave violations of human and children’s rights.
 
In recent weeks, another shock has hit Sudan as heavy rains and floods have affected more than 70,000 people across seven states [Northern, River Nile, North Darfur, Gedaref, White Nile, North Kordofan, and South Kordofan].
 
I am concerned that this could lead to more outbreaks of water-borne diseases. There is already a cholera outbreak declared in the eastern state of Gedaref, and we are investigating if it has spread to Khartoum and South Kordofan.
 
Battling a cholera outbreak in a warzone is difficult at the best of times. With fighting escalating, it may be near-impossible to control.
 
Four months ago [11 May] the parties meeting in Jeddah committed to de-escalate the fighting, minimize civilian harm and refrain from any disproportionate attacks. But since then, the killing of civilians has continued in Khartoum, Nyala, Al Fasher, and other areas.
 
Just two weeks ago scores were injured in an attack on a crowded market in southern Khartoum.
 
I call, once again, on the parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and take immediate steps to safeguard civilians.
 
The humanitarian response is a lifeline for millions of people.
 
UN aid organizations have reached at least 3.6 million people working with and through Sudanese humanitarian workers, civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations, including the Emergency Response Rooms. I applaud our Sudanese partners without whom little could have been achieved.
 
We have been able to deliver assistance through a cross-border mechanism from Chad and into Darfur. In mid-September, nearly 3,000 metric tons of aid supplies were delivered by 66 trucks across six states. But we need to be able to deliver much more – safely, repeatedly, and fast.
 
We need to reach 18 million people. We will not give up on that target. But we need more international support, better access to the people who need us, and safety for our operations.

Nineteen aid workers have been killed and 29 injured. It is unacceptable – and it is unlawful.
 
We also need to see an end to interference from the conflict parties in our operations, including forced checks of humanitarian trucks and mandatory military presence during the loading process in Port Sudan and Jazirah.
 
I hope that we will see swift action to reduce bureaucratic obstacles - including delays in visa approvals for staff - as promised by Sudanese authorities in a donor meeting yesterday.
 
Lastly, a word on funding: the $2.6 billion humanitarian appeal is just one third funded. I thank those donors who have stepped up and urge all donors to increase funding to bridge the funding gap for organizations providing critical assistance. This includes support for the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, which provides funding to our national partners.
 
The population of Sudan is balancing on a knife’s edge as their country is gradually consumed by this conflict.
 
We need the parties to live up to their commitments and to live up to their obligations.
 
And we need the world to show much more solidarity – or we may witness Sudan falling off the cliff.
 
Thank you.

Title: UNHCR, WHO warn of deteriorating health conditions as 1,200 children die of suspected measles, malnutrition in Sudan
Content: 19 September 2023
"The world has the means and the money to prevent every one of these deaths from measles or malnutrition."
GENEVA – UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and the World Health Organization (WHO) are again sounding the alarm on the worsening health situation caused by the Sudan crisis.
According to UNHCR teams in Sudan’s White Nile state, more than 1,200 refugee children under 5 have died in nine camps in the period between 15 May and 14 September, due to a deadly combination of a suspected measles outbreak and high malnutrition. Over 3,100 suspected cases were also reported in the same period and more than 500 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in other parts of the country, along with outbreaks of dengue and malaria, in a context of increased epidemic risk and challenges for epidemic control.
“The world has the means and the money to prevent every one of these deaths from measles or malnutrition,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said today. “And yet dozens of children are dying every day – a result of this devastating conflict and a lack of global attention. We can prevent more deaths, but need money for the response, access to those in need, and above all, an end to the fighting.”
Health facilities are under immense pressure due to shortages of staff, life-saving medicine and critical equipment. Repeated attacks on health facilities since the beginning of the conflict, including on personnel, patients, and transportation of medical supplies, are also impeding delivery of health services. The situation has brought health care in the country to its knees despite enormous efforts by local clinics and aid agencies to continue to provide much-needed health services.
“Local health workers, with the help of WHO and partners, are doing all they can, in very difficult conditions. But they desperately need the support of the international community to prevent further deaths and the spread of outbreaks,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We call on donors to be generous and on the warring parties to protect health workers and access to health for all those who need it.”
In Renk, South Sudan, humanitarian partners report increasing cases of children arriving with measles and high rates of malnutrition from Sudan, mainly from White Nile. The malnutrition situation in the country is deepening at a rapid scale.  Across South Sudan, over 5,770 suspected cases of measles have been reported with 142 deaths. Children younger than 5 are worst impacted, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of all cases and 76 per cent of all deaths. Half of the affected children were unvaccinated against measles, highlighting gaps in immunization, especially amongst returnees and refugees. On average 103 children per month were admitted to health facilities for moderate or severe malnutrition between May and July, up from 14 total admissions before the conflict.
The situation is just as worrisome in Ethiopia’s Amhara region, where a cholera outbreak in Metema is fast evolving in sites hosting over 18,000 people who have fled the conflict in Sudan. As of 12 September, eight people have died from cholera among 435 reported suspected cases. Cholera vaccine stocks for routine immunization are also running low, putting refugees at risk of further infections. The lack of ambulances to transport and refer patients for further care, insufficient medical equipment for treatment and a shortage of critical health staff are putting lives at risk and seriously hampering the humanitarian response.
In a recent screening exercise in Chad, nearly 13,000 children below 5 were found to be acutely malnourished. The number of children with malnutrition being admitted to hospitals has increased by 56 per cent across the province of Ouaddai, which is hosting more than 80 per cent of the refugees, since the beginning of the conflict in Sudan. The high prevalence of malnutrition among incoming refugees reflects the very dire situation of the people in Darfur, fleeing across to Chad.  In addition, acute respiratory infections, diarrhoea, and malaria remain the three most frequent illnesses among children. Access to clean drinking water is also a major challenge, with families only receiving five litres per person, only one-third of what is recommended.
UNHCR, WHO and partners are working to provide urgent assistance inside Sudan and across borders and prevent more deaths. Food distribution is ongoing and measles vaccinations have been provided for children under 5 in the camps in Blue and White Nile states vaccinating over 53,000 children under 5 years old. In Chad, two measles vaccination campaigns have already reached 1.2 million children. WHO and partners have also launched an oral cholera vaccination campaign in Amhara, Ethiopia, over the weekend. WHO is also supporting stabilization centres through the provision of supplies for the treatment of severe malnutrition. WHO has provided urgently needed health supplies across South Sudan, Ethiopia and Chad, including essential medicines, medical supplies for the treatment of cholera, malnutrition and tents for mobile health clinics. Reproductive health kits, mental health care and psychosocial support are also being prioritized. In Ethiopia, cholera kits have been dispatched to Metema and an isolation tent and a nursing station are being installed.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami
Content: 13 September 2023
Parties in Sudan must spare civilians
(Port Sudan): I am appalled by the killing of dozens of civilians in an attack on a crowded market in southern Khartoum on Sunday, 10 September 2023. Scores more were injured, many of them critically. This incident is just the latest example of the daily horrors that civilians in Sudan continue to face, especially in highly populated areas.  

Four months ago, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) signed the Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan. The very first commitment outlined in that document reads: “We agree that the interests and well-being of the Sudanese people are our top priority and affirm our commitment to ensure that civilians are protected at all times.” 

The ongoing killing of civilians in Khartoum, Nyala, Al Fasher and other areas underscores the fact that the parties to this conflict are not honouring the pledges they signed up to on 11 May or the fundamental rules of international law underpinning them. This includes the obligation to take all feasible precautions to avoid and minimize civilian harm and refrain from any disproportionate attack. 

I call on the SAF, RSF and all armed actors participating in the armed conflict to respect international humanitarian law and take immediate steps to safeguard civilians. The people of Sudan have suffered far too much already.

Title: FAO launches emergency response plan to protect and restore agricultural livelihoods amid conflict
Content: 11 September 2023
$123 million needed for urgent support to 10.1 million people in 17 most food-insecure states
Rome - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched an Emergency Livelihood Response Plan to address growing food insecurity in Sudan, providing communities with emergency seeds and livestock treatment kits, as well as  veterinary and fisheries support and equipment.
The Plan builds on FAO’s work to address extreme vulnerabilities triggered by the ongoing conflict on small-scale farming, herding and fishing communities. It complements FAO’s recently completed emergency seed distribution campaign. That initiative helped farmers maximize cereal production, avoid depletion of assets and promote seed diversification. The expected production will contribute to meet the cereal needs of at least 13 million and up to 19 million people for the upcoming 2023 harvest.
“Millions of people across the Sudan are facing a battle for survival as the food security crisis worsens”, said Hongjie Yang, FAO Representative in the Sudan.  “This emergency response plan aims to provide farming, herding and fishing families with the basics they need to keep production going and feed themselves and their communities.”
Seeds, animals and livestock vaccination campaigns
Under the plan, to support a total of 10.1 million people, households most in need will receive certified quality seeds – cowpea, groundnut, millet, okra and sorghum for the 2024 summer season, and chickpea, cucumber, pigeon pea, tomato and watermelon for the 2023 winter season. They will also receive training to adopt good agricultural practices, such as better handling of farm commodities after harvest.
Vulnerable people who have lost productive assets will be supported through the restocking of animals. This will result in immediate improvements to food security and nutrition, enabling herders to produce 4 to5 litres of milk/day.
Crucially, in a context of conflict, FAO’s plan will support the implementation of mass vaccination campaigns to protect 6 million sheep, goats and cattle against the most prevalent and devastating diseases, including peste des petits ruminants, sheep and goat pox and foot-and-mouth disease.
FAO also aims to assist 50 000 people (10 000 fishing households) with fishing inputs (such as fishing boats and gear) and related training, to ensure steady access to high-protein, quality foods and maintain functional local economies.
Much of the support to most vulnerable farming and livestock herding households will be delivered using a combination of unconditional cash assistance and livelihood input packages (seeds, tools, etc.) combined with training. This will help address the fact that during the dry season, spanning from November to May, farmers practicing rainfed agriculture face a “hunger gap”, while herding communities struggle with water scarcity, diminishing pastures and weakened animal health, leading to economic strain and a decrease in food consumption patterns.
Funding needs for implementation
In order to implement the plan over the next 12 months and reach the targeted farmers, herders and fishers in 17 of the Sudan’s most food-insecure states, FAO will require $123 million.
FAO last month warned about the severity of the escalating food crisis in the Sudan. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase (IPC) projections, over 20.3 million people, representing more than 42 percent of the population in the country, are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) between July and September 2023, nearly double the figure from May 2022. Nearly 14 million people are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and nearly 6.3 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of acute hunger. More information on the IPC hunger classification system can be found here.
The ongoing  violence has resulted in the displacement of over 3.8 million people across the country and forced more than 960 000 individuals to seek refuge in neighboring countries.

Title: War and hunger could destroy Sudan
Content: 25 August 2023
Statement by Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator
(New York): The war in Sudan is fueling a humanitarian emergency of epic proportions. This viral conflict – and the hunger, disease and displacement left in its wake – now threatens to consume the entire country.
The intense fighting that has ravaged the capital Khartoum and Darfur since mid-April has spread to Kordofan. In South Kordofan’s capital, Kadugli, food stocks have been fully depleted, as clashes and road blockages prevent aid workers from reaching the hungry. In West Kordofan’s capital, El Fula, humanitarian offices have been ransacked and supplies looted. I am also extremely worried about the safety of civilians in Al Jazira State, as the conflict moves closer to Sudan’s breadbasket.
The longer the fighting continues, the more devastating its impact. Some places have already run out of food. Hundreds of thousands of children are severely malnourished and at imminent risk of death if left untreated.
Vector-borne diseases are spreading, posing a lethal risk, especially to those already weakened by malnutrition. Cases of measles, malaria, whooping cough, dengue fever, and acute watery diarrhoea are being reported across the country. Most people have no access to medical treatment. The conflict has decimated the health care sector, with most hospitals out of service.
Millions of people have been displaced inside Sudan. Nearly one million others have fled across its borders. As more refugees arrive in neighbouring countries, host communities are struggling. A protracted conflict in Sudan could tip the entire region into a humanitarian catastrophe.
A long conflict will almost certainly lead to a lost generation of children as millions miss out on education, endure trauma, and bear the physical and psychological scars of war. Reports that some children in Sudan are being used in the fighting are deeply disturbing.
It is well past time for all those fighting in this conflict to put the people of Sudan above the pursuit of power or resources. Humanity must prevail. Civilians need life-saving assistance now; humanitarians need access and funding to deliver it. The international community needs to respond with the urgency this crisis deserves.

Title: More than two million children displaced by brutal conflict in Sudan as violence spreads to new areas
Content: 23 August 2023
With more children displaced in past 52 days than in previous four years combined, UNICEF warns that, without peace, the future of Sudan’s children is at stake.
PORT SUDAN – At least two million children have been forced from their homes since the conflict in Sudan erupted four months ago – an average of more than 700 children newly displaced every hour. As violence continues to ravage the country, over 1.7 million children are estimated to be on the move within Sudan’s borders and more than 470,000 have crossed into neighbouring countries.
“With over two million children uprooted by the conflict in only a few months, and countless more trapped in its merciless grip, the urgency of our collective response cannot be overstated,” said Mandeep O’Brien, UNICEF Country Representative in Sudan. “We are hearing unimaginable stories from children and families, some of whom lost everything and had to watch their loved ones die in front of their eyes. We said it before, and we are saying it again: we need peace now for children to survive.
At present, close to 14 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian support, many facing multiple threats and terrifying experiences every single day. Apart from conflict hotspots like Darfur and Khartoum, the heavy fighting has now spread to other populated areas, including in South and West Kordofan, limiting the delivery and access of lifesaving services to those in urgent need.
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification in Sudan (IPC) report estimates that 20.3 million people will be food insecure between July and September 2023 and expected to further exacerbate close to 10 million children’s health and nutrition status.
With the beginning of the rainy season, many houses have been destroyed by floods resulting in more families fleeing their areas. Moreover, the risk of disease outbreaks such as cholera, dengue, Rift Valley Fever and chikungunya, is significantly higher during the rainy period. Currently, more than 9.4 million children lack access to safe drinking water in Sudan and 3.4 million children under 5 are at high risk of diarrheal diseases and cholera.
Violence continues to obstruct the delivery of health and nutrition services, putting millions of children at risk. In Khartoum, the Darfur and Kordofan regions, fewer than one-third of health facilities are fully functional. Insecurity and displacement are also preventing patients and health workers from reaching hospitals, with many facilities being reportedly attacked and destroyed.
Health systems in the other 11 states are overwhelmed due to the massive displacement of populations from hotspots to these less-affected states. According to UNICEF sources, all states in Sudan are reporting severe shortage and stockout of medicines and supplies, including life-saving items.
In areas with high internal displacement and health systems stretched, such as the Blue and White Nile States, disease outbreaks, including measles, are resurfacing with reported associated deaths.
The lethal combination of measles and malnutrition is putting lives of children at a very high risk if urgent action is not taken. As conflict continues to ravage the country, almost 700,000 children with severe acute malnutrition are at high risk of not surviving without treatment, 1.7 million babies risk missing critical lifesaving vaccinations, and an entire generation of children will likely miss out on education. Millions of boys and girls will also lack safety and psychosocial well-being.
Over the last four months UNICEF has been providing health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), education and protection services to over 4 million children, mothers, and families across Sudan. In the next 100 days, UNICEF urgently needs US$400 million to sustain and scale its crisis response to support the most vulnerable children.
UNICEF continues to call on all parties involved in the conflict to prioritize the safety and well-being of children, ensure their protection, and enable unimpeded humanitarian access to affected areas. Lifesaving humanitarian support must be provided without delay to protect and safeguard the rights of millions of vulnerable children.

Title: Statement by Eddie Rowe, Humanitarian Coordinator a.i. in Sudan on World Humanitarian Day 2023
Content: 17 August 2023
Attacks on humanitarian workers in Sudan must stop now
Port Sudan - Since conflict erupted across Sudan in mid-April, the country has become one of the world’s most dangerous and difficult places for humanitarians to work, with 19 aid workers killed in 17 attacks this year alone. Ahead of World Humanitarian Day on 19 August, we mourn the loss of our beloved colleagues, call for perpetrators of attacks on aid workers and assistance to be held accountable, and once again remind parties to the conflict that humanitarians and the aid they deliver should never be a target.

The fighting that erupted in Sudan on 15 April immediately led to tragic consequences for the humanitarian community: That very day, three United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) staff who had been out in the field delivering emergency cash assistance were killed in Kebkabiya, North Darfur. Two other WFP employees were injured alongside them. And in the violent weeks that followed, humanitarians – all of them Sudanese – continued to lose their lives in the line of duty.

Their deaths are yet another sign that Sudan is being pulled back into one of the grimmest chapters in its history. Not since the height of the Darfur conflict between 2003 and 2006 has Sudan seen so many fatal attacks on aid workers. Humanitarian facilities have also been repeatedly attacked, with at least 53 warehouses looted, 87 offices ransacked, and 208 vehicles stolen as of 13 August.

International law is clear: The targeting of humanitarians is against the rules of war. Aid workers are neutral and impartial in conflict. Their role is to relieve the suffering of people caught up in crisis. Their safety – and that of the civilians they serve – must be guaranteed.

As the fighting in Sudan continues, humanitarians in the country remain committed to doing all we can to deliver life-saving assistance to millions of people in need, despite the challenges. We will continue to support local responders who are working tirelessly to provide food, water, shelter, education, health care and other essential services to their neighbours.
We will also continue to remind the parties to the conflict of their obligations under international humanitarian law, enshrined in the Declaration of Commitments signed in Jeddah on 11 May. They agreed then to protect the civilians of Sudan and to protect humanitarian personnel and assets. They affirmed that it is prohibited to attack, harass, intimidate, or arbitrarily detain personnel, or to attack, destroy, misappropriate, or loot relief supplies, installations, material, units, or vehicles. They must honour this commitment.

This World Humanitarian Day, we honour those who have fallen and the dedicated aid workers who continue to put their lives at risk every day to serve people in need. We continue to urge all parties to the conflict in Sudan to facilitate humanitarian action and to protect those who deliver it.

Title: Statement by Principals of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee: After 4 Months of War, Humanitarian Leaders Urge Action to End the Tragedy in Sudan
Content: 15 August 2023
NEW YORK/GENEVA/ROME – For four gruesome months, the people of Sudan have been engulfed in a war that is destroying their lives and their homeland, and violating their basic human rights.
People have witnessed their loved ones gunned down.
Women and girls have been sexually assaulted.
Families have seen their possessions looted and their homes burnt to the ground.
People are dying because they cannot access health care services and medicine.
And now, because of the war, Sudan’s children are wasting away for lack of food and nutrition.
Each day the fighting continues, the Sudanese are being robbed of the peace they cherish, the lives they are entitled to, and the future they deserve.
Enough.
After four months of terror, global leaders of humanitarian organizations working in Sudan have three messages to share:
It is time for a reset. We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities. The people of Sudan need peace and equitable access to humanitarian relief. And the international community must step up today, engage at all levels, and act to put Sudan back on track and end the war.

Title: Sudan: Turk decries “disastrous” impact of war, urges accountability
Content: 15 August 2023
"Disastrous, senseless” war in Sudan – borne out of a wanton drive for power – has resulted in thousands of deaths, the destruction of family homes, schools, hospitals and other essential services, massive displacement, as well as sexual violence, in acts which may amount to war crimes."
GENEVA – The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said today the “disastrous, senseless” war in Sudan – borne out of a wanton drive for power – has resulted in thousands of deaths, the destruction of family homes, schools, hospitals and other essential services, massive displacement, as well as sexual violence, in acts which may amount to war crimes.
The UN Human Rights Office has reasonable grounds to believe that the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have committed serious violations of international law during the ongoing conflict, now entering its fifth month, including violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, and perpetrators must be held accountable, he said.
Türk expressed grave concerns that the chaotic situation, mired in impunity, is ripe for exploitation by other opportunistic armed actors and militia groups – and the violence may escalate further as a result.
Areas worst affected by fighting include Khartoum and nearby cities, El Obeid in North Kordofan and areas of the Darfur region, in particular West Darfur, where the conflict has been characterized by attacks against civilians based on their ethnicity.
While it is difficult to establish an exact number of casualties due to the intensity of the fighting and the fact that the remains of many of those killed have not been collected, identified or buried, tentative figures indicate that more than 4,000 people have so far been killed, including hundreds of civilians. These include 28 humanitarian and health workers and 435 children. The actual number of casualties is believed to be much higher.
“Many civilians were reportedly killed in the Khartoum area as they resisted attempts by the RSF to loot their houses or rape female family members,” Türk said, adding many others have been killed in crossfire or as a result of shells hitting their homes. “In West Darfur’s El Geneina, people were killed in their homes as well as while they were trying to reach safety elsewhere in El Geneina or on the road to Chad.
“My Office has also received credible reports of 32 incidents of sexual violence against 73 victims as of 2 August. This includes at least 28 incidents of rape. Men in RSF uniform were implicated in at least 19 incidents as perpetrators. The actual number of cases is likely much higher. I have urged senior officials in Sudan – during my visit there and repeatedly since then – to issue clear instructions to all those under their command that there is zero tolerance for sexual violence. Perpetrators must be held accountable and such violence must be clearly and unequivocally condemned.”
Hundreds of individuals, including political activists and human rights defenders, have been detained arbitrarily and held incommunicado by both parties to the conflict. In Khartoum alone, at least 500 people, including 24 women, were reported to be missing as of the end of July. Many of those detained have been ill-treated, and in some cases tortured.
Since May, food insecurity has nearly doubled, affecting more than 20.3 million people, and at least 700,000 children are now at risk of acute malnutrition and mortality. The economy is in freefall, and the health system in crisis. In early August, the Sudanese Ministry of Health announced that 100 out of 130 hospitals in Khartoum were out of service.
As of 8 August, more than 4 million people have been displaced due to the fighting. Most are reported to be living in dire humanitarian conditions, making women and girls in the refugee camps and IDP sites more vulnerable to sexual abuse.
Witnesses interviewed by the UN Human Rights Office have also accused the two parties of denying civilians safe passage to flee the fighting, or to evacuate the injured, particularly in the south of Khartoum, in East Nile, and in Omdurman. In El Geneina, the RSF and its allied militia have prevented injured people from being taken to medical facilities.
The UN Human Rights Office has also received testimonies of unlawful killing, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, among other violations.
“The parties to the conflict must immediately stop the fighting, resume political talks, comply with their legal obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack, and allow an uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian assistance,” the UN Human Rights Chief said.
“They must investigate all the violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law that have occurred during the conflict, in accordance with relevant international standards and hold those responsible accountable.
“I also urge the international community to increase political and economic pressure on the parties to the conflict to stop immediately the fighting, and increase financial support for humanitarian agencies responding to the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict, including displacement and refugee crises.”

Title: WFP delivers first food assistance to West Darfur as Sudan conflict pushes record numbers of people into hunger
Content: 11 August 2023
This is a summary of what was said by Eddie Rowe, WFP’s Country Director for Sudan (speaking from Port Sudan via Zoom) – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
GENEVA – The United Nations World Food Programme’s (WFP) fears about record levels of hunger in Sudan have been confirmed. Shortly after the conflict broke out in April, WFP forecast that hunger would rise to engulf more than 19 million people in the coming months. Now, nearly four months since the conflict started, that grim prediction has proved to be a harsh reality.
As my FAO colleague said, the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis shows that the conflict has pushed over 20 million people into severe acute hunger. That is around 42 percent of Sudan’s population. Of that figure, 6.3 million people are experiencing IPC4 or emergency levels of hunger. That is one step away from famine.
Over the last four months I have briefed you regularly on what WFP is doing in Sudan to urgently deliver food assistance to the families that desperately need it. The operating environment in Sudan is without a doubt the most challenging that I have experienced in my career, which spans more than 30-years with WFP. Since mid-April, the conflict has continued to spread, and its dynamics have become increasingly more complex. Gaining access to people in need of life-saving food assistance has also become more challenging and increasingly urgent.
Last week we had a major breakthrough. For the first time, WFP was able to deliver food assistance in West Darfur State. A convoy of five trucks transporting 125 tonnes of food commodities travelled from eastern Chad to West Darfur where we delivered one month’s worth of food assistance to around 15,400 people in the villages of Adikong, Shukri, and Jarabi.
It is our hope that this route from Chad will become a regular humanitarian corridor to reach these families in West Darfur, especially in Geneina – the capital of West Darfur - where lives have been torn apart by the violence. The situation in the Darfurs, and particularly in West and Central Darfur, is catastrophic. Our teams passed through towns and villages that are abandoned following a mass exodus of people. Health facilities, banks and other critical infrastructure are destroyed.
Those that remain are mostly women and their children who are acutely vulnerable and have not fled because they are too scared. Their husbands have been killed, injured, or have gone missing. These families are barely surviving. Most are only eating just one meal a day, sharing what food they have with neighbours and selling what they own simply to afford food. Some markets are beginning to reopen with limited food coming in from Chad. But food is their most urgent need.
Since the conflict started, WFP has delivered emergency food and nutrition assistance to 1.6 million people across Sudan. This includes people trapped by the fighting in Khartoum State, the Kordofans, and across the Darfurs.
Providing assistance in Khartoum State remains extremely challenging due to ongoing fighting. The situation is volatile, and we have to seize often brief windows of calm to get our trucks into these areas and to safely deliver the food assistance into the hands of people who need it. WFP has so far assisted over 150,000 in the greater Khartoum area (Karari, Ombada, Omdurman, Jalal Awlia) since the end of May and we are continuing to scale up assistance to people who are fleeing Sudan's capital to neighbouring states such as Gezira, Northern, and River Nile. Today, we have trucks carrying another 460 metric tons of food assistance heading to Jalal Awlia in the Khartoum area.
To support the entire humanitarian community operating within this very challenging environment, WFP is providing common services, such as emergency telecommunications, for 19 UN agencies and 15 I/NGOs. The WFP- run UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) has transported over 1,500 humanitarian workers in and out of Port Sudan since the conflict erupted.
We are doing everything possible to expand access and increase assistance in Darfur and across Sudan. We are planning further assessment missions into West Darfur from Chad and negotiating access to other remote areas in Darfur. We urgently call on all parties to the conflict to facilitate humanitarian access and enable the safe delivery of assistance at this critical time when millions in Sudan are struggling with rising hunger and living on the brink of survival.

Title: Civilians Fleeing Sudan’s War Need Safe Passage. The Parties to the Conflict Must Ensure It.
Content: 09 August 2023
Statement by Clementine Nkweta-Salami, Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan
(Port Sudan): In the fourth month of the worsening conflict in Sudan, civilians – including refugees – continue to endure horrific violations. The killing and targeting of vulnerable people held hostage by this ongoing war are unacceptable and must stop immediately.
Many of those trapped by the fighting have been unable – and in some cases actively prevented – from seeking safety elsewhere. And those that can escape face other dangers: They are vulnerable to abuse, theft and harassment during their journeys to safer areas.
Last week, I met Eritrean refugees who had been living in the capital Khartoum, until the fighting forced them to leave for the Wad Sharife settlement in Kassala state. They spoke of the dangers involved in leaving the capital and their fears of being harassed during the passage. All people fleeing the fighting in Sudan must be able to do so in safety. The Sudanese people, as well as refugees in the country, have the right to seek safety in Sudan or in neighbouring countries. I appeal to all parties to ensure this fundamental right is upheld.
In Khartoum, the killing of 28 refugees during heavy clashes on 25 June was yet another stark reminder of the horrors that refugee communities are facing. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, continues to help refugees stranded in Sudan’s capital by providing protection counselling via hotlines and trying to find ways to safely relocate them whenever possible. But access is exceedingly difficult, and needs are growing by the day.
In West Darfur, we have received reports that some civilians trying to flee intense clashes in Sirba town on 26 July were prevented from crossing the border into Chad. UNHCR has also recorded a number of cases in which refugees trying to flee the flighting in Sudan, notably to return back home to South Sudan, have faced difficulties along the route.
The parties to the conflict in Sudan must ensure the safe passage of civilians fleeing violence in Khartoum, Darfur and other areas of active hostilities. This is what was agreed in Jeddah on 11 May by the signatories to the Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan, and the parties must follow through on their commitments to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law.
After sixteen weeks of conflict in Sudan, more than 4 million people have been displaced within the country and across borders into neighbouring countries. Over 71 per cent of the more than 3 million people internally displaced in Sudan fled from Khartoum state, according to the International Organization for Migration. Before this crisis, there were 1.1 million refugees in Sudan, mainly from South Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia.
My message as Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan is unequivocal: All civilians, including refugees and others, who are trying to escape conflict zones must be allowed to do so safely, without impediments, and under the protection of the parties to the conflict.

Title: Food security crisis intensifies amid ongoing conflict and economic challenges
Content: 02 August 2023
Urgent scale up of emergency humanitarian support to rural communities needed
Cairo/Khartoum – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) raises a dire warning about the escalating food crisis in the Sudan. As conflict and economic decline continue to ravage the country, urgent and intensified humanitarian support for rural communities is urgently needed.
According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase (IPC) projections, over 20.3 million people, representing more than 42 percent of the population in the country, are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) between July and September 2023. Compared to the results from the last IPC analysis conducted in May 2022, the number of highly food insecure people has nearly doubled.
With 14 million people facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and nearly 6.3 million people facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of acute hunger, the situation is critical. The states most severely affected are grappling with active conflict, including Khartoum, South and West Kordofan, and Central, East, South and West Darfur, where over half of the population is facing acute hunger.
The violence has resulted in the large-scale displacement of over 2.6 million people across the country and forced over 700 000 individuals to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Critical infrastructure, including healthcare facilities, power sources, and telecommunications, has suffered significant damage, further exacerbating food insecurity and malnutrition. Market disruptions and soaring food prices have compounded the population's struggle to access essential goods and services.
FAO's Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for the Near East and North Africa, Abdulhakim Elwaer, expressed his deep concern about the situation, stating, "The conflict has had devastating consequences on the food and nutrition security and well-being of millions of people. Families are facing unimaginable suffering, and it is vital that FAO is stepping in to support more than 1 million farmers this season to produce enough food for Sudanese people."
FAO’s response
FAO's response to the crisis has been swift and comprehensive. Despite the complex security conditions, the Organization has procured 8 840 tonnes of cereal (sorghum and millet) and okra seed, reaching more than half million farming households across the country with the support of the Government of the United States of America, Norway, Germany and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the Central Emergency Response Fund. The emergency seed distribution campaign aims to expand to reach up to 1 million farmers in time for the planting season, ensuring sufficient cereal production to cover the needs of up to 19 million people for a year.
With the support of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), FAO became the first UN agency to reach West Kordofan since the conflict began. This milestone has facilitated access to North, East, and South Darfur, allowing FAO to broaden its assistance to vulnerable communities.
FAO's efforts to combat the food crisis are hampered by limited resources. The Organization urgently requires USD 65 million to reach 1 255 000 vulnerable households (almost 6.3 million people) and provide agropastoral households with quality seeds and training for the 2023 winter and 2024 summer farming seasons; restore and improve access to milk for pastoral households; protect the livestock assets of vulnerable households through animal vaccinations; and provide fishing gear and equipment to support the livelihoods of vulnerable fishing households.
Looking ahead
The projections for the upcoming period from October 2023 to February 2024 paint a concerning picture, with around 15 million people likely to face IPC Phase 3 or above levels of acute food insecurity— the highest recorded figure coinciding with the country’s harvesting season. Greater Darfur, Greater Kordofan, and Khartoum State are expected to be the regions with the highest number of people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency). During this period, millet and sorghum harvests are expected to increase slightly, which will help replenish household stocks, improve livestock health, and enhance milk production. However, this improvement may not be sufficient to meet the growing food needs, especially in states heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture. The high cost of agricultural inputs (seeds, tools, fertilizer), labour and disrupted agricultural activities are threatening crop production and exacerbating the food crisis.
"We remain committed to supporting rural families in the Sudan during these challenging times. But this crucial work cannot be sustained without timely resources. Agriculture is a lifeline; and as the main agriculture season begins, urgent action is required to prevent further deterioration of the food security situation and to save lives and livelihoods,” said Hongjie Yang, FAO Representative in the Sudan.
FAO is on the frontlines working with local partners and the humanitarian community to provide lifesaving assistance to vulnerable rural communities in the Sudan.

Title: Health needs heighten as Sudan conflicts displaces millions of people
Content: 27 July 2023
The sheer scale of the health crisis is enormous. We are working hard to step up our response, delivering critical medical and other emergency health supplies.

Brazzaville/Cairo – The conflict in Sudan that has forced 3.4 million people to flee for safety within the country and across its borders is rapidly intensifying health threats, with cases of infectious diseases and other afflictions reported among the displaced population who have sought refuge in hard-to-reach locations with limited health services.
Among those uprooted from their homes, nearly 760 000 have sought refuge in neighbouring Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan, where World Health Organization (WHO) and partners are supporting national authorities to provide emergency health assistance.
In Sudan itself, the health crisis has reached gravely serious levels as more than two-thirds of hospitals remain out of service amid increasing reports of attacks on health facilities. Between 15 April and 24 July 2023, WHO verified 51 attacks on health facilities, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries—and cutting off access to urgently needed care.
“The sheer scale of the health crisis is enormous. We are working hard to step up our response, delivering critical medical and other emergency health supplies,” said Dr Nima Saeed Abid, WHO Representative in Sudan. “Although the attacks on health facilities and the widespread insecurity are compounding the challenges, we’re determined to reach those most in need and urge for increased donor support to ensure that we deliver adequately.”
Across the border in Chad, which is receiving an average of 2500 people daily--accounting for most of the people forced to flee across borders from Sudan—WHO and partner organizations have identified and treated more than 1400 trauma cases. That includes over 60 major surgeries. About 70% of trauma cases are due to gunshot wounds. Additionally, malaria, malnutrition and cholera infections are also being reported among the displaced.
“The conflict in Sudan is triggering a health crisis affecting an entire region,” said Dr Jean-Bosco Ndihokubwayo, WHO Representative in Chad. “Chad alone is currently hosting more than a quarter of a million people and an equal number of people are projected to arrive in the country by the end of this year. This will significantly increase the health needs and exert huge pressure on the available health facilities.”
Cases of malaria among children under five years of age, as well as suspected cases of yellow fever have also been identified among the about 17 000 people who have sought refuge in the Central African Republic, while a suspected cholera outbreak has been reported in locations in northern Ethiopia receiving large number of displaced people.
The influx of more than 176 000 people into South Sudan has overstretched facilities in the northern Renk region, where an upsurge of acute watery diarrhoea among under-five-year-olds is driving up mortality. There is also a significant rise in severe acute malnutrition as well as measles among children below five years.
To adequately respond to the crisis, WHO in June issued an emergency appeal for US$ 145 million. Thus far it has received only about 10% of the funds, and with little prospects of peace, the health crisis is likely to grow even further.
WHO is working with partners to deliver emergency assistance swiftly. So far, it has shipped over 36 tons of supplies to Chad, where an emergency medical team has also been deployed. The Organization has also delivered emergency medical and non-medical supplies to provide care to the affected populations in Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Egypt and South Sudan. In addition, disease Surveillance is being enhanced to guide prevention and enable early detection of potential outbreaks. WHO is also providing technical support to national authorities to strengthen the emergency health response.
With scarce, overstretched and at times inexistent health facilities in the locations hosting the people fleeing the armed violence in Sudan, WHO and partners are supporting national health authorities to enhance provision of basic health services. Improving water, sanitation and hygiene services, carrying out vaccination drives, as well as strengthening infection prevention and control are some of the priority health interventions.
Dr Abid and Dr Ndihokubwayo spoke today during a virtual press briefing. They were joined by Dr Naeema Al Gasseer, WHO Representative in Egypt; Dr Dlamini Nonhlahla, WHO Representative in Ethiopia; and Dr Magdalene Armah, WHO Regional Office for Africa Incident Manager for the Sudan crisis.
Also on hand from WHO Regional Office for Africa to respond to questions were Dr Patrick Otim, Health Emergency Officer; and Dr Charles Njuguna, Regional Advisor, Country Readiness Strengthening.

Title: After 100 days of fighting, attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers must stop - Statement by Clementine Nkweta-Salami, Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan
Content: 25 July 2023
‎
Port Sudan - Yesterday marked 100 days since the eruption of war in Sudan, a crisis that turned a dire humanitarian situation into a full-blown catastrophe. It is a devastating situation, with the surging violations increasing the suffering of civilians. Thousands of people have been killed and injured. More than 3.3 million people have fled their homes in search of safer areas, both inside and outside Sudan. Many more remain without the most basic services – water, health care and food.
The humanitarian community remains steadfast in its commitment to support the people of Sudan, making tremendous and brave efforts to provide assistance amid very difficult circumstances.
Yet relief workers are not spared from the horrendous acts of violence and abuse. Humanitarians, including health workers, should never be a target, and it is shocking to receive reports of attacks against them.
Sadly, at least 18 aid workers have been killed and many more injured since the start of the conflict in Sudan. More than two dozen have been detained while some remain unaccounted for. Humanitarian facilities have also been attacked, with at least 50 humanitarian warehouses having been looted, 82 offices ransacked and more than 200 vehicles stolen. The looting of one warehouse in Al Obeid alone in early June left us without food that could have fed 4.4 million people.
The health sector has been devastated. More than 50 attacks on health care have been verified since the violence in Sudan broke out, resulting in 10 deaths and 21 injuries. There were 32 attacks reported on health facilities and 22 targeting health workers.
I strongly condemn all of these attacks: They must stop so that the humanitarian community can continue to deliver essential aid and stop the further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. All the parties to the conflict must adhere to international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including the protection of all civilians and civilian infrastructure, as well as the unhindered and safe access for humanitarian personnel and supplies across the country.

Title: Severe violations of children’s rights an ‘hourly occurrence’ in Sudan, warns UNICEF
Content: 23 July 2023
PORT SUDAN/NEW YORK – As the brutal conflict in Sudan hits 100-days, UNICEF has received reports of a staggering 2,500 severe violations of children’s rights - an average of at least one an hour. As these are just the numbers reported to UNICEF sources, the true figure is likely to be far higher, and a grim reminder of the day-to-day impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable, in a country where almost 14 million children need humanitarian support.  

“The scale of the impact that this conflict has had on children in Sudan in the past 100 days is almost beyond comprehension,” said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director for Humanitarian Action and Supply Operations, who is in Sudan this week. “Parents and grandparents who lived through previous cycles of violence are now having to watch their children and grandchildren experience similar horrific experiences. Each and every day, children are being killed, injured, abducted, and seeing the schools, hospitals and the vital infrastructure and life-saving supplies they rely on damaged, destroyed or looted.”

At least 435 children have been reported killed in the conflict, and at least 2,025 children injured. 

In addition to those killed and injured, UNICEF has received alarming reports of escalating attacks against health facilities in parts of Sudan. An estimated 68 per cent of hospitals in the worst-affected areas have had to suspend service and at least 17 hospitals have reportedly been bombed. Several more hospitals are believed to have been turned into military bases, and there have been repeated reports of ambulances coming under attack.

Over three months into the conflict, millions of families have been uprooted from their homes by the violence. Before the crisis, nearly 3.8 million people were internally displaced in Sudan, 1.9 million of whom were children. 1.7 million additional children have been driven from their homes and are now on the move within Sudan and crossing its borders, vulnerable to hunger, disease, violence, and separation from their families. Reports of abductions, recruitment of children into armed groups, ethnically targeted violence, and gender-based violence against women and girls are also on the rise, with 4.2 million women and girls at risk of Gender-Based Violence.

Restricted movement due to the security situation, administrative barriers and bureaucratic impediments and the denial of humanitarian access, remain key obstacles to delivering much needed aid to those in desperate need and pose a threat to aid workers. Combined with the destruction and looting of critical supplies and facilities, this has left at least 690,000 children exposed to severe acute malnutrition and 1.7 million children under the age of one risk missing critical vaccinations, raising the risk of disease outbreaks.

“The past 100 days have shown that—as in any conflict—the direct and indirect impacts for children and families are devastating, and without concerted action, including the commitment of the parties to the conflict to stop the fighting and uphold international law, severe violations of children’s rights will only worsen,” said Chaiban. “Without guaranteed, safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian workers, and life-saving supplies, along with urgently needed additional funding, the futures of millions of children will remain in the balance.”

Despite the challenges, over the past 100 days UNICEF, with partners, has reached over 3 million children and women with health supplies, 1.4 million people with safe drinking water, and 1.7 million children with screening for malnutrition—of which 82,000 received life-saving treatment. In addition, almost 100,000 children and caregivers are benefitting from psycho-social counselling and protection support, including through over 400 safe-spaces established across the country.

To date, UNICEF delivered over 5,500 metric tons of life-saving supplies across Sudan, including in hotspot areas in Darfur, Kordofan, and Khartoum. However, while fighting continues, needs will only increase, with many vulnerable communities remain out of reach of humanitarian support.

As of mid-July, the UNICEF appeal for US$838 million to reach almost 10 million of the most vulnerable children in Sudan is only 9 per cent funded. UNICEF urgently needs $400 million to sustain and scale up critical life-saving health, nutrition, water, sanitation, learning and protection assistance to the most vulnerable children caught in this crisis over the next 100 days.

Title: Emergency seed distribution kick off leveraging the ongoing planting season to boost food production
Content: 13 July 2023
From FAO Regional Office for Near East and North Africa
Cairo/Khartoum – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has kicked off its emergency seeds distribution campaign to reach farmers in key regions, ensuring that they have the necessary resources to meet food production needs. This comes as a response to the urgency of the ongoing main crop production season (June – October 2023) in the country. With the support of USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, and the Central Emergency Response Fund, FAO plans to reach and assist over one million vulnerable farmers and their families (5 million people) with 10 000 tonnes of sorghum, millet, groundnut and sesame seeds for planting across 17 States.
To date, FAO has delivered 3,300 tonnes of seeds to 8 states (Blue Nile, Gedarif, Kassala, Sennar, White Nile, Red Sea, South Kordofan, North Kordofan) and started the distribution to farmers. FAO is committed to continue delivery and distribution of these urgent seeds amidst the security and logistics challenges.
“The need for swift agricultural support in the Sudan is paramount. While much work lies ahead, we are fully committed to leveraging this crucial planting season's window of opportunity and our efforts on the ground continue daily," stated Hongjie Yang, FAO Representative in Sudan. "Our goal is to navigate the complex security and logistical challenges to continue to reach farmers in the country with this time-sensitive assistance."
The Organization’s emergency seed distribution will allow vulnerable farmers to plant and produce enough food (up to 3 million tonnes of cereals) between November–December 2023 to cover the cereal requirements of around 13-19 million people.
FAO remains steadfast in its mission to save livelihoods and lives and ensure food access and production in the Sudan. By bolstering local food production and safeguarding agrifood systems, the Organization aims to alleviate acute food insecurity, reduce human suffering and curb the likely expanding humanitarian burden in the coming months.
To date, FAO has raised nearly $20 million against the total of $95.4 million to reach 15 million people with multiple life-saving interventions including providing farmers with seeds and farming equipment and protecting and restocking pastoralists’ livestock herds.

Title: At least 87 buried in mass grave in Darfur as Rapid Support Forces deny victims decent burials
Content: 13 July 2023
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk today called on the RSF and other parties to the conflict to allow and facilitate prompt searches for the dead, their collection and evacuation without distinction, including based on ethnic background - as they are obliged to do under international law.
GENEVA – The bodies of at least 87 ethnic Masalit and others allegedly killed last month by Rapid Support Forces and their allied militia in West Darfur have been buried in a mass grave outside the region’s capital El-Geneina on the orders of the Rapid Support Forces, according to credible information obtained by the UN Human Rights Office.
Local people were forced to dispose of the bodies in a mass grave, denying those killed a decent burial in one of the city’s cemeteries. At least 37 bodies were buried on 20 June in the approximately one-metre-deep mass grave in an open area called Al-Turab Al Ahmar (Red Soil), in the Ranga area, about two to four kilometres northwest of the headquarters of the Central Reserve Police in western El-Geneina, sources said. Another 50 bodies were buried at the same site on 21 June. The bodies of seven women and seven children were among those buried.
According to credible information gathered by the Office, those buried in the mass grave were killed by RSF and their allied militia around 13-21 June in El-Geneina’s Al-Madaress and Al-Jamarek districts and include many victims of the violence that followed the killing of Khamis Abbaker, the Governor of West Darfur, on 14 June, shortly after he was taken into custody by the RSF. They also include individuals who died from untreated injuries.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk today called on the RSF and other parties to the conflict to allow and facilitate prompt searches for the dead, their collection and evacuation without distinction, including based on ethnic background - as they are obliged to do under international law.
“I condemn in the strongest terms the killing of civilians and hors de combat individuals, and I am further appalled by the callous and disrespectful way the dead, along with their families and communities, were treated,” Türk said. “There must be a prompt, thorough and independent investigation into the killings, and those responsible must be held to account.”
Witnesses said that local mediation efforts for access to and burial of the dead have generally taken long, leaving many bodies lying in the streets for days on end. One family said it had to wait 13 days before being allowed to collect the body of a family member, a Masalit dignitary killed on or around 9 June by the RSF and their allied militia.
Witnesses told the UN Human Rights Office that in the instances where the RSF have allowed the collection of the dead – following mediation with Arab and other community leaders – they have refused to allow the removal of the injured to hospitals for medical treatment.
“The RSF’s leadership and their allied militia as well as all parties to an armed conflict are required to ensure that the dead are properly handled, and their dignity protected,” Türk said.
The RSF must record, or allow relief workers to record, all available information related to the dead, including taking proper photos of the bodies and marking the location of the graves, with a view to identification to facilitate the return of the remains of the deceased to the families upon their request.
Under international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all parties to the conflict must ensure the injured receive medical care.
The High Commissioner called on the RSF leadership immediately and unequivocally to condemn and stop the killing of people, and to end violence and hate speech against people on the basis of their ethnicity.

Title: After 28 refugee deaths in Khartoum, UNHCR urges Sudan’s warring parties to allow safe passage for civilians
Content: 04 July 2023
Prior to the killing of the 28 refugees, more than 500 refugees attempting to escape the conflict in Khartoum and other affected locations were reportedly intercepted by armed groups on their way to safety and prevented from proceeding.
GENEVA — UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is deeply concerned by continued reports of civilians in Sudan, including both internally displaced populations and refugees caught up in the ongoing conflict, becoming indiscriminate casualties of the fighting and being prevented from seeking safety.
It has now been confirmed that on 25 June, 28 refugees hosted by Sudan were killed in Khartoum when the area in which they lived was engulfed by the fighting, with additional refugees injured in the incident. UNHCR is appalled and expresses its deepest condolences to the affected families. We are working to help trace relatives and victims and provide psychosocial and other support.
“Once again, refugees and other civilians are the innocent victims of this tragic war. Both sides must allow civilians to move freely to safer places, ensuring their protection and well-being and respecting their fundamental human rights,” said Mamadou Dian Balde, UNHCR’s Regional Director for the East and Horn of Africa and Great Lakes Region. “Everyone must honour international humanitarian law and human rights law and prioritize the safety and well-being of affected communities, including refugees.”
Despite countless calls for all parties to protect non-combatants, innocent civilians including refugees are still being compelled to flee the fighting in extremely dangerous circumstances, and are subjected to harassment, abuse, theft and other criminal acts. Prior to the killing of the 28 refugees, more than 500 refugees attempting to escape the conflict in Khartoum and other affected locations were reportedly intercepted by armed groups on their way to safety and prevented from proceeding. According to the refugees, their belongings were confiscated and the vehicles they were using were seized, leaving them vulnerable and without access to basic necessities such as drinking water and with no means of transport, impeding their passage out of the city.
In West Darfur, where conflict is intensifying, there have also been unconfirmed reports of people being prevented from leaving El Geneina in search of safety, including across the border into Chad. These incidents are unacceptable and underscore the immense challenges faced by civilians seeking safety and security away from conflict zones.
UNHCR is continuously monitoring the situation of refugees stranded in Khartoum, providing protection counselling through hotlines, and striving to assist them to find safety and means to relocate away from areas affected by the fighting, as the situation allows.
After nine weeks of conflict in Sudan, more than two and a half million people have been displaced within the country and across borders into neighbouring countries. Before this crisis, there were 1.1 million refugees in Sudan, mainly from South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Syria.

Title: Women and girls hit hard by attacks on health in Sudan, UN agencies warn
Content: 20 June 2023
Among the 11 million people in Sudan who need urgent health assistance are 2.64 million women and girls of reproductive age.
New York - The World Health Organization and UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, today warned that the continuing attacks on healthcare facilities, equipment and workers  in Sudan are depriving women and girls of life-saving healthcare, with pregnant women hardest hit.
Some 67% of hospitals in areas affected by fighting are closed, and several maternity hospitals are out of action, including Omdurman Hospital, the largest referral hospital in Sudan. Among the 11 million people in Sudan who need urgent health assistance are 2.64 million women and girls of reproductive age. Some 262 880 of them are pregnant and over 90 000 will give birth in the next three months. All of them need access to critical reproductive health services.
Since April, when the fighting began, WHO has verified 46 attacks on health workers and facilities which have killed eight people and injured 18 others.  Facilities and health assets have also been looted, and health workers have been subjected to violence. A number of health facilities are being used by armed forces.
There are reports of a military occupation of the National Medical Supply Funds (NMSF) warehouses in the capital, Khartoum, where medicines for the entire country, including malaria medicines, are kept, and where the national pharmacy for chronic diseases is located. WHO’s stock of emergency medical supplies and development products is kept at its warehouse on the premises. UNFPA’s stocks of medicines and equipment for obstetric care, post-rape treatment, as well as a wide range of contraceptives, which are stored at warehouses in Khartoum, South Darfur, West Darfur and elsewhere are also inaccessible. Health facilities in several states, including the Darfurs, have warned that they are facing critical shortages of medical supplies.
In a worrying development, hospitals are running out of fuel to power generators that provide electricity. Six newborns died at a hospital in the city of Eld’aeen in East Darfur in the space of a week due to issues including a lack of oxygen amid electricity blackouts and local doctors estimated that more  than 30 newborns have died at the hospital since the start of the fighting. In May, UNFPA and local partner, the CAFA Development Organization, provided fuel for seven maternity hospitals in Khartoum to ensure health services were available for women and newborns. In just one week, more than 1000 deliveries and caesarean sections were safely carried out. But more support is desperately needed to secure fuel and supplies for key hospitals to sustain essential services. Some 15% of pregnant women experience pregnancy- and birth-related complications and need access to emergency obstetric and newborn care.
UNFPA provides sexual and reproductive healthcare through health facilities and hospitals throughout Sudan. UNFPA-trained midwives continue to support women to give birth safely at home and at functioning health facilities. There are approximately 27 000 midwives working across Sudan; around 2330 in the capital. Most of them attend 3–4 births a day, according to the head of a UNFPA-supported midwife network. UNFPA is also setting up safe spaces for women to provide gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response services, including post-rape treatment, counselling and case management; as well as providing remote services. UNFPA also trains service providers and community-based protection networks in GBV prevention and response.
WHO is working closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners to ensure provision of essential sexual, reproductive, maternal and paediatric care as well as emergency obstetric and neo-natal care in Khartoum and Gezira, and in states sheltering internally displaced people. WHO is providing life-saving medicines and supplies, and covering the running cost of health facilities that provide these services. WHO is also training health workers on first-line support, provision of post-rape treatment and mental health care to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (GBV), and is backing national NGOs that provide GBV services.
“Health facilities, health workers and patients must be protected, and a woman’s right to reproductive healthcare must be upheld,” said UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Natalia Kanem. “People who need urgent health services should not be afraid to step out of their homes for fear of their safety. The conflict in Sudan must stop and until that happens, humanitarian and medical aid must be allowed through,” she added.

Title: Acute food insecurity sparked by the ongoing crisis is set to escalate in coming months
Content: 19 June 2023
FAO urgently requires $95.4 million to scale up response to save lives, enable access to food and protect vital livelihoods
Rome/Khartoum – The current crisis in Sudan has worsened an already dire food insecurity situation, with hunger expected to increase substantially across the country as it heads into the typical lean season period from June to September.
To scale up its response, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) urgently requires $95.4 million to reach 15 million people with multiple life-saving interventions including providing farmers with seeds and farming equipment and protecting and restocking pastoralists’ livestock herds.
FAO’s immediate plan is to assist over one million vulnerable farmers and their families (totalling five million people) between now and the end of July with cereal seeds (sorghum, millet) and okra seeds for planting in June to July 2023 in the country’s 14 states. Additionally, from July until the end of the year, FAO aims to target 1.3 million pastoralists with livestock services and inputs to strengthen the food security and nutrition of 6.5 million people.
The Organization’s emergency seed distribution, totalling 9 600 tonnes to the most vulnerable farming households in June and July, will allow vulnerable farmers to plant and produce enough food (up to 3 million tonnes of cereals) in November–December 2023 to cover the cereal requirements of between 13 and 19 million people.
“We are doing everything we can to utilize the relatively calm conditions in rural areas and the current planting season to rapidly increase local food production and availability, save lives and avoid more people sliding into acute food insecurity,” said Adam Yao, FAO Representative a.i in Sudan.
FAO remains operational in the country’s 14 state offices. State authorities and local community leaders, as well as 40 national implementing partners continue to confirm their readiness to resume operations and support FAO emergency seed distribution.
Food security situation remains dire
In 2022, the number of people at crisis or worse levels (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification [IPC] Phase 3+) during the lean season was estimated at 11.7 million. Given the likely ripple effects of displacement, trade disruptions, and surges in food and fuel prices, the number of highly food insecure people in the country during this year’s lean season could be above last year’s figure.
Moreover, according to the latest IPC analysis, in the post-harvest period between October 2022 to February 2023, nearly eight million people were estimated to be acutely food insecure – a figure already 30 percent higher compared with the same period in the previous year.
“The current crisis has hit at a critical time for the millions of people reliant on food and agriculture,” said Rein Paulsen, Director of FAO's Office of Emergencies and Resilience. “We have a short but crucial window now to support local food production considering direct threats to other forms of life-saving assistance and difficulties in ensuring the rapid and safe passage of humanitarian goods across international borders. Boosting local food production and safeguarding livelihoods will not only reduce the food insecurity and human suffering in the country, but eventually lower the likely expanding humanitarian caseload in the coming months.”

Title: Protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law, says UN Special Adviser as she raises alarm on Sudan conflict
Content: 13 June 2023
Statement by Alice Wairimu Nderitu, United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, on the conflict in Sudan
New York – The United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu strongly condemns the ongoing fighting in Sudan between Sudan’s military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the blatant disregard for ceasefires which has caused, so far, the death of hundreds of people and injured thousands in Khartoum alone. The Special Adviser is particularly alarmed by the total disregard by the parties to the conflict of international humanitarian and human rights law.
“It is of the utmost importance that all parties to the conflict, including armed groups, lay down their weapons and cease their targeting of civilians immediately,” noted the Special Adviser.
The Special Adviser is also gravely concerned by the renewed fighting in Khartoum, particularly with the targeted missile attacks on the Al Azhari and Al Salama neighbourhoods on 11 June, in which 18 civilians were killed and many others injured – the third largest killing of civilians in a single day in one area. The dire humanitarian situation, including the lack of access for humanitarian assistance, which could have potentially catastrophic rippling effect across the country, is also to be taken extremely seriously.
In addition to human rights violations and abuses committed in Khartoum, the Special Adviser is alarmed by reports that the security vacuum and the protection gap in several states has been exploited by armed groups, including the Janjaweed and other rebel armed groups. These groups have allegedly been retaliating against ethnic communities on the basis of their ties to the main parties to the conflict, the Sudanese armed forces and the RSF. These attacks, if confirmed, could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.
In Darfur, hundreds have been killed and many more injured in reported clashes between members of different tribes, including looting and burning of houses as well as an attack on El Geneina’s hospital, in West Darfur. With thousands of civilians of all communities fleeing the conflict, reports also indicate that homes abandoned by Masalit communities have been occupied by Arab communities. The Special Adviser stressed that while tensions between ethnic communities, including ethnic Arabs and ethnic Masalit are not new in Darfur, they could not be used as a justification for reprisal.
“The violence in West Darfur is shocking. If it continues, it can develop into renewed campaigns of rape, murder, and ethnic cleansing amounting to atrocity crimes,” the Special Adviser warned.
Outbreaks of violence and tribal clashes have also been reported in other parts of the country, including in North and South Kordofan as well as in the Blue Nile states. The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide has already voiced her concern in a joint statement issued in November 2022 on hundreds of civilians killed in intercommunal clashes over land disputes among the Hausa, Funj and Berta ethnic communities of the Blue Nile state. In recent months, similar clashes have also been taking place in Kordofan states, involving the Misseriya and Nuba ethnic communities. The Special Adviser warns that if left unaddressed, this violence could engulf the entire country in a civil war, with high risks of atrocity crimes being committed.
In this context, the Special Adviser stresses that leaders of parties to the conflict, Sudan’s military and the RSF, have a responsibility to protect civilians as well as respect international human rights and humanitarian law. She also calls for an urgent and consolidated ceasefire, and for accountability for human rights violations and abuses.
Twenty years ago, millions of people in Darfur were displaced and thousands killed in violence perpetrated by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed militia. The International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur defined these crimes as serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law that might amount to crimes against humanity. Recalling her statement made in September 2022 supporting the ICC’s efforts to hold accountable perpetrators of atrocity crimes in Darfur, the Special Adviser stated:
“When perpetrators of past atrocities are not held accountable for their action, we are doomed to see history repeat itself. We need to unequivocally support accountability processes as we witness the resumption of violence across Sudan, including in Darfur, Blue Nile, and North and South Kordofan states. Whilst the International Criminal Court continues its work in Darfur, perpetrators should know that their actions will not go unpunished. The world is watching. We urge human rights violations and abuses to be immediately investigated, and perpetrators to be brought to justice”, the Special Adviser added.
Commending the efforts by local civilian committees and authorities, regional governments, mayors and sheikhs for cessation of hostilities and reconciliation, the Special Adviser called on all the people of Sudan, including political, community and religious leaders, and representatives of civil society to contribute to preventing atrocity crimes and the incitement to violence that could lead to such crimes, in line with the Plan of Action for Religious Leaders and Actors to Prevent and Counter Incitement to Violence and the UN Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech.
“We can and must do more, to save lives and prevent Sudan from collapsing and descending into horrific violence,” concluded the Special Adviser.

Title: Increasing risk of hunger set to spread in hotspot areas as the Sudan crisis spills over into subregion and el Niño looms - warns new UN report
Content: 29 May 2023
Burkina Faso, Haiti, Mali and the Sudan have been elevated to the highest alert level to join Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen
Joint FAO-WFP News Release
Rome – Acute food insecurity is set to potentially increase in magnitude and severity in 18 hunger “Hotspots” comprising a total of 22 countries, a new UN early warning report has found. The report spotlights the risk of a spill-over of the Sudan crisis - raising the risk of negative impacts in the neighbouring countries, shows that deepening economic shocks continue to drive low- and middle-income nations deeper into crisis, and warns that a likely El Niño climatic phenomenon is raising fears of climate extremes in vulnerable countries around the globe.
The report also found that many hotspots are facing growing hunger crises and highlights the worrying multiplier effect that simultaneous and overlapping shocks are having on acute food insecurity. Conflict, climate extremes, and economic shocks continue to drive more and more communities into crisis.
The report - ‘Hunger Hotspots – FAO-WFP early warnings on acute food insecurity’ - issued today by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) calls for urgent humanitarian action to save lives and livelihoods and prevent starvation and death in hotspots where acute hunger is at a high risk of worsening from June to November 2023.
“Business-as-usual pathways are no longer an option in today’s risk landscape if we want to achieve global food security for all, ensuring that no one is left behind.” said QU Dongyu, FAO Director-General.
“We need to provide immediate time-sensitive agricultural interventions to pull people from the brink of hunger, help them rebuild their lives, and provide long-term solutions to address the root causes of food insecurity. Investing in disaster risk reduction in the agriculture sector can unlock significant resilience dividends and must be scaled up,” he added.
“Not only are more people in more places around the world going hungry, but the severity of the hunger they face is worse than ever,” said Cindy McCain, WFP’s Executive Director.
“This report makes it clear: we must act now to save lives, help people adapt to a changing climate, and ultimately prevent famine. If we don’t, the results will be catastrophic,” McCain warned.
The report warns of a major risk of El Niño conditions, which meteorologists forecast to emerge by mid-2023 with an 82 percent probability. The expected shift in climate patterns will have significant implications for several hotspots, including below-average rains in the Dry Corridor of Central America, and raises the spectre of consecutive extreme climatic events hitting areas of the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.
The Sudan crisis spill-over
The spill-over from the crisis in the Sudan is driving massive population displacement and hunger among people forced from their homes in search of refuge and those hosting them – the report warns. More than one million people are expected to flee the country while an additional 2.5 million inside the Sudan set to face acute hunger in coming months.
The Sudan was already hosting over one million refugees – and if the conflict persists hundreds of thousands are likely to return to their counties of origin – many of which are already in the grips of underfunded and protracted refugee crises, compounded by social, political and economic stressors.
Supply routes for commercial and relief goods in and out of Port Sudan are being disrupted by insecurity, putting in jeopardy humanitarian assistance flows and regional relief efforts, the report notes. Disruptions to trade, cross-border commercial activities, and supply chains risk also driving up prices and inflation and depleting foreign exchange reserves in several countries – particularly in South Sudan – a country that relies on Port Sudan for both commercial and humanitarian imports, as well as vital oil exports.
The report warns that displacement into neighbouring countries and disruptions to trade risk also driving tensions among displaced people, those hosting them and new arrivals, as many hard-hit countries are already grappling with significant numbers of displaced people competing for limited livelihood and labour opportunities – particularly Chad and South Sudan - where fragile sociopolitical environments are at risk of deteriorating.
Mounting economic risks
Economic shocks and stressors continue to drive acute hunger in almost all hotspots, reflecting global trends that are carrying over from 2022 when economic risks were driving hunger in more countries and for more people than conflict was. These risks are largely linked to the socioeconomic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ripple effect from the war in Ukraine.
2023 is expected to bring a global economic slowdown amid monetary tightening in high-income countries – increasing the cost of credit, weakening local currencies, and further exacerbating the debt crisis in low- and middle-income economies. The International Monetary Fund projects global GDP growth at 2.8 percent in 2023 – the lowest level in ten years besides the COVID-19 induced plunge in 2020. Sub-Saharan Africa GDP will also grow 0.3 percent less than in 2022. Low- and middle- income countries are expected to be hit the hardest by the projected slow growth in their main export markets, alongside inflation rate hikes in high-income economies that will rely heavily on exports to advanced economies.
With global food prices likely to remain elevated compared with historical standards in coming months, macroeconomic pressures in low- and middle-income countries are unlikely to ease. This means that the subsequent drop in purchasing power will negatively affect families’ access to food in coming months in many hotspots.
Key findings
According to the report, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen remain at the highest alert level. Haiti, the Sahel (Burkina Faso and Mali) and the Sudan have been elevated to the highest concern levels; this is due to severe movement restrictions to people and goods in Burkina Faso, Haiti and Mali, and the recent outbreak of conflict in the Sudan. All hotspots at the highest level have communities facing or projected to face starvation, or are at risk of sliding towards catastrophic conditions, given they have already emergency levels of food insecurity and are facing severe aggravating factors. These hotspots require the most urgent attention, the report warns.
The Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Pakistan and Syria are hotspots with very high concern, and the alert is also extended to Myanmar in this edition. All these hotspots have a large number of people facing critical acute food insecurity, coupled with worsening drivers that are expected to further intensify life‑threatening conditions in the coming months. Lebanon has been added to the list of hotspots, joining Malawi and Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) that remain hotspots.
Scaling up anticipatory action and humanitarian action to prevent disasters
To avert a further deterioration of acute hunger and malnutrition, the report provides concrete country-specific recommendations on priorities for immediate emergency response to save lives, prevent famine and protect livelihoods, as well as anticipatory action. Humanitarian action will be critical in preventing starvation and death – particularly in the highest alert hotspots, but the report notes how humanitarian access is constrained by insecurity, bureaucratic barriers, and movement restrictions – posing a major challenge to humanitarian responders around the globe. The report also stresses the importance of strengthening anticipatory action in humanitarian and development assistance – ensuring predictable hazards do not become full-blown humanitarian disasters.
Note to editors
The Hunger Hotspots report identifies areas where acute food insecurity could increase during the outlook period. The hotspots are determined through forward-looking analysis and selected through a consensus-based process involving WFP and FAO field and technical teams, alongside analysts specialized in conflict, economic risks and natural hazards. The report is part of a series of analytical products produced under the Global Network Against Food Crises, to enhance and coordinate the generation and sharing of evidence-based information and analysis for preventing and addressing food crises.
This series includes the recently published 2023 Global Report on Food Crises, which retroactively looks at the levels of acute food insecurity in 2022.

Title: Cereal production improves while food insecurity persists in the Sudan – new report finds
Content: 27 March 2023
Although overall cereal production at national level is impressively better than the previous season, food insecurity at the household level remains a serious challenge
A recently released special report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 2022/23 Crops and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) has revealed significant improvements in cereal production in the Sudan. The mission was conducted at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests and in close collaboration with key partners, including the World Food Programme, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, and the United States Agency for International Development.
As the report indicates, most agricultural inputs, including seed, fertilizer, herbicides, fuel, and labour, were available in 2022 – but at a very high cost compared to the previous season. As a result, most farmers had to utilize the seeds they had saved from the previous year’s harvest due to high market prices.
“Although overall cereal production at national level is impressively better than the previous season, food insecurity at the household level remains a serious challenge,” said Adam Yao, FAO Representative a.i. in the Sudan. “Communities are facing differing scales of vulnerabilities driven by soaring prices of staple crops, and the combined effects of economic downturn, high inflation, climate-induced hazards and conflict.”
According to the report, the 2022 national cereal production, which includes sorghum, millet, and wheat crops (harvested in March 2023), is estimated at about 7.4 million tonnes – 45 percent above that obtained in 2021. Sorghum production alone is approximately 5.2 million tonnes, a 50 percent increase compared to the previous year. Millet output is estimated at 1.7 million tonnes, an 86 percent increase compared to 2021. However, the production of wheat to be harvested in March 2023 is forecasted at about 476 000 tonnes – a 30 percent decrease compared to 2021 due to a reduction in planted area in favor of legumes and spices.
This significant increase in total cereal production can be attributed to favorable weather conditions, in particular a good performance of the rainy season, supported by over 5 000 tonnes of quality seeds of improved varieties supplied by FAO to strengthen vulnerable households ‘own food production. With 95 percent of cultivated land under rain-fed agriculture, rainfall is an important driver of crop production.
Using the population projection of 47.6 million people for mid-2023[1], the cereal import requirements for the 2023 marketing year (January/December) are forecasted at 3.6 million tonnes, almost entirely of wheat, which will require an importation of 3.5 million tonnes to cover domestic consumption. This will have a major impact on the food security of millions of Sudanese people, as international prices of wheat continue to increase and the country’s national currency weakens.
By contrast, for sorghum and millet, surpluses of 484 000 tonnes and 679 000 tonnes are forecasted respectively.
“It is essential to continue enhancing domestic cereal production to strengthen the food security and resilience of the most vulnerable people in the Sudan”, emphasised Mr Yao.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Our goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide. We believe that everyone can play a part in ending hunger.

Title: Norway, FAO support Sudanese smallholders’ farmers and agro-pastoralists value chain in the face of climate change
Content: 09 March 2023
The project supported by the Embassy of Norway will develop an inclusive partnership with all key stakeholders to ensure that smallholder farmers, agro-pastoralists, and pastoralists supported by the project are more resilient, more productive, more efficient more profitable, and food-secured.
Khartoum - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) together with the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Sudan and the Ministry of Agriculture conducted a three-day inception workshop of the project: ‘’ FAO Sudan smallholders and agro-pastoralists value chain support in the face of climate change’’ from 6 to 8 March.
The purpose of the workshop which gathered more than 150 participants was to provide a platform to key stakeholders – Smallholder farmers and pastoralists’ representatives, Federal and decentralized State authorities, the Norwegian Embassy, UN agencies, SMEs, Universities and Academia, NGOs, Civil Society Organizations, and others to review the project framework and develop recommendations to streamline the project design and activities to be implemented in the states of Sennar, White Nile, and Gedaref.
The Ambassador of Norway to Sudan in his opening remarks emphasized on the importance of supporting the agriculture sector and vulnerable smallholders and pastoralists to overcome their challenges to be self-reliant and produce enough food to strengthen their food and nutrition security to directly contribute to the achievement of key Sustainable Development Goals including the SDGs: 2, 1,5,8,12,13,16 and 17, and indirectly to other SDGs. The project is also in line with the national plan and strategy of the government of Sudan.
Agriculture production systems and food systems in Sudan must undergo a significant transformation in order to achieve sustainability, increase food security, and respond to climate change. “In this regards the project supported by the Embassy of Norway will develop an inclusive partnership with all key stakeholders to ensure that smallholder farmers, agro-pastoralists, and pastoralists supported by the project are more resilient, more productive, more efficient more profitable, and food-secured using watershed ecosystem management and climate-smart agriculture approaches”, said Adam Yao, FAO Representative a.i in Sudan.

Title: Joint Press Release: UN-Habitat Sudan Receives USD 605,222 from Japan to support Peaceful IDP returns to North Darfur, Sudan
Content: 23 February 2023
Japan has made a contribution of USD 605,222 to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in Sudan’s project “Emergency Support to IDP Returns in El Fasher Locality, North Darfur State” for a period of one year running from January 2023 to January 2024. The project will benefit some 36,000 returned Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) and host communities in El Fasher Locality, North Darfur State.
El Fasher is one of the localities that host a largest number of IDPs who have been displaced for two decades. Due to the recent political and economic situations of the country, deteriorated security situations, and protracted displacement, the IDPs face precarious living conditions characterized by lack of basic services, lack of security of land tenure, and lack of livelihood options. Deprivation in these basic rights, in turn, worsens the vulnerability of IDPs towards economic crisis and food security.
Through the support of Japan, the project aims to support sustainable IDP returns and ensure human security of both the returned IDPs and host communities through the improvement in basic services and public facilities, securing land rights of returned IDPs and host community members, and ensuring the commitment of relevant actors towards guiding principle for sustainable, voluntary, dignified and safe return of IDP’s. The project also aims to enhance self-reliance of the returned IDPs and host communities, by training youth and women on self-help construction using the environmentally sensitive and affordable Stabilized Soil Blocks (SSB).
His Excellency Mr. Takashi Hattori, Ambassador of Japan to the Republic of the Sudan expressed that “It is our honor to continue our work with UN-Habitat Sudan through our project ‘Emergency Support to IDP Returns in El Fasher Locality, North Darfur State’. The Government of Japan has long been a strong advocate of and contributor to improving human security globally. I sincerely hope that this project would contribute to ensuring the human security of both the returned IDPs and host community members, which perfectly aligns with our vision in ensuring sustainable and durable peace.”
Mr. Masayuki Yokota, Head of UN-Habitat Country Programme highlighted the critical challenges in Darfur, where the vulnerability of IDPs are heightened due to the recent political, economic and security situations, requiring urgent attention and practical solutions to build their resilience and to ensure human security. Particularly, a large number of IDPs living in informal settlements around major cities and towns lead to unplanned, rapid urbanization in urban peripheries without adequate basic services and infrastructure, which negatively affect the host communities. Mr. Yokota expressed his gratitude to the Government of Japan for their support to the project that addresses the urgent need to improve the human security situations of IDPs and host communities, and at the same time contributes to the long-germ resilience of returned IDPs and host communities through improved access to livelihood for local youth and women, basic services and land rights.
Japan also provided UN-Habitat Sudan with support for sustainable IDP returns and peaceful coexistence of IDPs and host communities in Eid Elfursan and Alsalam Localities, South Darfur State, and Tawilla Locality, North Darfur State in recent years.

Title: UN rights expert Radhouane Nouicer’s statement at end of first official visit
Content: 02 February 2023
Without political stability, the environment will not be conducive to improvement of the human rights situation
Sudan: UN rights expert Radhouane Nouicer’s statement at end of first official visit
Khartoum, 2 February 2023
Good afternoon. Thank you all for coming.
As you may be aware, I was appointed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights as his Designated Expert on the human rights situation in Sudan in December, succeeding Adama Dieng. During this visit to Sudan, the first in my official capacity, I have met with the authorities, civil society, and victims of human rights violations in Khartoum and in West Darfur. I have also held meetings with members of the diplomatic community and the UN country team.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the authorities in Sudan for their cooperation with my mandate, their support for my visit, and for the frank and constructive discussions we have had on human rights issues.  I welcome the commitments made in my meetings with them to address the concerns I raised.
Four years ago, when Sudanese women, men and youth took to the streets demanding respect for their rights, full of hope for a safer and more just future, the world was watching in support. Sudan today stands at a critical crossroads. A new phase of the transition is urgently needed to continue the process towards democracy that was interrupted by the October 2021 military takeover and meet the population’s demands for freedom, peace, and justice.
I welcome the important human rights commitments in the Framework Agreement that was signed between civilian political forces and the military in December last year and hope that roadmaps will be soon established to address all five outstanding issues, with broad participation of concerned parties in an inclusive dialogue, so that a final agreement can be signed and a civilian government appointed. Resumption of legal and institutional reform, with the participation of civil society, must be a priority for a new government. Human rights and accountability must be central to the next government’s program.
That Sudan faces huge challenges was brought into clearer focus to me in my various meetings. In El Geneina, I met people who had been repeatedly displaced as a result of armed attacks against their communities, for which, to my understanding, no one has been held accountable. Some have been displaced for nearly 20 years but still hold hope that they will one day be able to return safely to their homes and lands. For that, they need security, and a political commitment to resolve the underlying causes of conflict. Implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement and the National Action Plan for the Protection of Civilians can help to resolve some of these issues. Failure to take action to protect the population will lead to further conflict and an increase in the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance.
The message of the victims and civil society representatives I have met is clear and I fully endorse it: all those responsible for human rights violations and abuses committed during Sudan’s conflicts must be held to account, in accordance with due process and without unjustified delays. This is the message I delivered to the authorities. Accountability and transitional justice require a process and credible mechanisms that address past crimes, their root causes, and prevent recurrence.
From my meetings with a large number of civil society representatives, including women and young people, I got a clear sense of a lack of confidence in the way things are going - an uncertainty about the future. Many reported increased restrictions on their activities, including increased bureaucracy, denial of NGO registration and undue scrutiny of their funding. They felt that the space that had opened for civil society during the transition is being closed again. A robust and diverse civil society is fundamental to democracy, and serious steps towards building trust between the population and state institutions is key for the success of any political process. Without political stability, the environment will not be conducive to improvement of the human rights situation.
In my meetings with the authorities, I raised several interlinked issues and made to them the following recommendations:
We are at a critical moment in Sudan’s history. For Sudan’s democratic transition to succeed, there must be solidarity among all sectors of this culturally rich and diverse society. The time has come for Sudanese leaders from all parties, military and civilian, whatever their political positions, to set aside their personal interests and work for the common good of the Sudanese people.
I would like to thank all those national and international actors working to help Sudan along the path of democracy, development and prosperity.

Title: Statement of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) on the killing of an aid worker in Blue Nile region
Content: 29 January 2023
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) strongly condemns the killing of an aid worker in Blue Nile region.
“I am deeply saddened by the news of the killing of a peacebuilding adviser who has been working for the United Nations. I express my deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues,” said Volker Perthes.
On 27 January 2023, a contractor for Addition Organization for Disaster and Development (ADD), a local NGO and UN partner, was killed and an ADD staff member was injured after their vehicle came under fire at a checkpoint.
At the time of the killing, they were on their way to carry out peacebuilding activities in Giessan as part of a UN project to support post-conflict recovery, conflict resolution and conflict prevention in Blue Nile State. “I am profoundly distressed by the loss of life of a peacebuilding adviser, who, together with the UN, was committed to building bridges between communities. Aid workers must be respected and protected,” added Mr. Perthes.
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) calls on the Sudanese authorities to take swift action to identify the perpetrators of this attack and bring them to justice. He reaffirms that such acts will not diminish the resolve of the United Nations to continue supporting the people and the Government of Sudan in their quest for peace and stability.

Title: Norway, FAO sign USD15 million agreement to support Sudanese smallholders’ farmers and agro-pastoralists value chain in the face of climate change
Content: 15 December 2022
Addressing the root causes of agriculture under performance for a sustainable agro-food systems transformation
On Thursday, 8 December 2022, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Sudan signed a four-year project agreement: ‘’FAO Sudan smallholders and agro-pastoralists value chain support in the face of climate change’’ worth of USD15 million to support 20 000 Sudanese smallholders’ farmers and agro-pastoralists value chain in the face of climate change.
Sudan is among the ten Sahelian countries in Africa with a tropical semi-arid climate. The agricultural sector contributes about 35 to 40% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs over 80% of the population, of which majority are smallholder farmers, agro-pastoralist, and pastoralist. The country’s agricultural livelihoods are heavily dependent on soil, water, and vegetation resources, making food and nutrition security highly sensitive and vulnerable to weather extremes and consequences of climate change and variability.
Other challenges facing Sudanese agriculture sector are the very low use of high-quality seeds and improved animal breeds among the rural farmers and pastoralists, thus affecting the overall agricultural productivity as well as access to markets and improved value chains.
With little resilience to climatic changes, economic and social shocks, smallholder farmers, and pastoralist have become extremely vulnerable to food and nutritional insecurity. The integrity of Sudan’s natural ecosystem and provision of ecosystem services are crucial to sustainable and resilient development in the face of changing climate. To address the challenges, the project will apply sustainable integrated watershed ecosystem management approaches as a unique opportunity to integrate climate change adaptation/ resilience and mitigation strategies to make agriculture crops, livestock, and fishery more productive for the benefit of 20000 smallholders’ farmers, pastoralists, youth, and women groups in White Nile, Gedaref and Sennar states.
The project is organized around four mutually interdependent results or intervention areas, to address (1) Watershed ecosystem adaptive and mitigation capacities enhanced, (2) Climate-resilient agriculture value chain development of key agriculture commodities, access to market and linkages with the private sector are strengthened, (3) Better access to improved and high quality seeds and enhanced scope to community seed production and (4) Knowledge and institutional capacities of federal government and decentralized state levels to support smallholder farmers and pastoralists to respond to climate change challenges.
The project duration is 4 years from December 2022 to November 2026, starting with a six-month Inception Phase wherein FAO and in consultation with key stakeholders, will further elaborate the project implementation strategy in all key areas of results, activities, geographical locations, selection of beneficiaries and other implementation arrangements.
‘’This is a complex and multi-dimensional project, which benefits from USD15 million generous funding from the Embassy of Norway in Sudan to address the root causes of agriculture under performance for a sustainable agro-food systems transformation contributing to the achievement of the SDG 2: “Zero Hunger Goal of leave no one behand in Sudan’’, says Babagana Ahmadu, FAO Representative in Sudan.

Title: Statement by the Huamanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on the launch of the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan
Content: 14 December 2022
In 2023, a total of 15.8 million people are estimated to need humanitarian assistance
Khartoum - The humanitarian community in Sudan launches the 2023 Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) to address the most immediate and critical needs of 12.5 million of the most vulnerable people in Sudan seeking generous contributions from donors at US$1.7 billion.
 
“The 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan we launched today is the result of months-long consultations and efforts to find the best possible way to meet the food, water and sanitation, health, protection, education and other needs of the 12.5 million most vulnerable people in Sudan,” the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Mrs. Khardiata Lo Ndiaye said.
  
In 2023, a total of 15.8 million people – almost one third of the country’s population – are estimated to need humanitarian assistance. The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2023 is the highest in a decade.
 
These needs are driven by conflict, increasing protection of civilians risks, the economic deterioration, natural hazards and persistent disease outbreaks.
 
In addition, there have been unprecedented spikes in acute food insecurity due to dry spells and erratic rains, and high inflation for food and other commodities.
 
“I would like to thank all our government counterparts, donors and partners for their continued support and engagement with humanitarian action in Sudan. I would like to urge our generous donors to provide early and expedient funding for the HRP 2023 to allow us to sustain humanitarian operations and provide timely response to various crises,” the Humanitarian Coordinator said.
 
In 2022, humanitarian organizations reached 9.1 million of the most vulnerable people across Sudan with some form of humanitarian assistance.

Title: DSRSG/RC/HC’s message to launch the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence
Content: 25 November 2022
These 16 Days of Activism remind us that gender-based violence remains a widespread and appalling affront to human rights.
Nearly 1 in 3 women are affected in their lifetime, regardless of age, culture, class, or economic status.
Survivors are left with permanent scars, risking physical injuries, psychological trauma, forced pregnancies, unsafe abortions, community stigmatization, and death.
Times of crisis magnify existing gender inequalities and escalate the risk of gender-based violence. These crises include violent conflict, climate change, natural disasters, and political and economic instability, all of which we are grappling with here in Sudan.
In Sudan, women working in informal sectors and in camp settings, domestic workers, and people with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence.
Too often survivors are blamed for being abused and stigmatized in their communities.
This must stop. Survivors of violence must be heard and believed, and perpetrators must be held accountable for their actions.
Every woman and girl has the right to live a life free of violence and full of dignity. It is a fundamental human right.
Specific measures to ensure the protection of women and girls are urgently needed, including the availability and accessibility of quality, multi-sectoral services, including health care, justice, safety, protection and social services for survivors of gender-based violence.
This year’s theme: “UNITE: Activism to End Violence Against Women and Girls” encourages us to unite with activists around the world who are pushing forward change and supporting survivors of violence.
Each of us can take action to end violence against women and girls. Together, we must uphold our commitments end gender-based violence now.

Title: Sudan: Justice for repression against anti-coup protesters key to breaking cycle of violence and political turmoil, say UN experts
Content: 25 October 2022
UN human rights experts demanded effective accountability for the year-long brutal crackdown on peaceful protests against the October 2021 military coup in Sudan.
GENEVA (25 October 2022) – UN human rights experts* today demanded effective accountability for the year-long brutal crackdown on peaceful protests against the October 2021 military coup in Sudan. To break the country’s cycle of turmoil, they also called for an independent accountability and transitional justice mechanism with a mandate to address human rights violations committed during protests, including the gendered nature of the violence, and provide suitable reparations.
“Over the past year, we have received continued reports of protestors being killed, forcibly disappeared, injured, tortured and subjected to sexual and gender-based violence. Prosecuting perpetrators, including high-level commanders responsible for these violations is critical to ensuring Sudan’s sustainable transition to a credible democratic civilian government,” the experts said.
The experts called for an “effective and adequately resourced independent accountability mechanism which is victim-centred” and that would address the reported grave violations in relation to the clampdown on peaceful protests since the military coup.
They further urged serious measures to conclude investigations by the previously set-up national commission of inquiry, and to bring justice for the victims of the unresolved serious crimes committed during the 2019 protests.
“If these atrocities are not addressed, if victims are once again denied justice and reparations, and if the voices of protesters are not heard, Sudan’s cycle of political turmoil and brutal repression will continue, and the humanitarian crisis will deepen,” they said.
UN experts have repeatedly raised the alarm about reports of unlawful and excessive use of force and arrests as the military authorities have clamped down on peaceful protests since the coup. Joint security forces were reportedly regularly using lethal force, either directly or by indiscriminately firing at protesters. The unlawful tactics had left at least 117 protesters killed and an estimated 7,700 protesters, including thousands of children, seriously injured, based on documented cases by Sudanese health practitioners. The majority of the injuries were caused by the use of firearms or tear gas canisters.
“We are very concerned that, as a result, some of the injured protesters sustained permanent or long-lasting paralysis, limb amputations, loss of eyesight and eye removals. There are alarming indications that many of those killed and injured in the context of the protests were victims of targeted attacks,” the experts said.
They raised serious concerns that hundreds were arrested, including women and children, for exercising their right to peaceful assembly, and without due process.
“Many of the detained have reportedly been subjected to torture and ill-treatment in custody, while some were forcibly disappeared or secretly detained. These cases must be thoroughly and independently investigated and the authorities must immediately disclose the fate and whereabouts of the missing protesters,” the experts said.
There are also reports of women having been subjected to sexual and gender-based violence, including abuse and gang rape, at sites within the proximity of protests or while in detention, the experts said.
These violations were committed under protracted emergency measures, giving extended powers and immunity from prosecution to the security forces.
“The repeated use of repressive tactics against peaceful protesters strongly underscores the need for accountability, security sector and justice reform, including reparations, to ensure that people can exercise their fundamental rights and effectively participate in the country’s democratic transition,” the experts said.
“The lack of accountability for alleged crimes has a chilling effect on the people’s right to freedom of peaceful assembly and participation in public affairs.”
The Sudanese authorities have an obligation to end impunity and provide remedy to victims and, as relevant, to their families, the experts said, urging the international community to ensure that accountability was central to ongoing political talks and the transition process in the country. The experts further called on the international community to ensure civil society and victims are part of the political talks.
They urged authorities to show restraint and refrain from the use of excessive force in response to any ongoing anti-coup protests. The military authorities must refrain from obstructing internet and telecommunications prior, during or after protests.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on relocation of IDPs in White Nile State
Content: 12 October 2022
I call on the State authorities to continue to provide access to essential services, shelter, healthcare, education, livelihoods, etc., within local communities, ensuring freedom of movement and protection to the relocated IDPs.
Khartoum: Following the events in July 2022, I had – at the time – expressed deep concern over the dozens of civilians killed and thousands of women and children who fled intercommunal violence in Ar Rusayris, Damazine, and other parts of Blue Nile State. High appreciation to the State Government of White Nile and, most importantly, the communities in Kosti and Rabak. They have provided much-needed shelter and support for these displaced individuals, over 19,000 of whom settled in White Nile.
Most of these internally displaced persons (IDPs) were able to be hosted within communities in White Nile. However, I remain deeply concerned regarding how this relocation has taken place.
It is the country’s obligation to prevent displacement, protect and assist the displaced people and identify durable solutions for them. I call on the State authorities to continue to provide access to essential services, shelter, healthcare, education, livelihoods, etc., within local communities, ensuring freedom of movement and protection to the relocated IDPs.
While I commend the attempts by the State authorities to secure a relocation site in Khor Ajwal, it is essential that relocation to such sites is voluntary and that humanitarian partners can assess the suitability and safety of such sites in advance.
The State authorities' decision to temporarily pause the eviction of IDPs on 5 October 2022 to allow humanitarian actors to establish some basic level of services is a positive signal. I call on the State authorities to continue to enable unrestricted humanitarian actors to allow all humanitarian actors, including UN agencies, and international and national NGOs, to deliver life-saving assistance to this population in need. I urge humanitarian actors to continue to engage constructively and appreciate the additional assistance being provided to address the food and shelter gaps.
The assessment and preparation of sites are essential aspects of the humanitarian response to displaced populations. In the absence of a preliminary site assessment before people were evicted from gathering sites in the four schools in Kosti and Rabak, it appears that the site is close to reaching its maximum capacity. There is a significant risk of overcrowding, and many essential services (e.g., water, sanitation, etc.) are yet to be installed at the site.
I urge the State authorities to treat the displaced individuals according to humanitarian norms, standards, and principles. I urge all stakeholders to continue to address the root causes of such conflicts and create conditions that would allow this population to voluntarily return to their homes with dignity and assured of their long-term safety. The humanitarian community stands ready to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected and to work with the authorities toward sustainable solutions for all displaced people in Sudan.

Title: WFP and UNICEF launch new BMZ-KFW-funded joint programme to strengthen resilience and social cohesion in Darfur
Content: 07 September 2022
JOINT PRESS RELEASE
KHARTOUM - UNICEF and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) launched a new joint programme today to strengthen resilience and social cohesion among communities in Darfur.
The four-year joint programme is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) through the KfW German Development Bank.
This is a unique programme that aims to provide long-term solutions by tackling underlying barriers to peace, stability and development to nearly 300,000 vulnerable Sudanese across South, Central and North Darfur, who have been adversely affected by conflict, climate change, natural disasters, and economic downturns.
The first of its kind at its scale in Sudan, the programme takes a holistic and inclusive approach that will enable communities to better withstand multiple shocks and plant the seeds for peaceful coexistence among diverse populations.
“The new joint programme underlines the German Government’s commitment to supporting households and communities affected by multiple crises. With this programme, we seek to strengthen their resilience over the medium and long term. UNICEF and WFP working together will ensure that people benefit from a comprehensive, integrated package of essential services. By involving communities in the design of activities we also aim to foster social cohesion,” said Hanspeter Schwaer, Senior Policy Advisor from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
“While the German Government supports direct assistance to the communities, cooperation with the Government of Sudan remains paused. Germany underlines that to re-establish cooperation, an inclusive political settlement and the restoration of a credible transition remain urgent," he concluded.
The programme will be implemented in North Darfur (El Fasher, Tawilla), South Darfur (Kass, Bileil) and Central Darfur (Zalingei, Mukjar) involving diverse sectors of the community including internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and host communities.
Communities in the Darfur region continue to experience setbacks due to natural disasters such as floods and prolonged dry spells, in addition to violent conflict. These shocks have worsened the food security of families and limited access to basic services. Competition over resources and services shared by host communities, returnees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) exacerbates these challenges.
“This programme will be a game-changer for communities in Darfur. It will help ensure vulnerable families don’t slip further into hunger and can actively participate in overcoming underlying challenges to peacebuilding and stability in their communities,” said Mr Eddie Rowe, WFP Sudan Representative and Country Director.
“The ripple effects of creating livelihood opportunities and social safety net systems will persist long after this programme concludes. Thanks to the multi-year funding from the German Government for a long-term programme, we are one step closer to recovery and sustainable development in Sudan,” he concluded.
The programme strives to create sustainable food systems, increase communities’ access to integrated basic social services, strengthen systems at the local level to improve service delivery, and enhance community-based networks to reconcile local conflicts and build trust through inclusive social dialogue.
“Children continue to bear the brunt of conflict and emergencies. We thank the German Government for the generous support that will complement our humanitarian, development and peace nexus programming delivered in the Darfur region, as we strive to create safe and enabling environment for children to survive and thrive,” said Mandeep O’Brien, UNICEF’s Representative to Sudan.
“Increasing access for vulnerable children, young people and their community members to quality health, nutrition, education, protection and water, sanitation and hygiene services will certainly contribute to fostering healthier, more productive, and resilient communities for the future” she continued.
At this critical time in Sudan’s history, multi-year funding for long-term programs that empower and entrust ownership to local communities is critical to the transition from short-term humanitarian assistance toward lasting solutions and sustainable development. WPF and UNICEF will continue to advocate for similar investments in the future that will bridge the gap between humanitarian and development assistance and peacebuilding.

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on floods response
Content: 22 August 2022
Humanitarian organizations have dispatched relief supplies for about 40,000 people who have been affected by heavy rains and floods
Khartoum: The United Nations and humanitarian partners have dispatched relief supplies for over 40,000 flood-affected people and thousands more will receive humanitarian assistance in the coming days and weeks, the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan a.i. Eddie Rowe said.
“Humanitarian organizations have dispatched relief supplies for about 40,000 people who have been affected by heavy rains and floods. At least 9,700 flood-affected people in the larger Kordofan area, East Darfur, Central Darfur, and South Darfur states have already received shelter supplies,” the Humanitarian Coordinator a.i. said. “We will scale up the assistance as soon as some of the areas that have been cut off are accessible again and we can deliver the supplies for affected states, including Aj Jazirah and others.”
Health sector partners have provided medicines and medical supplies for about 10,000 patients with water and vector-borne diseases that usually surge with the onset of the rainy season and floods.
More than 19,000 affected people have received chlorine for water treatment, as well as sanitation and hygiene supplies in South Darfur and White Nile states. Water, sanitation and hygiene sector (WASH) partners are rehabilitating water pumps, rehabilitation water yards, and providing water treatment chemicals and WASH non-food items (NFIs) for flood-affected families in West Darfur, White Nile, South Darfur, Gedaref, and East Darfur.
As of 22 August, the estimated number of flood-affected people is more than 146,200, according to the Government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), humanitarian organizations on the ground, and local authorities. Torrential rains and floods destroyed at least 9,600 houses and damaged another 22,000 in 14 states. The government authorities reported that 79 people died and 30 people were injured since the beginning of the rainy season.
The most affected states are Central Darfur (41,670 people), South Darfur (28,730), River Nile (15,720), West Darfur (15,500), White Nile (13,920), West Kordofan (5,860), South Kordofan (5,770), and others.
In addition, the floods have reportedly affected at least 238 health facilities, 1,560 water sources and over 1,500 latrines were damaged or washed away. People have lost over 330 head of livestock and over 5,200 feddans (18.9 km2) of agricultural land were affected by floods.
In 2022, more than 460,000 people could be affected by the floods, according to the 2022 Sudan Emergency Response Plan (ERP). In 2021, a year of depressed rains, about 314,500 people were affected across Sudan, while between 2017 and 2021 floods on average affected 388,600 people annually.
As of 22 August, donors provided about $607.8 million for the 2022 Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which is about 31 percent of the required amount.
“We are grateful to the donors for their support to alleviate the suffering and provide life-saving assistance to millions of people in need in Sudan. We are calling upon our generous donors to expedite HRP 2022 funding as the needs are growing and we still have time to respond,” the Humanitarian Coordinator a.i. said.
Background on HRP:
During January-June 2022, despite low funding and other challenges, HRP partners reached 7.1 million people in need in Sudan with some form of humanitarian assistance. About 5.2 million people received food and livelihood assistance, close to 2 million people were provided with access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services, almost 1.9 million people were reached with mine action activities, and about 0.9 million people were covered with healthcare services.
Moreover, close to 850,000 children were provided with nutrition services and nutritional supplements, 775,000 vulnerable people were reached with protection activities and 550,000 refugees received various forms of assistance, protection and support.

Title: Statement by Mr. Eddie Rowe, Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan a.i. on World Humanitarian Day 2022
Content: 21 August 2022
“It Takes a village” "One hand doesn’t clap alone”
Khartoum - There are many ways to describe how it takes not only one person, but a community of people to come together to support people in need. This year’s World Humanitarian Day highlights this fact by commemorating and celebrating humanitarian aid workers across the world.

Humanitarian needs are at an all-time high in Sudan: 14.3 million people need assistance in 2022. These needs are driven by conflict, a political and economic crisis, increased insecurity, protracted internal displacement, food insecurity, dry spells, floods, and disease outbreaks. Support is needed now more than ever, and the role of aid workers is pivotal.

During my visits across Sudan, I have met many hard-working humanitarians, most of them Sudanese, working to support their fellow Sudanese. In an emergency, the first people to respond are always crisis-affected people themselves. They are joined by local volunteers, emergency services, local and national authorities, NGOs, UN agencies, and the Red Cross and Red Crescent, among many others. I have been impressed by their determination to provide relief for those who are in need. There is nothing more heartwarming than seeing people supporting each other - they are an inspiration for us all and role models for humanity.

As we mark this year’s World Humanitarian Day, we commemorate those we have lost. In 2021 in Sudan, 19 aid workers were attacked while responding to humanitarian crises — two of them were killed. So far this year, eight aid workers have been attacked, and none of them were killed.

I also join the Secretary-General in saluting humanitarians' dedication and courage. They represent the best of humanity indeed.

Title: More than Two Million Food Insecure Sudanese to Benefit from a New Emergency Safety Net Project Supported by Development Partners through the World Bank
Content: 21 July 2022
PRESS RELEASE
The pause of disbursements by the World Bank in all of its operations to Government of Sudan as of October 25, 2021 remains in effect. At the same time, the international community is concerned about the growing food insecurity and humanitarian risks in the country and has been working together with the World Bank to find a way to meet the urgent needs of the Sudanese people.
At the request of the international community, today the World Bank signed an agreement with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to provide $100 million in financing directly to WFP for a new Sudan Emergency Safety Nets Project. The project responds to the deep food insecurity in Sudan caused by a poor harvest and rising international food prices. Funded through the support of donors to the Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Trust Fund (STARS), the project aims to provide cash transfers and food to more than two million food insecure beneficiaries in 11 states in Sudan based on a vulnerability assessment carried out by WFP. This support was made possible thanks to contributions from the European Union, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Netherlands, Norway, Canada, Italy, Finland, Spain, Ireland, and the State and Peacebuilding Fund.
“While funding under agreements signed with the Government of Sudan remains paused, development partners are pleased to provide direct support to the Sudanese people during this critical time. This is in line with our Fragility, Conflict, and Violence Strategy which focuses on protecting the human capital of the most vulnerable groups in times of crisis,” said Ousmane Dione, World Bank Country Director for Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Sudan. “Any decision to resume financing to the government will be made following an assessment of the situation. The World Bank continues to closely monitor the situation and there is no specific deadline for such decision.”
The funds will be channeled solely through the WFP to scale up the food security response and provide direct support to the most vulnerable people of Sudan. Priority will be given to women, children, elders, and those with disabilities. Support will be provided primarily through cash transfers. Where possible, mobile payments will be made to beneficiaries. Specific measures will be taken to reach remote populations without access to internet. Where beneficiaries cannot buy sufficient food in local markets, they will receive direct food assistance instead of cash.
ABOUT STARS
The Sudan Transition and Recovery Support Trust Fund (STARS) is an umbrella coordination platform for World Bank engagement in Sudan, supporting Sudan’s economic and peacebuilding transition. STARS operates thanks to the generous financial contributions from the European Union, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Netherlands, Norway, Canada, Italy, Finland, Spain, Ireland, and the State and Peacebuilding Fund.

Title: Daily press briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General
Content: 20 July 2022
In Sudan, our Humanitarian Coordinator, Khardiata Lo Ndiaye, said she is deeply concerned following the killings of dozens of civilians and the displacement of thousands of women and girls in a wave of recent inter-communal violence in Blue Nile state. She calls on all parties to stop the violence and to seek mutually acceptable solutions.
Humanitarian workers have reached more than 560,000 people with assistance between January and March of this year in Blue Nile. Aid organizations are providing health and medical supplies, as well as food, and are being asked to expand the capacity of a field hospital to treat the injured.
These latest clashes come at a time when humanitarian needs in Sudan are already at an all-time high. More than 14 million people currently require some form of life-saving aid. The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, which calls for $1.9 billion, is only 20 per cent funded.

Title: STATEMENT BY THE HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR IN SUDAN ON VIOLENCE IN BLUE NILE STATE
Content: 19 July 2022
Humanitarian organizations are dispatching health and medical supplies enough for 30,000 people, including three emergency health kits (medicines and supplies for treatment), trauma kits and supplies for at least 450 trauma cases.
Khartoum, 19 July 2022: The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Khardiata Lo Ndiaye has expressed deep concern over dozens of civilians killed and thousands of women and children displaced after a wave of inter-communal violence in parts of Blue Nile State over the past few days. Humanitarian organizations are providing the affected people with initial assistance.
 
“We are deeply concerned, lives have been lost, thousands of people had to flee and seek safety and shelter, and lives of many others have been disrupted,” the Humanitarian Coordinator said. “I am calling on all parties to stop the violence, talk to each other and seek mutually acceptable solutions.”
 
As of 19 July, about 14,000 people have been displaced from Ar Rusayris locality in Blue Nile State following a wave of inter-communal violence that started in Ganis town and other parts of Ar Rusayris on 15 July, according to the government authorities. There are reports of an additional 1,000 people displaced in Ar Rusayris, and 500 people outside Ed Damazine town. The total number of displaced is likely to increase, as information from other parts of the state and neighboring states comes in. The Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) has so far registered 97 total deaths related to the violence.
 
“We are already providing assistance and support to thousands of vulnerable people in parts of Blue Nile State and stand ready to support the people affected by this wave of violence,” the Humanitarian Coordinator said.
 
Humanitarian organizations are dispatching health and medical supplies enough for 30,000 people, including three emergency health kits (medicines and supplies for treatment), trauma kits and supplies for at least 450 trauma cases. These supplies are being delivered to the FMoH to be sent to Blue Nile. Humanitarian partners have also received requests to expand the field capacity of Damazine hospital (tents, medicines, surgical supplies, and outpatient treatment capacity) to cope with the growing caseload. They are also providing meals to around 4,500 displaced people.
 
Humanitarian organizations reached about 563,000 people in Blue Nile with humanitarian assistance and support during January-March 2022. The population of Blue Nile is estimated at 1.3 million.
 
These clashes are occurring at a time when humanitarian needs in Sudan are already at an all-time high. Over 14 million people, currently require some form of life-saving assistance. Upticks in violence further exacerbate the humanitarian situation, at a time when funding for the 2022 Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan stands at 20 per cent, more than halfway through the year.

Title: UNHCR and WHO join hands to improve access to health for refugees in Sudan
Content: 15 July 2022
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and WHO, the World Health Organization, signed a Letter of Understanding on 06 July 2022 to enhance health services for refugees and host communities in Sudan. Building on a 2020 Global Memorandum of Understanding, the agreement enacts the two agencies’ first national comprehensive partnership beyond emergency responses.
Sudan’s health system is buckling under several recurrent crises, with the current situation further exacerbating health and nutrition conditions for refugees and the communities which host them. Areas where refugees live often have limited health infrastructure and suffer shortages of medical personnel and supplies.
“We are glad to make official our continuing collaboration at a time when multiple emergencies and the ongoing economic crisis are undermining a fragile health system,” said Dr. Ni’ma Saeed Abid, WHO representative in Sudan. “The Sudanese health system will also benefit from the know-how and from our renewed joint efforts towards health for all,” Abid added.
The UN agencies will also strengthen their advocacy to Sudan’s government on key health issues affecting refugees, such as their full access to national health services.
“Health is a fundamental right for everyone. This agreement will help us support refugees access vital health services in the country,” said Axel Bisschop, UNHCR’s Representative in Sudan. “Increasing access to healthcare for forcibly displaced populations is one of the pledges Sudan made at the Global Refugee Forum in 2019. Therefore, this agreement is a good opportunity for UNHCR to continue its support to Sudan in meeting their commitments,” Bisschop added.
Among the main joint achievements in 2022, UNHCR and WHO supported early warning systems to detect potential disease outbreaks in a timely manner, in order to effect swift action and avoid further spread. The agencies continue to provide medicines and medical supplies to primary health facilities in refugee locations across the country, with about 32 such facilities also accessible by local populations.
The new partnership defines UNHCR and WHO roles and strategic areas of collaboration, maximizing coordination — including with national authorities — and optimising resources when responding to refugee influxes and other emergencies affecting both refugees and Sudanese.
Sudan hosts one of the largest refugee populations in Africa. As of 31 May 2022, over 1.1 million refugees are hosted in the country, mainly from South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic.

Title: Note to Correspondents – in response to questions on Sudan
Content: 05 July 2022
In response to questions asked at the noon briefing on Sudan, the Spokesperson had the following to say:
The Secretary-General takes note of the statement of the Chairperson of the Sovereign Council, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, yesterday, on the withdrawal of the military from the political talks facilitated by the AU-IGAD-UNITAMS Trilateral Mechanism. The Secretary-General hopes this creates the opportunity for Sudanese to reach an agreement that ultimately leads to a civilian-led transition to democracy in Sudan.
The Trilateral Mechanism encourages dialogue between all stakeholders to reach agreement on the way forward to restore a civilian-led democratic transition.
The Secretary-General supports the calls for independent investigation into incidents of violence, including through appropriate transitional justice mechanisms.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General
Content: 06 June 2022
The Secretary-General welcomes the efforts of the trilateral mechanism consisting of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS), the African Union Commission (AUC) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development Secretariat (IGAD) to facilitate a solution to the political crisis in the Sudan.
As Sudanese stakeholders prepare to engage in direct talks, he encourages them to participate in good faith and to continue to work towards establishing a conducive environment for a constructive dialogue in the interest of the Sudanese people.
The Secretary-General condemns all calls for violence and reiterates the importance of a peaceful atmosphere for the talks to be successful. He is also concerned about attempts to undermine the efforts of the trilateral mechanism and its envoys. The Secretary-General recalls that all forms of hate speech represent an attack on tolerance, undermine social cohesion and can lay the foundation for violence, setting back the cause of peace. He reaffirms his strong support for the work of UNITAMS, as it continues to support the Sudanese aspirations for democracy, peace and prosperity.

Title: Statement by Adama Dieng, UN Designated Expert on the situation of human rights in Sudan, at the end of his visit to the country on 4 June 2022
Content: 04 June 2022
The main purpose of this visit was to continue my engagement with the authorities on human rights concerns linked to the coup, follow up on the recommendations I made at the end of my last visit in February, and hear from civil society and victims of human rights violations.
Good morning to you all and thank you for coming.
First, I would like to say that I was shocked by the killing of a young man yesterday during the protests to mark the violent dispersal by security forces of the 3 June pro-democracy sit-in in Khartoum in 2019. I – and many others – had called for restraint yesterday. However, it seems that this call was not heeded and, according to our information, live ammunition was used to disperse protestors. There can be no justification for firing live ammunition at unarmed protestors. This young man reportedly died after he was shot in the chest. This is a tragedy - each of these deaths is a tragedy for Sudan - another young man whose family are in mourning today. His killing must be investigated immediately, and the perpetrator prosecuted. I will be following up on this and other cases of human rights violations in my ongoing engagement with the authorities.
Today marks the conclusion of my second visit to Khartoum in my capacity as United Nations Expert on Human Rights in Sudan. I would like to express my appreciation to the authorities for their cooperation and for facilitating my visit.
The main purpose of this visit was to continue my engagement with the authorities on human rights concerns linked to the coup, follow up on the recommendations I made at the end of my last visit in February, and hear from civil society and victims of human rights violations.
The outcome of this visit will also contribute to the Enhanced Interactive Dialogue on Sudan that will take place on 15 June 2022 during the 50th session of the Human Rights Council, at which the Council will consider the comprehensive written report on the human rights situation in Sudan that I prepared in collaboration with the Joint Human Rights Office in Sudan. The report will be made public on 7 June.
During this visit, I met with the acting Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Justice and the acting Attorney General, as well as the National Monitoring, Reporting and Follow-up Mechanism. Unfortunately, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo was not available to meet with me. I have a meeting scheduled with Lieutenant-General Abdulfattah Al-Burhan, Chairman of the Sovereign Council, before I leave this afternoon. I also met with civil society representatives, human rights defenders, victims of human rights violations or their families, UN officials and members of the diplomatic corps.
I was humbled and moved by the courage and determination of the human rights defenders and the victims of human rights violations and their families amid the challenges they face. Their experiences underline the complexity and magnitude of the human rights challenges confronted by the Sudanese people and the persistent gaps in accountability.
In my meetings with the authorities, I welcomed the lifting of the state of emergency and release of detainees arrested under emergency legislation, as well as the release last month of high-profile officials affiliated with the Dismantling Committee. However, I stressed that more bold and concrete actions are needed to improve the human rights situation and build confidence; I urged them to release all persons arrested under the emergency legislation, as was recommended by the Security and Defence Council; provide clear and public confirmation that the emergency decree of 24 December, which was linked to the duration of the State of Emergency, is no longer valid; to ensure a definitive end to the use of excessive force against protesters and arbitrary arrests and detention; and ensure there is visible progress in ongoing investigations into human rights violations and that they are conducted in line with international law and standards.
I flagged my deep concern at the human rights violations documented since the coup.  It is simply unacceptable that 99 people have been killed and more than 5,000 injured as a result of excessive use of force by the joint security forces responding to protests. I also raised my concern at the arbitrary and mass arrest and often incommunicado detention of resistance committee members, protestors, activists, media professionals and others in the context of protests; sexual and gender-based violence and acts of torture and ill-treatment in the course of arrest and during detention  and lack of fair trial and due process guarantees.
Regarding accountability, I was informed that the investigation committee set up by the authorities to investigate human rights violations committed since the coup has confirmed four cases of sexual violence in the context of the protests and has made progress in investigations into the killings of protesters. However, I stressed to the authorities the need to expedite the process and provide information to the public on the committee’s progress.
In the report to the Human Rights Council, I included reference to information provided by the authorities in February on the number of police officers killed and injured during protests. I understand that the case of Mohamed Adam, known as Tupac, a young protestor arrested on suspicion of his involvement in the death of a police brigadier general during a protest in January, whose family I met when I was here in February, has now moved to trial.  I urge the authorities to ensure the right of all those prosecuted to a fair trial.
I also shared my concern over the retrogression in the enjoyment of economic and social rights since the coup, due to the deterioration in the economy, political instability, increased prices – and the threat of poor harvests this year, which are forecast to dramatically increase the number of people living in poverty. I called on the authorities to take concrete steps to prevent this from happening, using the maximum of available resources and by seeking international support, as appropriate.
I also communicated my concern in relation to intercommunal conflicts and large-scale attacks against civilians in Darfur, including the events of 22 to 24 April in Kreinik that claimed the lives of at least 172 people, almost all from the Massalit tribe, and displaced thousands. These events must be investigated fully, and serious and comprehensive efforts taken to restore peace and hold those responsible to account. Implementation of the security arrangements envisaged in the Juba Peace Agreement needs to be accelerated and more joint security forces deployed in hotspot areas in Darfur to protect civilians and including Internally Displaced People, including women and children.
In conclusion, I encourage all Sudanese to contribute to efforts towards a political settlement and resumption of the important legal and institutional reforms started by the transitional government. In this respect, I would like to underline that any political initiatives must be founded on human rights if they are to succeed and include justice and reparations for victims and accountability for those responsible for human rights violations. There should also be a strong commitment to the protection of civilians.
Thank you once again to all who took their time to meet with me, thank you to the UN Joint Human Rights Office in Sudan for their continued support to my mandate, and thanks to all of you here today. May peace and prosperity come soon to this beautiful country!
Shukren Jezilen

Title: Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan on visit to West Darfur
Content: 25 May 2022
Ag Geneina: The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Khardiata Lo Ndiaye has re-iterated the commitment of humanitarian partners to support thousands of people displaced by inter-communal violence in parts of Kereneik and Ag Geneina, West Darfur after her visit to Ag Geneina.
“Humanitarian partners will continue to provide humanitarian assistance and support thousands of people who were displaced by violence and insecurity in parts of West Darfur over the past few weeks,” she said.

The Humanitarian Coordinator accompanied by the heads of the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and representatives from the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) visited a gathering site in Ag Geneina hosting some of the people who were displaced from Kereneik since April, and a group of nomads outside of Ag Geneina town where they interacted with people displaced and affected by the conflict, and heard their stories.

Fighting between Arab nomads and Masalit tribes took place from 22 – 25 April following the discovery of two deceased Arab nomads on 21 April near Hashaba village in Kereneik locality. The violence spilled over to Ag Geneina locality. The security situation improved after the deployment of security forces in Kereneik town, and no fighting has since been reported.

The local authorities in Kereneik reported that about 98,000 people have been displaced by the conflict. At least 165 people were killed and 136 injured during the clashes, according to local authorities.

UN agencies and humanitarian partners continue to provide thousands of newly displaced people and other affected people in Kereneik and other locations in West Darfur with humanitarian assistance, including food, non-food supplies and access to water, sanitation and health services.

The Humanitarian Coordinator reminds all stakeholders of their international legal obligation to protect all civilians, and civilian infrastructure, including health facilities, schools and water systems. The Humanitarian Coordinator urges all parties to the conflict to allow the free and safe movement of affected people in search of safety and assistance. She also echoed previous calls for an in-depth and transparent investigation, the results of which should be made public and help to identify the perpetrators of the violence and bring them to justice.

During January-March 2022, humanitarian partners have provided 794,000 of the most vulnerable people in West Darfur with food and other forms of humanitarian assistance. This is equivalent to about 42 per cent of the total population of West Darfur.

Title: Bachelet appalled by Darfur killings, warns against escalation
Content: 27 April 2022
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Wednesday called on the Sudanese authorities to protect the population of West Darfur and take urgent steps to prevent further outbreaks of communal violence after more than a hundred people were killed in attacks by armed assailants between 22 and 24 April.
“I am appalled by reports that at least 159 people were killed in Kerenik on 22 and 24 April, 107 injured and thousands displaced from their homes, and at least five villages in the region were also attacked,” she said. “I am concerned that this region continues to see repeated, serious incidents of intercommunal violence, with mass casualties.  While initial measures taken by the authorities to calm tensions are welcome, I urge the authorities to address the underlying causes of violence in this region and fulfil their responsibility to protect the population.”
More than 1,000 armed members of the Arab Rzeigat community attacked Kerenik town on 22 April following the killing of two Rzeigat men by unknown perpetrators. At least eight men belonging to the African Masalit tribe and seven Arab men were killed in the attack and at least 17 people from the Masalit community were injured, including one woman and three children.
Joint security forces were deployed to Kerenik on 23 April but reportedly retreated in the face of another large-scale attack by Rzeigat assailants on 24 April, during which they took control of the town for several hours, looted and torched hundreds of shops and houses and opened fire on public buildings where many had sought shelter, including a hospital and a police station. At least 151 people were killed, including at least 27 women and 17 children, and more than 90 injured. Three people were reportedly killed inside the hospital, including two medical workers. The violence also spread to El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur.
Bachelet called on the authorities to take immediate action to protect the population and assist the wounded and displaced. “I urge the authorities to ensure that the many people injured in Kerenik, who have still not received medical care, are quickly and safely evacuated to hospitals, and to facilitate humanitarian assistance for the displaced.”
“I call on the Sudanese authorities to conduct prompt, thorough, impartial and independent investigations into these attacks and hold all those responsible to account in accordance with international human rights law. The victims and their families have a right to effective remedies.”
I also urge them to accelerate the long-delayed implementation of the security measures set out in the Juba Peace Agreement which stipulated the establishment of a joint security-keeping force to protect civilians in Darfur, and to implement the National Action Plan for the Protection of Civilians.”
The human rights situation in Sudan has continued to deteriorate since the military coup of 25 October 2021.   The High Commissioner urges the Sudanese authorities to take credible steps to create an environment conducive to an inclusive political settlement that would put the democratic transition back on track. To this end, the High Commissioner supports the continued facilitation efforts of the UN-AU-IGAD tripartite mechanism.

Title: WORSENING FOOD CRISIS LOOMING IN SUDAN AMID ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DISPLACEMENT, AND RUINED CROPS
Content: 23 March 2022
Khartoum – The combined effects of conflict, economic crisis, and poor harvests are significantly affecting people’s access to food and will likely double the number of people facing acute hunger in Sudan to more than 18 million people by September 2022, warns the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP).
“There are already worrying signs that access, affordability, and the availability of food is shrinking for most people in Sudan, which is pushing more people deeper into poverty and hunger,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP Representative and Country Director in Sudan.
In recent months, there has been a surge in the numbers of people displaced due to conflict in parts of Darfur and the Kordofan region. This insecurity has eroded livelihoods, damaged farms, and triggered widespread unemployment.
The depreciation of the Sudanese Pound (SDG) in addition to rising food and transportation costs are making it harder for families to put food on the table. A lack of access to hard currencies is likely to result in the SDG further depreciating.
The Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report by FAO and WFP indicates that the domestic cereal production from the 2021/22 agricultural season is expected to produce 5.1 million metric tons. This will only cover the needs of less than two thirds of the population, leaving many reliant on humanitarian food assistance and dependant on imports of essential grains at prices beyond the reach of most people.
“Rising food prices and scarcity of essential agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and seeds mean that farmers have no other option than to abandon food production if they do not receive immediate support. This will likely have grave consequences not only for their food security but also on food availability in Sudan and may ultimately lead to more conflict and displacement,” said Babagana Ahmadu, FAO Representative in Sudan.
The situation looks grim for millions as the conflict in Ukraine is causing further spikes in food costs, as Sudan is dependent on wheat imports from the Black Sea region. Interruption to the flow of grain into Sudan will increase prices and make it more difficult to import wheat. Currently, local prices of wheat are at over US$ 550 per ton – an increase of 180 percent compared to the same period in 2021.
“The ripple effects created by the bullets and bombs landing in Ukraine will be felt far and wide, including here in Sudan, as families are set to suffer even further with basic meals becoming a luxury for millions. But at the same time, WFP finds itself in the awful position of not having enough resources to meet the ever growing needs,” added Mr Rowe.
In 2021, WFP was a lifeline for nearly 9 million people in Sudan who suffered through the turmoil of political unrest and economic instability. On top of life-saving food assistance, cash and livelihood support for families helped them not only survive, but also thrive. But this year, WFP food stocks in Sudan are running dangerously low and without new funding they will begin running out by May. A funding crunch, led by a US$270 million shortfall, has already forced WFP to prioritize the most vulnerable of the vulnerable people, meaning others in need go without, and further cuts may be necessary if WFP does not receive new funds immediately.
In 2021, FAO reached nearly 1.5 million vulnerable people in Sudan with life-saving livelihoods assistance to enhance the resilience of their agriculture-based livelihoods. This year, FAO requires USD 51.4 million to support 2 million vulnerable farming and pastoral households to produce their own food, keep their livestock alive and productive, and strengthen their resilience. Urgent support is required to provide essential agriculture inputs to vulnerable farming households before the main agriculture season starts in June, so that they can produce enough food and become self-reliant.

# # #
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Our goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide. We believe that everyone can play a part in ending hunger.

Title: Message by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator a.i., Ms. Mandeep O’Brien on the International Women’s Day
Content: 08 March 2022
“Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow”
On International Women’s Day 2022, we celebrate the power and potential of women and girls around the world.
On this day, on behalf of the United Nations Country Team in Sudan, I wish to acknowledge the critical roles that Sudanese women and girls continue to play to shape a brighter future for the country. Their courage and perseverance give us hope and added determination in pursuing our path to work even harder to empower them.
I commend the achievements and progress made in addressing gender issues, because without equality, we cannot achieve a sustainable or equitable future. We therefore urge the authorities to increase investment in the education and empowerment of women and girls. Their important participation and inclusion in social, political, and economic life, has the power to lift communities.
We must continue to promote and protect their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
This year’s theme of International Women’s Day also reminds us that women and girls are the most affected by climate change.
Despite their significant roles in natural resource management, women and girls have also generally been marginalized economically and politically, particularly those in the remote rural areas of the country.
Women and girls are effective and powerful leaders and change-makers for climate adaptation and mitigation. Their participation and leadership results in more effective climate action.
The empowerment and education of women and girls is a smart investment; it is essential for sustainable development, healthier households, and greater gender equality.
Without gender equality today, a sustainable future, and an equal future, remains beyond our reach.
This International Women’s Day, let’s collectively call for “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow”.

Title: WFP RESUMES ACTIVITIES IN NORTH DARFUR AFTER ATTACKS, LOOTING
Content: 01 March 2022
WFP has partially resumed operations in North Darfur after more than a month’s suspension following a series of attacks and looting of all three of its warehouses in El Fasher
Khartoum – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has partially resumed operations in North Darfur after more than a month’s suspension following a series of attacks and looting of all three of its warehouses in El Fasher late December 2021.
Nutrition programmes for malnourished children and pregnant and nursing mothers as well as school meals programmes have now resumed in the region with WFP aiming to reach 122,600 people with nutrition support and 321,000 school children with school meals this year.
“WFP’s priority is ensuring the hungriest children have food on their plates and people suffering malnutrition get the treatment they need,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP Representative and Country Director in Sudan. “We hope that security conditions will allow us to continue our work and we urge all parties to continue to provide safe access for humanitarian workers and protect humanitarian assets and supplies, so that we can reach people who are in need of assistance.”
As we face a year of unprecedented needs globally, assurances of safe access as well as increased resourcing is vital to save lives in Sudan. WFP is gradually resuming general food assistance to around 362,000 refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) using cash-based transfers, however a major funding shortfall of US$285 million for the next six months (March-August 2022) is jeopardising operations and lives.
Limited resources have been prioritised to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable people in Sudan are met but, even with this prioritization exercise, food stocks and cash are expected to run out starting April across the country. Without new funds, WFP may have no choice but to make further cuts and the impact could be devastating.

Title: UN human rights expert Adama Dieng concludes his official visit to Sudan (20 -24 February 2022)
Content: 24 February 2022
Statement by the UN Human Rights Expert for Sudan Adama Dieng at the press conference organized at the end of his visit to the country
Good morning to you all and thank you for coming.
First, let me express my thanks to the Authorities for inviting me to conduct this visit. Since my designation as Human Rights Expert for Sudan in November 2021, I have been monitoring the human rights situation remotely. So this, my first official visit, has given me the opportunity to observe the situation firsthand.
During my five days in Sudan, I have met with the attorney-general, the acting Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Justice, the National Reporting and Follow-up Mechanism (NMRF), the Unit on Combating Sexual Violence in the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Human Rights and Child Protection unit of the Rapid Support Forces, the Chief of the federal Police, a member of the Sovereignty Council in charge of Social Affairs, the civilian governor of Khartoum and head of the Joint Security Committee, as well as civil society representatives, human rights defenders, and crucially, many family members of victims of human rights violations. I have also met with diplomats, and heads of UN entities. The Chair of the Sovereign Council was unavailable to meet with me yesterday, but I am now scheduled to meet with him this morning before departing. I was also unable to meet with the Deputy chair of the Sovereignty Council as I am told that he has travelled.
I also visited Soba Prison and interacted with the prominent activists arrested recently and some of the young activists detained there.
I was deeply moved by the testimonies of loss and suffering I heard from many victims and their relatives. Stories of loved ones shot dead or injured while taking part in peaceful protests and families prevented from visiting their sons and daughters in sites of detention. I applaud them for their resilience and determined quest for justice and accountability.
In my meetings with the authorities, I welcomed the reported release of not less than 100 people from detention this week and called for the immediate release of all others still in detention. I raised concern at the extension of law enforcement powers to the general security forces during the State of Emergency and the temporary immunity from prosecution granted to these forces. I also welcomed the establishment of judicial mechanisms by the Attorney General to investigate alleged violations of the right to life and cases of sexual violence since the coup, while underscoring at the same that the investigations must be prompt, impartial, and independent and lead to justice and redress for victims. I look forward to the reports of these investigations.
I reiterated my concern about the security force’s repeated use of excessive force and live ammunition against protestors since the 25 October 2021 coup and noted that so far at least eighty-two (82) people have been killed as a result, more than 2,000 injured and others, mostly women, subjected to acts of sexual violence. I also expressed my concern at the negative effects of the State of Emergency on human rights, attacks on medical facilities and medical personnel, harassment of media and journalists, arbitrary arrests and detention of protesters and human rights activists, and use of torture and other ill-treatment.
I also pointed out to the authorities how the political and economic crisis is contributing to retrogression in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights of the Sudanese people, in particular the most vulnerable, women and children which were already precarious.
I called on the authorities to put an end to the use of excessive force against protesters, lift the state of emergency, release all protestors and activists still held in detention and ensure prompt and impartial investigations into allegations of human rights violations. Doing so would comply with their obligations under international human rights law and de-escalate tensions.
I also discussed with the authorities the situation in Darfur and existing gaps in the protection of civilians, and in particular the delay in the operationalization of the Security-Keeping Force, the situation of Internally Displaced People, many of whom continue to be killed, injured, or subjected to sexual violence, including in the context of inter-communal violence. I stressed the need for perpetrators to be held to account and to accelerate implementation of the security arrangements contained in the Juba Peace Agreement.
I welcome the assurances I received from the authorities about their resolve to accede to the CEDAW as soon as possible and called for improved respect and protection of the rights of women including those in detention.
I will be meeting with the High Commissioner for Human Rights next week to discuss my findings so far, prior to the 4 March interactive dialogue on the human rights situation in Sudan at the Human Rights Council.
I will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Sudan and to engage all the relevant parties in perspective of the written report on the human rights situation in Sudan to the Human Rights Council in June 2022. I am grateful to the UN Joint Human Rights Office in Sudan for its support during the visit.

Title: Attacks on warehouses force UN World Food Programme to suspend operations in El Fasher, North Darfur
Content: 30 December 2021
ROME – The World Food Programme (WFP) has suspended operations across the state of North Darfur in Sudan, following a series of attacks on all three of its warehouses in El Fasher, the state capital. The suspension could affect close to two million people in the area in 2022.
The attacks began on the evening of 28 December and looting continued into the morning of 30 December.
More than 5,000 metric tons of food appear to have been taken, with hundreds of looters also dismantling warehouse structures.
“WFP is outraged by these senseless attacks and condemns the continued looting of assistance and the destruction of its assets in the strongest possible terms. As a result, we have been forced to suspend WFP operations in North Darfur, effective immediately,” said David Beasley, WFP Executive Director.
“This theft has robbed nearly two million people of the food and nutrition support they so desperately need. Not only is this a tremendous setback to our operations across the country, but it endangers our staff and jeopardizes our ability to meet the needs of the most vulnerable families.”
WFP calls on the Government of Sudan to urgently provide adequate security, to recover the looted stocks and to provide guarantees so that WFP can safely resume its operations in North Darfur.
The losses in El Fasher cannot be replenished with stocks currently in Sudan without compromising assistance meant for vulnerable people in other parts of the country.
A total of 10.9 million people in Sudan need food security and livelihood assistance in 2022.

The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Mrs. Khardiata Lo NDIAYE, condemns the looting of food supplies from a World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse in El Fasher, North Darfur
Khartoum - The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Mrs. Khardiata Lo NDIAYE, condemns the looting of food supplies from a World Food Programme (WFP) warehouse in El Fasher, North Darfur.
On the evening of 28 December, the premises came under attack from unknown armed groups. This incident follows the looting and reported violence around the former UNAMID base in El Fasher last week.
“The United Nations and humanitarian partners are extremely concerned about the reports from North Darfur that humanitarian assets came under attack. This was food assistance meant for Sudan’s most vulnerable people. Humanitarian assistance should never be a target,” said Khardiata Lo N’diaye, Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan.
“One in three people in Sudan needs humanitarian assistance. Such an attack severely impedes our ability to deliver to the people who need it the most. We urgently ask all parties to adhere to humanitarian principles and allow the safe delivery of life-saving assistance,” she stated.
According to initial reports, the WFP warehouse located in the Borsa area of El Fasher town, the capital of North Darfur State, contained up to 1,900 metric tonnes of food, meant for hundreds of thousands of food-insecure people in that area. This comes amid unprecedented funding shortfalls for WFP, estimated at US$358 million. As of 29 December, the security situation had been restored, according to state authorities.
“We are grateful to the local authorities for intervening and preventing the situation from worsening. However, we call upon the Government of Sudan to step up efforts to protect and safeguard humanitarian premises and assets throughout Sudan” she concluded.
An estimated 14.3 million people in Sudan are need humanitarian assistance according to the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, of which 25 per cent require food security and livelihoods support.

“In my earlier engagements, I had the opportunity to meet and discuss with Dr Elhadi Idriss, a member of the Sovereign Council. I reiterated the expectations of the United Nations for the free and safe movement of all UN assets and the return of those that have been unlawfully seized by armed groups. I also met with Excellency Nimir Muhamed, the Wali of North Darfur, and discussed various issues of concern, particularly the importance of UN assets in the implementation of protection of civilians’ activities by various UN agencies. I stated that UNITAMS is committed and stands ready to assist the Government in fulfilling protection of civilians, human rights and rule of law priorities.” The DSRG said in her remarks.
In response, both Dr Elhadi Idriss and Excellency Nimir Muhamed expressed gratitude to the UN for the support and reaffirmed their commitment to ensure the security and safety of the UNAMID liquidation team and protection of UN assets.  They also assured that all efforts will be made to engage with former UNAMID national staff who have, for several days, blocked entry into the UNAMID log base in El Fasher.
Updating on ongoing efforts to strengthen protection of civilians in Darfur, Dr Elhadi Idriss informed the DSRSG that his mission to El Fasher was to intensify consultations with state security entities, including signatory parties to the Juba Peace Agreement, to finalise arrangements for the rapid deployment of the joint security protection forces. Dr Idriss emphasized that this was a priority considering the recent violence and protection challenges in Darfur.
A major outcome of the DSRSG’s engagements during her mission to Darfur was a decision taken by Dr Elhadi Idriss and Excellency Nimir Muhamed to allocate office space within the UNAMID log base for the use of the Permanent Ceasefire Committee and the North Darfur State Protection of Civilians Committee. This will help the two entities with facilities to enhance effective implementation of their respective mandates.

Title: JOINT STATEMENT OF THE UN IN SUDAN ON HUMAN RIGHTS DAY
Content: 10 December 2021
“Equality, reducing inequalities, advancing human rights”
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted seven decades ago, established the equality and dignity of every human being, and the duty of every government to provide an environment in which its people can enjoy and exercise their rights as the foundation for freedom, justice, and peace in the world.
The theme for International Human Rights Day this year of “Equality, reducing inequalities, advancing human rights” insists on the core principle of dignity and a world free from discrimination, a world in which women and youth are empowered and children’s rights are respected.
During this year’s “16 days of activism against gender-based violence” campaign, we have engaged with Sudanese women, including women activists from Darfur, who have all expressed their determination to continue to contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights in Sudan.
The Universal Declaration underscores the right to express one’s opinions freely, without interference, and for one’s views to be heard, on decisions that affect one’s wellbeing. People also have the right to demand a just and free society, based on the rule of law, as this is the only path towards prosperity and sustainable peace.
We have publicly raised our concern about all human rights violations, including the unlawful detention of hundreds of people, attacks against journalists and human rights defenders, and the death of many people as a result of excessive use of force by security forces during the recent protests. The people of Sudan have a right to protest peacefully; journalists must be allowed to do their work freely, and they and civil society activists and other human rights defenders should be protected. All those responsible for violations committed must be held accountable.
On this Human Rights Day, we would like to acknowledge the courage and determination of the people of Sudan to fight for a democratic society in which their rights and freedoms are respected, whoever they are. We will continue to support you.

Content: 21 November 2021
UNITAMS welcomes initial announcement of an agreement between Lt. Gen Abdel Fatah al-Burhan and Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok
UNITAMS welcomes today’s initial announcement of an agreement between Lt. Gen Abdel Fatah al-Burhan and Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok to reach consensus on resolving the constitutional and political crisis that was threatening the stability of the country.
We stress the need to protect the constitutional order to safeguard the basic freedoms of political action, freedom of speech, and peaceful assembly. The transition partners will need to urgently address unresolved issues to complete the political transition in an inclusive manner, with respect for human rights and the rule of law. We call on all parties to the political process in Sudan to include the voices of the youth to address the demands of the Sudanese people. Women’s meaningful participation and the advancement of their hard-earned rights and role in the democratic transition must be maintained.
We deplore the loss of so many Sudanese lives over the last weeks and as per today’s agreement, we stress the need for transparent investigations and accountability to ensure justice for the lives of these victims. We also expect that all those arrested on or after 25 October will be released immediately as a first gesture to implement this agreement.
Their concerns must be addressed in a way that guarantees the achievement of the goals of the Sudanese revolution: freedom, peace, and justice.  We also urge all Sudanese stakeholders to engage constructively and in good faith to restore the constitutional order and transition.
UNITAMS remains ready to provide the necessary support during the transition process towards the success of an inclusive transition and the realization of the aspirations of the Sudanese people for peace, inclusive development, and democracy.

Title: Bachelet condemns killings of peaceful protesters in Sudan
Content: 18 November 2021
Press briefing notes on Sudan

GENEVA – UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Thursday condemned the killing by security forces of at least 39 people in Sudan since the 25 October military coup, 15 of whom were reportedly shot dead yesterday alone during protests in Khartoum, Khartoum-Bahri and Omdurman.
“Following our repeated appeals to the military and security authorities to refrain from the use of unnecessary and disproportionate force against demonstrators, it is utterly shameful that live ammunition was again used yesterday against protesters,” Bachelet said.
“Shooting into large crowds of unarmed demonstrators, leaving dozens dead and many more injured, is deplorable, clearly aimed at stifling the expression of public dissent, and amounts to gross violations of international human rights law.”
According to reliable medical sources, more than 100 people were wounded during protests yesterday – 80 of whom sustained gunshot injuries to their upper bodies and heads, according to medical sources. There was also heavy use of teargas. Arrest operations were reported to have taken place already before, as well as during and after the demonstrations. Police issued a statement stating that 89 police officers had also been injured.
From around 12h00 yesterday local time, the military authority imposed a total shutdown of phone and mobile communications across the country, in addition to the continued shutdown of the internet services, effectively cutting off Sudan from the world.  Only satellite links continued to function.
“A communication shutdown means people are unable to call for ambulances to treat injured protesters, families are unable to check on the safety of their loved ones, and hospitals are unable to reach doctors as emergency rooms filled up, to name just a few very real and serious consequences,” the High Commissioner said. “Blanket Internet and telecommunications shutdowns violate core principles of necessity and proportionality and contravene international law.”
Since the military coup, journalists, particularly those perceived to be critical of the authorities, have been targeted. Journalists have been arbitrarily arrested, attacked while reporting, and had their homes and offices raided by security forces. There is also disturbing information of attempted abduction of journalists by armed assailants in plain clothes.
“With the Internet shutdowns, the role of journalists in getting essential information out on the current situation is particularly crucial, but I fear the increasingly hostile environment against them may lead to self-censorship, and further threaten media pluralism and independence,” the High Commissioner said.
“I urge the authorities to immediately release all those who have been detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as well as all detained political actors – as they have publicly pledged to do.”
Bachelet stressed that members of the security forces as well as political and military leaders responsible for unnecessary and disproportionate use of force against protesters must be held accountable in line with international human rights law and standards. The High Commissioner also stressed the need to ensure that healthcare workers are not targeted for providing medical care to injured protesters, and their essential work is not hampered.

Title: UN Human Rights Chief designates Adama Dieng as expert on human rights in Sudan
Content: 12 November 2021
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet designated Adama Dieng as an expert on human rights in Sudan, following a request from the UN Human Rights Council
GENEVA  – UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Friday designated Adama Dieng as an expert on human rights in Sudan, following a request from the UN Human Rights Council.
The UN Human Rights Council held a special session on Sudan on 5 November to discuss the implications of the 25 October military takeover on the human rights situation in the country. At the special session, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution HRC/RES/S-32/1, which requested the High Commissioner to designate an expert on human rights in Sudan.
The High Commissioner has duly designated Adama Dieng, a Senegalese national. According to the resolution, Dieng will monitor the developing human rights situation in Sudan with the assistance of, and in close cooperation with, the UN Joint Human Rights Office in Sudan. In performing his duties, he will pay special attention to victims and ensure a gender perspective. He will engage with all relevant parties, including civil society.
The work undertaken by Dieng will contribute to the written report that the High Commissioner will present to the Human Rights Council in its fiftieth session in June 2022.
Adama Dieng is currently a member of the United Nations Internal Justice Council and the Special Adviser to the Higher Committee of Human Fraternity. He is a former UN Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide. Before joining the UN, for 10 years, he was the Secretary-General of the International Commission of Jurists. Dieng also served as Registrar of the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda from 2001 to 2008. He helped establish the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and produced the draft of the African Convention to fight corruption. He has led many fact-finding missions on human rights and rule of law as well as trial observation missions.
He will assume his duties immediately, and his term of office as an expert for Sudan will conclude upon restoration of the country’s civilian-led government.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights urges all Sudanese parties to cooperate with Dieng to ensure the implementation of the Human Rights Council resolution 32/1.

Title: Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Liz Throssell
Content: 12 November 2021
We call on military leaders to ensure that the Sudanese people’s rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fully respected
Geneva - Ahead of the protests planned to take place across Sudan tomorrow, we call on military leaders to ensure that the Sudanese people’s rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fully respected. Security forces need to receive clear instructions that they must not disperse peaceful assemblies and must refrain from the use of force unless absolutely necessary, as a measure of last resort and only to the minimum extent required.
With the reported killing of 14 people and injury of some 300 during protests between 25 and 30 October due to the unnecessary and disproportionate use of force by military and security forces, it is crucial that all necessary steps are taken to ensure that there is no further bloodshed at protests planned for tomorrow and beyond.
Those responsible for the violence, including the use of live ammunition against demonstrators – must be promptly and transparently held accountable, in line with international human rights laws and standards.
We also urge the authorities to release immediately all individuals who remain arbitrarily detained since the 25 October coup, most of whom have been held incommunicado now for more than two weeks. Our Joint UN Human Rights Office in Sudan has verified the arrest of 57 people, including Government officials, political and civil society actors, human rights defenders and journalists, since 25 October. We understand 10 of these people have since been released, but we have yet to receive a written response to our formal request for information about and access to the detainees. Access has also been denied to their lawyers and family members.
In addition to these arbitrary detentions, hundreds of protesters have also been arrested, including, reportedly, 87 teachers. While most are held for a short time and then released, we understand some remain detained.
Internet and telecommunications services remain curtailed, seriously hampering the ability of people to communicate in the midst of a crisis, as well as damaging livelihoods. We call on the authorities to respect the Khartoum court ruling yesterday, ordering telecommunications companies to restore Internet services to all their customers pending further proceedings. Blunt measures such as blanket Internet and telecommunications shutdowns, sometimes for prolonged periods, violate the principles of necessity and proportionality and contravene international law.
The appointment of the Sovereign Council is a setback to efforts to obtain a political agreement.  As the High Commissioner for Human Rights has stressed, meaningful, inclusive, participatory dialogue is urgently needed to ensure a swift return to civilian rule in Sudan.

UNITAMS strongly condemns the detention of members of the FFC’s Central Council after their meeting with the SRSG.
It has been reported that Taha Osman Isahaq, Sharif Mohamed Osman and Hamza Farouk were arrested near UNITAMS HQ yesterday afternoon.
We call upon the military leadership to cease arresting politicians and activists and to stop committing further human rights violations.
These arrests which took place after a meeting on our premises undermines our good offices role.
We urge for the immediate release of those detained on or after 25 October. These detentions hinder efforts to restore stability and a return to the path of democratic transition in Sudan and nullifies the impact of the release of four of the detained ministers yesterday.

Title: UN expert deplores deadly military response to protests
Content: 02 November 2021
UN human rights expert expresses alarm at the ongoing violent repression of peaceful demonstrations in Sudan, and the excessive use of force against those protesting the military coup d'état of 25 October
GENEVA  – A UN human rights expert today expressed alarm at the ongoing violent repression of peaceful demonstrations in Sudan, and the excessive use of force against those protesting the military coup d'état of 25 October.
The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to peaceful assembly and association, Clément Voule, urged the military to immediately cease its clampdown on peaceful protests and to listen to the legitimate demands of the Sudanese people for returning to the constitutional transition.
"As people have mobilised and staged peaceful assemblies across Sudan, demanding that the military reinstate the civilian government, I have received disturbing reports of unlawful killings and injuries, including as a result of the use of live ammunition to disperse protesters, and beating of protesters by military and security personnel," Voule said.
"In light of the serious allegations of human rights violations and restrictions on the rights to peaceful assembly and association, I am calling on the de-facto authorities to investigate all reports of the use of force against peaceful protests".
"They must also immediately refrain from the use of unnecessary and disproportionate force, withdraw the military from the streets and respect and protect the right to life and physical integrity of protesters. All those who are arrested for taking part in peaceful protests must be immediately and unconditionally released."
Since the 25 October coup, at least 12 people have been killed as a result of excessive use of force against peaceful protests and around 300 have been hurt, according to medical sources. According to the same sources, many of those injured sustained gunshot wounds.
Most recently, the mass protests on 30 October 2021, called "the march of millions", were met with excessive use of force, which resulted in the killing of at least three protesters due to the use of live ammunition by military and security forces, the expert said. More than 100 others were wounded by live ammunition and tear gas. Some sustained burn injuries and had breathing difficulties as a result of the use of tear gas, while others including women were also beaten.
Reports indicate an organised campaign of arrests of activists, including journalists, students, human rights defenders and lawyers. "I am deeply concerned for the safety of those arrested as some have been allegedly held incommunicado, which exposes them to risks of torture or ill-treatment," Voule said.
"The whereabouts of many of those who have been detained are not yet known and they have not been able to contact their families or lawyers, which is considered as enforced disappearance. I am also concerned by reports of security forces raiding civil society organisations and media outlets.
"The use of militarized forces for crowd control poses a serious threat to the right to life of civilians and protesters. Concerns at deployment of militarised forces to manage peaceful protests are heightened as the military and security forces have not been effectively reformed or held accountable for the serious human rights violations committed against protesters in 2019, as noted by UN experts last year."
Voule also expressed concerns about the shutdown of the internet and disruptions to telecommunications services, which prevents people from accessing vital information, and obstructs monitoring and reporting on human rights violations. He called for the services to be restored immediately.
The UN expert applauded the decision by the Human Rights Council to hold a special session on Sudan on 5 November. "I urge a robust response to ensure protection of human rights through monitoring, reporting and accountability for human rights violations since 25 October 2021, including in the context of peaceful protests," he said.

Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations, as members of the Friends of Sudan Group, strongly condemn the ongoing military takeover in Sudan. We call for the immediate release of officials who have been unlawfully detained.
The Friends of Sudan call for the restoration of all transitional arrangements and institutions as defined in the Constitutional Document. Any attempts by the military to unilaterally modify these provisions and upend the critical civilian-military partnership are unacceptable.
The actions of the security forces deeply jeopardize Sudan’s hard-won political, economic and legal gains made over the past two years and put Sudan’s security, stability and reintegration into the international community at risk.
The aspirations of the Sudanese people for democracy, human rights, peace and prosperity are clear and were reiterated once again last week through protests across the country. They must be respected. Free and inclusive dialogue is the only way forward.
The Friends of Sudan reaffirm their commitment to supporting the political transition and the realization of the aspirations of the Sudanese people.

Content: 25 October 2021
These actions threaten the Juba Peace Agreement and jeopardize the important progress made towards democracy and respect for human rights
GENEVA  – “I strongly condemn today’s military coup in Sudan and the declaration of a nationwide state of emergency, the suspension of key articles of the Constitutional Document and the governing bodies. These actions threaten the Juba Peace Agreement and jeopardize the important progress made towards democracy and respect for human rights.
The military authorities must abide by the constitutional order and applicable international law, withdraw from the streets, and resolve any differences they have with the civilian component of the Transitional Council through dialogue and negotiation.
I utterly deplore the reported arrest of the Prime Minister, several Ministers, leaders of the Forces of the Freedom and Change and other civil society representatives, and call for their immediate release.
Blanket internet shutdowns contravene international law, and Internet and mobile services must be restored, as they are essential for people to seek and receive information, particularly in these unsettling circumstances. We remind military and security forces to refrain from unnecessary and disproportionate use of force, to respect people’s freedom of expression, as well as the right of peaceful assembly.
It would be disastrous if Sudan goes backwards after finally bringing an end to decades of repressive dictatorship. The country needs to move forward to consolidate democracy, a wish expressed countless times by the Sudanese people, including loudly and clearly on the streets last week and today.”

Title: Note to Correspondents: UNGA Virtual High-Level Side Event on Sudan
Content: 30 September 2021
Chair Summary
The United Nations and the Government of Norway convened a High-Level Side Event on Sudan on 30 September 2021 on the margins of the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Delegations from 24 Member States and 8 international and regional organizations, attended.
The Event commenced with opening remarks by H.E. Mr. António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and H.E. Ms. Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway, followed by remarks by H.E. Mr. Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan. Subsequently, Member States and organizations delivered remarks on support to Sudan’s transition to an inclusive democracy.
The Secretary-General commended the Sudanese people for their perseverance in this historic transition that seeks to realize their aspirations for an inclusive, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic future. Over the past two years, the transitional Government has reached important milestones and continued to advance democratic governance and peacemaking efforts, despite ongoing challenges, notably in the establishment of transitional institutions and securing justice for past abuses. The High-Level Side Event provided an opportunity to take stock of the overall progress achieved thus far and reaffirm international support for the transition at a critical time. The Secretary-General called on all parties to remain committed to the transition, underscoring that any effort to undermine it will jeopardise the hard-earned progress made on political and economic fronts.
In his remarks, Prime Minister Hamdok elaborated on the accomplishments and challenges of the Sudanese transition. He highlighted Sudan’s legislative reform process, economic reform efforts that had enabled it to begin receiving debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and move Sudan towards economic progress and improved conditions for investment. Prime Minister Hamdok also highlighted ongoing efforts to implement the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA), signed almost a year ago, as well as efforts to reach agreement with non-signatory armed movements. He announced that agreement had been reached on the establishment of the Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism, a key strategic coordination mechanism will help ensure the timely implementation of the JPA. The Prime Minister informed participants of the significant challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the influx of refugees into Sudan, prevailing security challenges, the deep economic hardships faced by the population, and continuing challenges to the peace process and the political transition. He stressed that Sudan remained eager to deepen its partnership with the international community to bolster the country’s long road to socioeconomic recovery, attract investment and to achieve sustainable peace and inclusive development. Finally, noting the recent failed attempt to overthrow the transitional Government, Prime Minister Hamdok  expressed his appreciation to international partners for their solidarity in condemning and denouncing the coup attempt, and reaffirmed Sudan’s unwavering commitment to overcoming challenges facing its multidimensional transition.
Participants paid tribute to the progress achieved by the transitional Government, and to the sacrifices made by the Sudanese people since the start of the revolution. They expressed deep concern about the attempted coup d’état in Khartoum on 21 September, condemned any effort to undermine Sudan’s progress and called on Sudan to stay the course and complete its historic transition. With rising insecurity and intercommunal tensions in Darfur, the east and elsewhere in the country, participants called for more effective protection for civilians and reiterated their commitment to supporting Sudan in these efforts. Participants underscored the need for implementation of the JPA, welcomed the establishment of the Permanent Ceasefire Committee and urged further progress in the operationalisation of other security arrangements. Participants also welcomed the establishment of the JPA Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism as a confidence-building measure which will serve as a critical forum to discuss and resolve contentious issues.
Participants further underscored their commitment to help facilitate the conditions for the success of the transition, which remains of critical importance for the stability and the prosperity of the entire region. The meeting welcomed international efforts to mobilise resources in support of Sudan since the onset of the transition. Such efforts had resulted in significant pledges and other in-kind support. One of the most important symbols of the international community’s commitment to Sudan’s transition was the establishment of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) on 3 June 2020. The Mission continues to spearhead international support to the Sudanese-led and nationally owned political and peace processes. It also supports the transitional Government in the protection of civilians and in mobilizing resources for economic and humanitarian assistance. UNITAMS carries out programs in peacebuilding, rule of law and human rights. Participants underscored the importance of close partnership between the United Nations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, including in addressing regional challenges to peace and security in the wider Horn of Africa.
The meeting welcomed steps undertaken to increase the meaningful and effective participation of women in the peace process and stressed the importance of securing gender responsive outcomes. In this regard, participants stressed that women’s empowerment and inclusion in all aspects of the transition enhances the prospects for lasting peace, stability, social cohesion and economic advancement. Participants also emphasized the importance of the rapid establishment of the Transitional Legislative Council with 40 per cent representation of women. The meeting encouraged transitional authorities to also make a concerted effort to ensure that the aspirations of youth are being met.
Finally, participants committed to continue providing support to Sudan and mobilizing all available bilateral and multilateral assistance, in line with sustained progress on the ground and towards a more peaceful and prosperous Sudan.

Content: 05 September 2021
UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Mme Khardiata Lo Ndiaye, today addressed the first high-level meeting of Sudan’s international partners and the National Mechanism for the Protection of Civilians.
Khartoum  – The United Nations Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Mme Khardiata Lo Ndiaye, today addressed the first high-level meeting of Sudan’s international partners and the National Mechanism for the Protection of Civilians.
The meeting was chaired by the Minister of Cabinet Affairs, H.E. Mr. Khalid Omer Yousif, with participation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, H.E. Mariam Al Sadig, the Minister of Interior, H.E. Lt Gen Izzaddin Al Sheikh, representatives of the Troika (the United States, the United Kingdom, and Norway), Heads and representatives of Diplomatic Missions, and UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes.

Title: UNHCR and IOM welcome government new action plan to combat human trafficking in Sudan
Content: 31 August 2021
Sudan launches its 2021–2023 national action plan to combat human trafficking
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) commend the Sudanese Government for the launch of its 2021–2023 National Action Plan (NAP) to Combat Human Trafficking.
The plan, officially launched yesterday by the National Committee for Combating Human Trafficking (NCCT), seeks to reinforce Sudan’s efforts to curb human trafficking and to build on the previous action plan for 2017-2019.
The new NAP, which was drafted with the support of the Counter-Trafficking and Mixed Migration Working Group (CTWG), of which UNHCR and IOM are co-chairs, has a broader scope and takes into consideration contributions from all concerned actors including officials and civil society.
“The launch of this National Action Plan shows the renewed commitment of the Government of Sudan to tackle human trafficking, which is also a key concern for refugees and asylum seekers,” said Axel Bisschop, UNHCR Representative in Sudan. “We will continue to work with the NCCT, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other partners to enhance the protection of forcibly displaced who have fallen victims of trafficking and to find solutions for them,” he added.
Sudan has a complex and diverse migration profile as a major source, transit and destination country at the centre of multiple migration routes. Over the past decade, thousands of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been transiting to and through Sudan which currently hosts millions of displaced persons many of which are at increased risk of exploitation and abuse, including human trafficking.
“The National Action Plan is a way forward to coordinate the efforts in the prevention of trafficking, protection and assistance to victims of trafficking in Sudan,” said Catherine Northing, IOM Chief of Mission in Sudan. "IOM is committed to continue its efforts to support the government together with UNHCR and other partners to protect the human rights of and provide assistance to victims of trafficking.”
The overarching goal of the new NAP is to prevent and respond to human trafficking and migrant smuggling, which women and children are at heightened risk of. The plan outlines activities aimed at eradicating trafficking in persons.
While the NCCT will coordinate collective actions to fulfil the NAP’s objectives and priorities, UNHCR and IOM calls on the international community to fully support concerned authorities and engaged actors in the implementation of this plan.

Title: Federal Ministry of Health, UNDP and WHO launch improved HIV treatment
Content: 02 August 2021
Federal Ministry of Health, UNDP, WHO and partners have commenced the roll-out of a new HIV treatment in Sudan, supported by the Global Fund
The Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Health Organization (WHO) and partners have commenced the roll-out of a new HIV treatment in Sudan, supported by the Global Fund. The new medication is part of WHO’s recommended treatment guidelines and will help the 46,000 people estimated to be living with HIV in Sudan. The rollout was initially planned for 2020, however to the due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed.
Following the adoption of the WHO treatment guidelines by the FMoH, the medication is being introduced at all 42 HIV treatment centres nationwide. The rollout has been accompanied by FMoH, UNDP, WHO and UNAIDS-supported training for healthcare staff, and improvements to individual patient monitoring.
On the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, antiretroviral (ARV) drug ‘Dolutegravir’ is recommended as the preferred treatment for all populations, based on its effectiveness, fewer side effects, high genetic barrier for resistance and improved life expectancy of the person taking it.
Planned for nationwide deployment in phases over the next three years, the first phase expects to have 45% of current antiretroviral treatment recipients transitioned to the new medication by the end of the year.
“This is a step forward in improving the lives of those living with HIV, one we are thrilled to see happen,” said [Thowiba Khougli head of the Procurement and Supply Chain Management Unit at DCD-FMOH]. “This transition is thanks to the ongoing support and strong relationships with our partners - the Global Fund, UNDP, WHO and others – and our thanks go to them for the assistance in delivering a life-improving outcome to some of our most vulnerable.”
In the second, planned for 2022, enrolment is expected to reach 75% of those living with HIV, growing to 90% by 2023.
In preparation for the launch, the Ministry of Health’s Disease Control Directorate in close collaboration with WHO, undertook extensive work to adapt the treatment guidelines for Sudan’s conditions, conducting dialogues with healthcare providers, national organizations, international organizations, policymakers, and people living with HIV. Utilizing Global Fund support, UNDP supported procurement of medication into Sudan, with the Ministry providing training for medical staff with technical support from UNDP, WHO, and other partners.

Title: UNAMID completes drawdown, begins liquidation
Content: 29 June 2021
Sites handed over to Government to benefit health, education and social services
The African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) will complete its drawdown exercise on 30 June 2021, as requested by the UN Security Council resolution 2559 (2020) which ended the Mission’s mandate.
Mr. M’Baye Babacar Cissé, Assistant Secretary-General, was tasked to oversee the drawdown period, manage personnel and asset repatriation, transfer team sites to local authorities, and engage with the Government on relevant issues.
Over the past four months, UNAMID handed over 14 team sites to the Government, who committed to using them for civilian purposes as in line with the Framework Agreement signed on 4 March 2021. Facilities are to be utilized for health care, education, and other social services, including vocational training and community centers, as identified by community members.
While it is the responsibility of the Central Government to ensure the safety and protection of the sites, the Darfur state governments remain responsible for ensuring the facilities are being used as intended.
The Government of Sudan established the Joint Task Force and the State Handover Committees to be UNAMID’s key interlocutors during the drawdown. It was through this engagement that the Mission heard the specific needs of each community and identified ways to meet those needs through the provision of assets such as water and sewage trucks, water treatment equipment, generators, and vehicles, among others. So far, UNAMID, as an integral part of its drawdown, provided Darfur communities with 193 vehicles, including 27 water and sewage trucks and 196 generators. The Mission also donated its clinic in Zalingei as well as medical facilities in Nyala and Kabkabiya for use by the local communities.
“Good coordination and cooperation with the Government of Sudan has been critical for meeting the tight timeline and benchmarks set by the Security Council for the drawdown period. Similarly, it will be important for the Government to ensure the protection of the Logistics Base and the repatriation of remaining staff to facilitate a seamless liquidation phase,” said Mr. Cissé.
Due to its size, both in terms of personnel and assets, as well as its geographical footprint, UNAMID faced challenges during the drawdown period, but was able to undertake it without major incidents.
During UNAMID’s 13-year mandate, more than 100,000 military and police peacekeepers were contributed by dozens of countries from around the world. At its peak deployment in 2011, it had nearly 23,000 troops and police.
At the beginning of the drawdown period in January 2021, 7,000 military, police, and civilian personnel remained to be separated and repatriated, with over 6,000 now repatriated.
UNAMID,  one of the largest peacekeeping operations in the history of the United Nations,  created a security environment in Darfur and will be departing with a history of achievements supporting the protection of civilians, particularly the internally displaced persons, community stabilization and rule of law support, the provision of humanitarian aid as well as supporting the implementation of the peace process. The Mission also worked to empower women; addressed sexual and gender-based violence; protected and promoted human rights; and helped with the fight against COVID-19.
As the Mission transitions into its liquidation phase, which is likely to last another year, significant tasks remain such as the transition and handover of the El Fasher camp to the authorities in Darfur, the disposal of remaining assets, the completion of the environmental clean-up and restoration, the disposal of hazardous materials including expired ammunition, and the repatriation of equipment and uniformed and civilian personnel.
As authorized by the Security Council, the Mission in its year-long liquidation phase scheduled to commence on 1 July 2021, will maintain a guard unit consisting of 363 formed police unit to protect UN personnel, facilities and assets inside the El Fasher Logistics Base. In parallel, Sudanese joint forces will continue to be deployed outside the Base, under the direction of the Government of Sudan and in close coordination with the UNAMID Liquidation Team. These forces will have the shared responsibility of securing the perimeter of the base, providing safety and security for UN personnel and ensuring that onward convoys of assets and contingent owned equipment are able to proceed without incidents.
While UNAMID completed its mandate on 31 December 2020 and the drawdown by 1 July 2021 and is now in a full-fledged liquidation phase, the United Nations is not leaving Sudan. UNAMID has coordinated regularly with the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) and the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), sharing best practices and lessons learned on its work in Darfur to consolidate and scale up the peacebuilding gains that have been made.

Title: Joint UN Press Release: UN AGENCIES IN SUDAN REACH CONFLICT-AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IN NON-GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AREAS FOR FIRST TIME IN A DECADE
Content: 13 June 2021
For the first time in 10 years, UN humanitarian agencies have been able to access conflict-affected communities in the five non-governmental areas controlled by SPLM-N El Hilu
KHARTOUM – For the first time in ten years, United Nations humanitarian agencies have been able to access conflict-affected communities in the five non-governmental areas controlled by the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) El Hilu in South Kordofan and Blue Niles states of Sudan.
A series of humanitarian missions to the five isolated enclaves has concluded, just as renewed peace talks between the Government of Sudan and SPLM-N are ongoing in Juba, South Sudan. These five areas have largely been cut-off from support over the last decade and the missions’ findings indicate people are in dire need of improved food security, education, health, and water and sanitation services.
“This response marks a significant breakthrough in humanitarian access and response to conflict-affected communities previously unreached by UN humanitarian assistance. We commend the local efforts to support essential needs during the years of hardship. The humanitarian community in Sudan is calling for increased access and critically needed assistance to support these marginalized communities,” said Khardiata Lo N’diaye, Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary General and Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan.
United Nations humanitarian agencies have not been able to reach or provide life-saving assistance to support people in the five locations since 2011, when conflict broke out between the Government of Sudan and the SPLM-N. Gaining humanitarian access to these communities provides a critical opportunity to improve lives and rebuild livelihoods.
“Communities in these areas have been struggling and surviving on little or nothing for a decade. Access for humanitarian agencies so they can increase their assistance to these vulnerable communities is critical. With improved food security and other opportunities, families will be able to reintegrate with the rest of Sudan and start to recover and rebuild,” said Eddie Rowe, United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Country Director in Sudan.
WFP delivered 100 metric tons of nutritious biscuits for 25,000 school children in 83 schools on the five missions. This was the first assistance that people in these isolated areas had received from the UN in the last decade due to conflict and access constraints. A lack of food for students is one of the main challenges in maintaining school enrolment in these isolated areas. Providing school meals is among the top priorities for WFP’s response as access continues to open.
“Whilst these missions mark a major development, we need to ensure that humanitarian access to children and communities in need is always granted. No conditions should ever be set on access; humanitarian assistance should be provided at all times and from all places to those that need it. Findings from this mission are bleak. These children have been entirely ‘left behind’. We have to act now to ensure these children have a future. Collectively, efforts must be made to ensure access and sustain and scale up assistance,” said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Sudan.
Expanding humanitarian access to SPLM-N controlled enclaves is crucial to providing urgent assistance to an estimated 800,000 people in these areas, who desperately need relief following years of isolation. Ramping up support will help stabilize communities and pave the path for peacebuilding efforts, while reinforcing the UN’s commitment to assist marginalised populations in Sudan.
The UN World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) participated in missions over the last six weeks to five isolated areas in SPLM-N El Hilu controlled areas including Zozak and Amora in Blue Nile State and Kau/Nyaro, Rashad/New Tegali, and Western Jebels in South Kordofan State.

KHARTOUM – The Ministry of Agriculture and Forests of Sudan, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations World Food Programme today called for greater investment in Sudan’s agriculture and humanitarian assistance, as a new food security assessment shows that a record number of Sudanese will face acute food insecurity in the coming lean season.
The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) results for Sudan say 9.8 million people are projected to be acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 3 and above) across the country throughout the lean season from June through September.
More than 20 percent of Sudan’s population is projected to be facing acute food insecurity starting this month, the highest figure reported in the history of the IPC in Sudan.
‘‘Sudan, through its Ministry of Agriculture and Forests, has as its main objective to combat poverty and avail food for the nation. It also contributes significantly in food security for the region. Such achievements can be attained by intensive investments in agriculture by the support of the government, active organizations, mainly FAO and WFP and other partners,” said Eltahir Harbi, Minister of Agriculture and Forests.
The key drivers of food insecurity in Sudan include floods, recurrent droughts, economic decline, inflation and displacement because of conflict.
The economy of Sudan is highly dependent on agriculture, which is the most important economic sector. Agriculture employs 43 percent of Sudan’s labour force and accounts for about 30 percent of GDP (ILO estimates of 2019, & World Bank report). Sudan is one of the largest livestock producing countries in Africa and the Arab world, where the livestock sector contributes to the livelihoods of at least 26 million people.
“Agricultural production promotes livelihoods, save lives and restores livelihoods. Urgent action is needed to safeguard livelihoods and promote recovery through cash interventions, supplementary livestock feeding, and livelihood recovery and farming packages,’’ said Babagana Ahmadu, FAO Representative to Sudan.
The latest IPC results revealed that major acute food insecurity exists in 10 out of the 18 states in terms of caseload and proportion of food insecure populations compared to only two states in the penulatimate IPC analysis from June to August 2019.
“Urgent action is required to save lives and that is our priority as WFP. It’s not just about saving lives; it’s about changing lives. All partners – UN, INGOs, Government, and private sector, including potential investors, must come together to reduce food insecurity in the country so we can reach zero hunger by 2030,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP Representative and Country Director in Sudan.
This latest IPC analysis was released just a week after a high-level meeting in Paris, hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, which advocated for broader economic reforms. The high levels of food insecurity underscore the need for investments in Sudan’s agricultural sector and productivity.
‘‘Creating an investment climate for the private sector to be actively involved in agriculture and agribusiness should be emphasized at all levels so as to pave way for small farmers and agro-industry owners to play significant role in the development of the agriculture sector,” said Ahmadu.
The IPC analysis report is available here.

Title: Key national parks in Sudan receive increased protection, support for improved management, local communities and ecotourism
Content: 30 May 2021
The Government of Sudan, UNDP and partners launch $23.6m initiative to improve protection for three national parks
KHARTOUM: Ahead of World Environment Day, a US$23.6m initiative to improve protection for three national parks in Sudan has been announced by the Higher Council for Environment and Natural Resources (HCENR), the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning, and the United Nations Development Programme, with $4.6m of financing from the Global Environmental Facility and the remainder from UN and national contributions, and partners.
The five-year project will see over 20,000 km2 of land and marine areas supported – across Dinder National Park, Jebel El Dair National Park, and the Red Sea-based Dungonab Bay - Mukkawar Island Marine National Park. This will be complemented by assistance for nearby communities and businesses, national policies, and wildlife and park administration.
“This project will provide Sudan with opportunities to go into more development in all communities, to ensure biodiversity and protect natural resources,” said H.E. Dr. Amin Saleh Yassin, Undersecretary of Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning. “We thank all partners for contributing and moving forward towards sustainable development.”
Sudan’s rich natural environment is impacted by the lack of strong protected areas, both at a policy level and operationally, and limited livelihood options for those living nearby. Project initiatives will enhance key sites, addressing environmental degradation and creating economic opportunities.
Within the parks, biodiversity will be supported via a range of targeted activities, including: consultative demarcation of park boundaries and buffer zones with communities; rehabilitation of selected wetland sites, mangroves and other areas; creation of wildlife corridors; efforts to address invasive species; and expanded monitoring of protected areas. Complementing this will be upgrades to park equipment and facilities.
Efforts to develop economic opportunities will include ecotourism – establishing tourism infrastructure and working with operators on eco-friendly activities – and expanding livelihood opportunities for the 62 communities inside and adjacent to the parks.
“This project and other interventions linked to it emphasise sustainable livelihoods and the ability of people to earn a living from the land in a sustainable way, while protecting Sudan’s natural resources,” said Yuri Afanasiev, UNDP Resident Representative in Sudan. “We hope this will contribute to the Government’s additional efforts supporting recovery in Sudan.”
At a national level, assistance will include training with international experts for national conservation and environmental agency staff, and financial support to meet international UNESCO-conservation guidelines, improve management of the national parks system, and develop a parks tourism strategy and other national policies.
Highlighting the expected impact, Prof.  Rashid Meky, Secretary-General of HCENR, said: “This is a long journey starting today as we take the first steps in this five-year programme. We look forward to increasing the collaboration we have always enjoyed with UNDP and partners - this is an important opportunity for the Government and the people of Sudan.”
The project involves contributions from a range of agencies and partners, including: the Ministry of Finance and National Economy, HCENR, GEF, UNDP, the Wildlife Conservation General Administration, the Range and Pasture General Directorate (RPGD), the Agriculture Research Corporation (ARC), the Sudanese Development Initiative (SUDIA), the Wildlife Research Centre, the Sudanese Environment Conservation Society (SECS), and UNESCO.

Title: Statement by the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sudan on the Outbreak of Violence in Al Geneina, West Darfur
Content: 06 April 2021
To date, at least 40 people have been killed, 58 injured and thousands of civilians displaced from their homes.
On the evening of 3 April, unknown men shot at Massalit tribesmen who were heading into Al Geneina Town, West Darfur state, killing two and injuring two others. Tensions between the Massalit and Arab tribes rapidly escalated and violent clashes commenced. To date, at least 40 people have been killed, 58 injured and thousands of civilians displaced from their homes. There were also reports of attacks on civilians, including women and children, and on humanitarian facilities.
The Special Representative to the Secretary-General for Sudan welcomes the decision by the Security and Defence Council on April 5 to declare a State of Emergency to contain the situation and urges Government security forces to prevent further violence and restore order in the interest of all civilians. These security forces should be seen to act in the interest of peace and to protect all civilians, in full compliance of international human rights standards and regardless of tribal or ethnic affiliations.
“I appeal to all parties to immediately stop fighting and call on the Government to ensure safety and access to humanitarian organizations providing services to those affected. The Government should investigate and hold accountable those responsible for the violence”, said SRSG Perthes. “The UN is committed to support the Government of Sudan in fulfilling its responsibility to protect civilians and in addressing the underlying causes of this continuing violence.
In contact with the Prime Minister, Members of Government and peace partners to the Juba Peace Agreement, SRSG Perthes conveyed that the UN and its humanitarian partners are mobilizing additional staff and resources to respond to the displacement and growing humanitarian needs from this latest round of violence.  An outbreak of violence in mid-January in Al Geneina led to hundreds of casualties, and the displacement of 108,000 already internally displaced persons from the Krinding camps.
The SRSG expresses his condolences to the families of the victims and wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured.

Statement attributable to the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - on Sudan
The Secretary-General condemns the looting of the first site, Saraf Umrah in Darfur, handed over to the Sudanese authorities following the end of the UNAMID mandate in December 2020.  At a time when community needs in Sudan are increasingly pressing, the site was intended to serve as a vocational training centre; unknown assailants have dashed that opportunity.
The Secretary-General calls on the Sudanese authorities to investigate the incident and ensure sufficient security presences for subsequent handovers so that facilities are preserved for civilian use.

Title: Launch of the UN-EU Counter-Terrorism Partnership for Sudan

The United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and the National Commission for Counter-Terrorism launch the UN-EU Counter-Terrorism Partnership for Sudan
Khartoum and New York  - Today, the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT)b and the Sudan, through its National Commission for Counter-Terrorism (SNCCT), launched the UN-EU Counter-Terrorism Partnership for Sudan, and held within this framework its first capacity-building activity focused on countering the financing of terrorism.
The event was opened by Ambassador Mr. Sayed Altyeb, Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who extended thanks and appreciation to UNOCT and the European Union for developing and financing this constructive program. “There is no doubt that the noble goals that this program seeks to achieve, are completely in the context of the efforts adopted by the Sudanese government aimed at raising awareness, building knowledge and providing support to combat terrorism, and developing strategies and programs that transform these hopes into reality,” he added.
In a video message addressed to participants, Mr. Vladimir Voronkov, Under-Secretary-General of UNOCT stressed “the excellent cooperation we have developed with Sudan’s National Commission for Counter-Terrorism,” and that “it is only appropriate that our project’s first capacity-building workshop focuses on countering the financing of terrorism, a key priority for the international counter-terrorism agenda.”
Mr. Daniel Weiss, Deputy Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Sudan indicated that “Countering the financing of terrorism remains a high priority for the European Union as the EU’s leaders declared it last November. Thus, the EU is delighted to support this workshop under the “UN-EU Counter-Terrorism Partnership for Sudan” project, implemented by the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism. It’s important to highlight that this project - worth well over 1 million dollars, will also make sure that the respect for human dignity and human rights and the rule of law is intertwined in all counter-terrorism measures in Sudan.”
The opening session was also attended by senior officials from the government of Sudan, senior representatives from the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) and the UN Country Team as well as the diplomatic community.
The workshop, held today and tomorrow in Khartoum, aims at strengthening the capacity of Sudanese authorities to counter the financing of terrorism by addressing the international countering terrorist financing framework, respect of human rights in counter-terrorism, regional risks and vulnerabilities and the importance of public-private partnerships. It is organized with the Global Programme on Countering the Financing of Terrorism in the UN Counter-Terrorism Centre (UNCCT) within UNOCT.
This workshop is the first of a series of thematic trainings to be delivered under the UN-EU Counter-Terrorism Partnership for Sudan, an initiative funded by the European Union and aimed at strengthening the capacity of Sudan’s authorities to prevent and counter terrorism, in compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law. Within this framework, UNOCT is providing and mobilizing capacity building support to address technical assistance needs jointly identified with Sudanese authorities in areas such as legislative assistance, border security and management and upholding human rights while countering terrorism.

Title: UN experts call for enhanced protection of civilians, including internally displaced, in Darfur
Content: 01 February 2021
Sudan must urgently implement strong measures to ensure the safety of civilians
GENEVA  – UN experts said today Sudan must urgently implement strong measures to ensure the safety of civilians, including the internally displaced, and thoroughly investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of recent deadly intercommunal violence and attacks in Darfur.
On 16 and 17 January, intercommunal violence leading to clashes between Arab nomads and the non-Arab ethnic Masalit in West Darfur affecting the Krinding and Abu Zar camps for internally displaced persons reportedly killed 163 people, injured 217 and displaced 50,000 people. Civilian property was damaged and looted.
On 18 January, clashes between the Rezigat and Falata communities in El Gereida locality, in South Darfur, reportedly resulted in the killing of 72 people. More than 70 were injured and about 100 families displaced.
“We urge the Government of Sudan to step up its efforts to protect civilians, including those internally displaced, prevent further displacements and advance solutions to internal displacement by promptly and fully implementing its National Plan for the Protection of Civilians,” the experts said.
While welcoming the establishment of a committee to investigate the recent West Darfur attacks, the experts urged the Government to also investigate the violence in South Darfur, as well as past incidents.
“Justice, accountability and reparation to victims are essential to address insecurity, prevent further violence and displacement, and support durable solutions for internally displaced persons,” they said.
The experts also said they were gravely concerned for the internally displaced persons in the Darfur region, particularly the long-term displaced.
“Many have been living in protracted displacement in dire conditions, and the challenges they face to achieve durable solutions, in particular due to insecurity and land disputes, are disturbing,” the experts said.
The independent experts are in contact with the authorities.

Title: Sudan launches first-ever State of the Environment and Outlook report to help guide peace and sustainable development
Content: 07 October 2020
The Government of Sudan and UNEP launch the first-ever State of the Environment and Outlook Report for the Republic of Sudan under the theme of Environment for Peace and Sustainable Development
Khartoum - The Government of Sudan and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) today jointly launched the first-ever State of the Environment and Outlook Report for the Republic of Sudan under the theme of Environment for Peace and Sustainable Development.
This report’s launch comes as Sudan works to improve its political and economic systems to further economic and social progress following the country’s historical revolution and the 3 October 2020 signing of a peace agreement. Sudan’s efforts to rebuild present a fresh opportunity to ensure that environmental concerns are factored into the country's transition to freedom, justice, peace and growth.
"The theme of this report – Environment for Peace and Sustainable Development – is aptly chosen not only because it highlights the intricate nature of the nexus between environment, peace and sustainable development, but also because it comes at a time when the new Sudan seeks peaceful rebuilding of the nation, the establishment of a vibrant economy, and a politically stable future under the emblem of the December 2019 Revolution: Freedom, Peace, and Justice," said Prime Minister of Sudan Dr. Abdalla Hamdok. “Sudan aspires to utilise its rich natural resources for the welfare of its current and future generations.”
The State of the Environment and Outlook Report comprises ten comprehensive chapters with facts and figures on the state and trend of the environment of Sudan from 2011 to 2020.  The report also contains an outlook section which provides an environmental vision to which the country can aspire in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The report highlights the following needs:
“Sudan is in the midst of a very significant political transition to a more inclusive and peaceful future. In addition, like countries around the world, Sudan is struggling to to recover in the face of the economic crisis and the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Environmental sustainability, coupled with inclusion, lie at the heart of the country’s efforts to grow economically, because natural resources are the foundation of its agriculture-dominated economy,” said UNEP’s Executive Director, Inger Andersen. “We hope this report will contribute to sound, environmentally sustainable growth and to Sudan’s overall transition.”
The report looks at Sudan’s specific environmental challenges in detail, covering a multitude of issues from deforestation and land degradation to waste management to food security. It provides detailed facts and figures collected from a broad spectrum of institutions, officials, experts and stakeholders.
For instance, the report warns that an almost 30% population increase by the year 2030, will lead to a substantial rise in the number of people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of food, water, housing, and other services. This could add more pressure on Sudan’s natural resources, causing significant environmental consequences.
The final chapter of the report explores policy options for a sustainable and peaceful future for Sudan. Two possible future scenarios depicted in the report – Business as Usual and Bending the Curve – demonstrate the differences between a future following the country’s current development path without intervention, and one following more sustainable environment conservation and better natural resources management.
Some of the report’s policy options include:
This report was produced under the UK-AID/UNEP Adapt for Environment and Climate Resilience in Sudan (ADAPT!) initiative, which aims to promote evidence-based policy and decision-making and scale up successful environmental practices in development and humanitarian programming.

The Mapping provides an easy way to visualize and filter SLF project data and it also tracks emerging hotspots, interlinkages, conflict triggers, and transhumance routes in the region
UNAMID and 10 UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes today launch the UN State Liaison Functions Data Mapping to support evidence-based decision making and data-driven planning and promote a greater understanding of the geographical coverage, range of activities and impact of State Liaison Functions projects jointly implemented by UNAMID and the UN Country Team.
The Mapping provides an easy way to visualize and filter SLF project data and it also tracks emerging hotspots, interlinkages, conflict triggers, and transhumance routes in the region.
The Mapping presently includes data from SLF Phase I (Jan. to June 2019) with other phases to be published in due course.
SLF projects contribute to addressing the prevention of relapse into conflict in Darfur over the long term by addressing immediate drivers of conflict, including competition over land, livestock, water and other scarce resources as well as IDP and refugee returns to areas with limited infrastructure, services and livelihood opportunities.
Ten UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes are involved in the SLF programme: FAO, IOM, UN-Habitat, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN Women, WHO and WFP.

He also thanks the Government of South Sudan and President Salva Kiir for their important role in facilitating the talks. The Secretary-General calls on the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement–North–Abdelaziz Al-Hilu and the Sudan Liberation Movement–Abdul Wahid Al-Nur to join the peace process.
The Secretary-General is fully committed to supporting the implementation of this agreement, which marks the start of a new era for the people of the Sudan and for people living in Darfur and the Two Areas, in particular. This will require sustained commitment and collaboration between the parties and the people of the Sudan. The United Nations, through UNITAMS and UNAMID, and in partnership with the African Union, will offer support, as requested by the parties and within its capacity and mandate, to the implementation of this and future peace agreements during the transition period. The United Nations will also support Sudanese stakeholders in longer-term peacebuilding efforts aimed at achieving accountability and consolidating peace and security gains.

Title: Statement attributed to Mr. Massimo Diana, Humanitarian Coordinator A.I. for Sudan, on World Humanitarian Day 2020
Content: 19 August 2020
On this World Humanitarian Day we pay tribute to aid workers who commit their lives to helping others
Khartoum, 19 August 2020. On this World Humanitarian Day we pay tribute to aid workers who commit their lives to helping others. This year we want to especially recognize the efforts of humanitarians –most of them Sudanese– who support their own communities during these extraordinary times. They are our real-life heroes. The conditions that aid workers face is unforgiving, and that was before the COVID-19 pandemic.
The novel coronavirus arrived when millions of Sudanese were already struggling to get food and shelter. More than 9 million people—nearly a quarter of Sudan’s population– need humanitarian assistance. Vulnerabilities of women and children increased as a result of COVID-19 and we use this day to redouble our commitment to help them navigate this pandemic.
Aid workers in Sudan are the young women heading a local peace-building project. The refugee nurse treating sick patients without supplies. And the father who moved away from his kids to protect civilians. To honor these people, we remind the parties in Sudan to follow International Humanitarian Law. Allowing aid workers to fulfill their roles is a direct contribution to the wellbeing of the people of Sudan.
Despite the challenges, and thanks to the support from our donors, we have helped more than 7 million people so far this year. Today we reiterate our commitment to the people of Sudan.
Your kindness despite years of hardship inspires us. And we honor the humanitarian workers and front-line responders who create a better Sudan.
Note:
This year’s World Humanitarian Day campaign is featuring the work of front-line responders across the world who are doing extraordinary things, during extraordinary times, to save lives. Join the campaign by going to http://www.worldhumanitarianday.org and sharing the messages.

Title: Statement attributable to the Spokesman for the Secretary-General - on Sudan
Content: 29 July 2020
United Nations Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the increasing violence in many parts of the Darfur region of Sudan
The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the increasing violence in many parts of the Darfur region of Sudan, notably the attacks in West Darfur on 25 July and in North Darfur on 13 July, in which dozens of people were killed and more than 1,500 houses burned, leaving thousands displaced and in dire need of humanitarian assistance.
The Secretary-General commends the efforts by the Sudanese authorities, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abdala Hamdok, in responding to these incidents, and calls for an investigation to ensure accountability.  Deliberate attacks against civilians violate international human rights law and international humanitarian law. The Secretary-General reiterates the commitment of the United Nations to support the implementation of the national protection strategy developed recently by the Transitional Government.  The African Union-United Nations Hybrid Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) will continue to focus on its protection mandate, and humanitarian partners continue to provide emergency relief.
The Secretary-General urges all armed groups, particularly those that have not joined the ongoing peace talks in Juba, to resolve their grievances through a political process.  As Sudan continues its process of democratic transition, there is a clear imperative to end the conflict in Darfur with a definitive and inclusive peace agreement.

Content: 25 June 2020
To sustain the momentum and make the political and economic transition a success, the High-Level Sudan Partnership Conference, today gathered around 50 countries and international organisations.
Sudan is at a historic turning point: On its way to peace and democracy, many challenges lie ahead. To sustain the momentum and make the political and economic transition a success, the High-Level Sudan Partnership Conference, today gathered around 50 countries and international organisations.
During the conference, the participants took stock of the achievements of the Sudanese transition so far, and discussed the challenges ahead. Building on the progress made by the Transitional Government in putting in place political and economic reforms, a strong political consensus emerged to support Sudan and its transition in building peace, democratic governance and inclusive economic recovery as well as in progressing towards debt relief.
Participating delegations agreed on a Joint Communiqué, which underlines the necessity of this political partnership and economic support as well as outlines the way forward to support Sudan in its transition.
To support Sudan’s economic reforms and mitigate their social impact on its population, international partners pledged a total of USD 1.8 billion, to which the World Bank committed to providing an additional pre-arrears clearance grant of up to USD 400m. This includes support to improving macro-economic stabilisation and the Sudan Family Support Program, which will provide vital assistance to millions of vulnerable people, direct help to enhance Sudan’s capacity to respond to COVID-19, and more generally, humanitarian assistance and development cooperation.
This Conference marks the start of a process, which will be followed by subsequent engagement by the international community to take stock of the progress made by Sudan in implementing reforms and to allow its partners to adapt their support accordingly.

Title: United Nations welcomes the launch of Sudan National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security
Content: 11 June 2020
The adoption of the National Action Plan is an important milestone in the ongoing political transition as it fulfils one of the key commitments in the Constitutional Declaration to “apply UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the relevant African Union resolutions regarding participation of women at all levels in the peace process


PRESS STATEMENT
Khartoum, 11 June 2020 -- The UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son, congratulates the government and people of Sudan on the adoption of a National Action Plan for the Implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women peace and security (NAP 1325) on June 10, 2020.
Ms Son stated that, “The adoption of the National Action Plan is an important milestone in the ongoing political transition as it fulfils one of the key commitments in the Constitutional Declaration to “apply UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the relevant African Union resolutions regarding participation of women at all levels in the peace process.”
The Country Representative of UN Women in Sudan, Ms Adjaratou Fatou Ndiaye, equally applauds the adoption of the National Action Plan and by the government of Sudan and acknowledged that through their commitment and dedication to gender equality and women’s empowerment, the Ministry of Labour and Social Development has spearheaded this amongst other achievements during the short time of its establishment in the new dispensation. She committed in line with UN Women mandate to support the Government to implement an operational plan focused on measurable indicators to showcase the impact of the implementation of the UNSCR 1325 action plan on the realization of peace in Sudan.
Ms Son further observed, “Sudan is emerging from three decades of dictatorship and conflict, during which fundamental human rights were largely eroded and women and girls specifically, were subjected to systematic violence, marginalized from political decision-making and suffered myriad social economic and disadvantages. The transitional government has made some progress in commitments to gender equality and women's empowerment. For example, appointment of women to ministerial and other senior leadership positions, signature of a framework for cooperation on conflict related sexual violence and abolition of gender discriminatory laws (e.g. repeals of the Public Order Act and the FGM provision in the Criminal Code). However, the future of democracy in the country will depend on how the transition includes the voices and perspectives of all members of society, especially women and girls in all political and peace processes, observance of human rights and the existence of enabling environment for all citizens to participate in the economy. The National Action Plan on Women Peace and security offers a road map to how women can take their rightful position in these developments and the United Nations in Sudan is committed to support the government and people of Sudan towards these aims.”

Content: 03 June 2020
Together, we have witnessed an inspiring time of peaceful protests that reflected the courage and determination of the Sudanese people including women and children, and together we can witness the realization of freedom, peace and justice.
One year ago, the world witnessed brutal attacks on pro-democracy protesters in Sudan.
On behalf of the United Nations Country Team in Sudan, I reiterate the United Nations Secretary General’s call to the authorities to credibly and independently investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the reported violations of human rights.
The establishment of the National Independent Investigation Committee by the Transitional Government to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed on 3 June and other related incidents, last September 2019, is a crucial step toward justice and accountability.
Our thoughts and prayers remain with all who were tragically lost, and the families and friends who suffered.
Together, we have witnessed an inspiring time of peaceful protests that reflected the courage and determination of the Sudanese people including women and children, and together we can witness the realization of freedom, peace and justice.
Today, I reiterate the firm commitment of the United Nations to support Sudan’s transition, as it moves toward achieving the long-standing aspirations of its people for peace and democracy.

Title: SUDAN GOVERNMENT AND WFP SIGN AGREEMENT ON SUDAN FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMME
Content: 29 May 2020
The Government of Sudan and WFP have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to support the government’s Family Support program that will provide Sudanese families direct cash transfers
KHARTOUM – The Government of Sudan and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to support the government’s Family Support program that will provide Sudanese families direct cash transfers.
The Sudanese Minister of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) Dr. Ibrahim Elbadawi and WFP Sudan’s Representative and Country Director Hameed Nuru today signed the MoU in the presence of Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok and the WFP Executive Director David Beasley.
Under the Sudan Family Support Programme, the Sudanese Government will provide direct cash transfers each month to support vulnerable families as part of its efforts to mitigate the effects of the ongoing economic difficulties. The multi-ministerial programme, led by the MoFEP, is expected to start in the second half of the year with financing from the Government of Sudan and partners.
“The Family Support Programme is one of the Transitional Government’s greatest undertakings and will be a major dividend of the December Revolution. It will provide direct cash transfers to around 80 percent of Sudanese families to support them through the challenging economic circumstances currently facing Sudan,” Minister Elbadawi stated.
The Government of Sudan estimates that 65 percent of the population live below the poverty line. The already dire food security situation is likely to worsen with the adverse socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, with the closure of nonessential businesses, coupled with rapidly rising food prices.
“The programme will be key to safeguarding people at risk of slipping into extreme poverty,” said Nuru. “Our steady partnership with donors like United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is what enables us to provide critical assistance. We are grateful to have such generous partners.”
According to the MoU, WFP will support the Government to develop a cash transfer delivery and payments system, and a complaints and feedback mechanism – including a call centre – to support recipients of the programme.
“The platform developed for the Sudan Family Support Programme will allow efficient and accountable digital delivery of a broad range of social protection and other Government services to the People of Sudan,” said Nuru.

Title: UNHCR condemns “senseless” attack on South Sudanese refugees in West Kordofan leading to new displacement
Content: 17 May 2020
The UN Refugee Agency is shocked over senseless, violent assaults on a refugee settlement in Al Meiram, West Kordofan, earlier this month, causing some 400 South Sudanese refugees to flee north until 17 May
Sudan - UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is shocked over senseless, violent assaults on a refugee settlement in Al Meiram, West Kordofan, earlier this month, causing some 400 South Sudanese refugees to flee north until this Sunday (17 May).
The assaults started on May 5, when the settlement was raided by tribesmen on horsebacks causing panic and destruction. Over 200 of the nearly 280 houses in the settlement were burned to the ground, all their belongings destroyed or robbed, including important identity documents when the tribesmen injured 18 refugees. The attackers claim the assaults were intended as a revenge linked to intercommunal clashes in the Abiye region where armed attacks flared between different communities in recent weeks.  “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this brutal attack on innocent men, women and children,” UNHCR’s Representative a.i., Elizabeth Tan, said in a statement.
Refugees shared their ordeal with UNHCR staff. “Everything I built and gathered in years was gone in a moment,” a former businessman and father of 9 told the Agency. “I am happy that nobody was killed.”
The refugees fled to a military compound where they received protection, food and water. After two days some returned to the remains of the settlement - torched earth -, wary about any new violence.
Until Sunday (17 May), over 80 families, around 400 individuals, decided to leave the area and travelled north to parts of West Kordofan where some of them used to work in the harvest season: El Tboun, Ghubaish, Adella and El Majrur. Initial reports indicate that they do not intend to return to Al Meiram after the harvest because of the threats and violence.
Immediately after the assaults, UNHCR supported the families in the damaged settlement with plastic sheeting, kitchen sets and blankets. The Agency is now monitoring the situation and the movements. “It will be vital to restore safety and security quickly and to bring perpetrators to justice”, said Tan. “UNHCR stands ready to work with the government and the humanitarian community to address the urgent needs of these people who felt compelled to move on.” Authorities proposed a plot of land where an alternative settlement could be established.
The UNHCR Representative also praised the solidarity of the Sudanese neighbours in Al Meiram: “They rejected violence, protected the refugee community and prevented attacks where they could, and opened their homes to those who had lost everything”. The host community offered 100,000 Sudanese Pound (some US$ 1,800, according to the official exchange rate) in an act of solidarity with the refugees to help rebuild their houses.
Sudan hosts some 821,000 South Sudanese refugees, including about 61,000 in West Kordofan. UNHCR’s work in West Kordofan focuses on protection and supports both refugees and their host communities in places like Al Meiram where the Agency distributed mosquito nets to both groups recently.

Title: Untold suffering awaits Sudan unless it receives a helping hand – Bachelet
Content: 28 April 2020
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet expressed serious concerns about the crisis facing Sudan’s transition in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
GENEVA – The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday expressed serious concerns about the crisis facing Sudan’s transition in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that untold suffering awaits unless donors act fast.
Barely a year after the removal from power of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir, Bachelet said the promise of economic and social development, democracy, justice and peace is now being threatened by acute resource constraints on the Transitional  Government of Sudan. These are being exacerbated by a combination of the practical effects of ongoing unilateral sanctions, the failure of international institutions to provide debt-relief, and a deficit of international support.
“The tipping point,” the UN Human Rights Chief said, “could be COVID-19.”
Medical sources have warned there is a serious shortage of equipment and protective gear. As of 27 April, 275 people had been tested positive with COVID-19, 22 of whom have died.
“The health system is simply not equipped to handle an outbreak on the scale we have seen elsewhere in the world. There is only one way to prevent a humanitarian disaster, and that is for the donors to step up and extend a helping hand to Sudan,” said Bachelet.
“We must act swiftly and generously to provide financial support. Otherwise, we run the risk of a country which held such promise relapsing back into political instability and potential conflict.”
In a letter to the UN Secretary-General on 8 April 2020, Sudan’s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok acknowledged that COVID-19 poses profound challenges to his country’s health system, economy, and society as a whole, and he sought financial and other technical support to tackle the pandemic.
Of Sudan’s population of 43 million people, nearly 2 million remain internally displaced as a result of conflicts in Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile state. Most face dire conditions, living in camps or settlements, unable to meet their basic needs. Sudan also hosts more than 1.1 million refugees and migrants.
Even before the arrival of COVID-19, many Sudanese were battling to make ends meet due to high unemployment, soaring inflation, and lack of social protection and safety nets. These issues have been compounded by the effects of Sudan still being on the US list of States sponsoring terrorism. In addition, Sudan is currently among the countries not eligible to access the US$50-billion Trust Fund of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to assist countries to fight COVID-19.
Separately, the UN Secretary-General has urged the international community to do all it can to support the country in its transition, and during this time of serious need.
“The only way Sudan will ever be able to break out of this cycle of poverty and desperation is to be freed from the impediments of sanctions imposed at the time of the previous government. This would enable Sudan to attract investment for its much-needed economic reforms, and to fully access funds of the international financial institutions,” said Bachelet.
“Inequality, and economic and social grievances, were the main triggers of Sudan’s revolution last year. If these and other root causes are not addressed as a matter of priority, Sudan’s successful transition to achieving a durable peace remains distant.”

Title: UN: COVID-19 response in Sudan requires coordination so lifesaving aid can continue
Content: 07 April 2020
23 UN organizations call on Sudan’s government to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance in Sudan to the most vulnerable people in Sudan, including to contain, test and treat COVID-19
KHARTOUM -- Amid the largest global challenge since World War II, 23 UN organizations call on Sudan’s government to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance in Sudan to the most vulnerable people in Sudan, including to contain, test and treat COVID-19. UN and partners reached over 7 million people in need in 2019.  We plan to reach 6.1 million people in need in 2020.
“If not properly coordinated, aid delivery may be delayed or fail to go ahead as a consequence of COVID-19,” said Gwi Yeop Son, the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan. “The United Nations is staying and delivering assistance in Sudan.”
As of April 7 there are 14 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Sudan with the chance that case numbers will rapidly increase.
Specifically, the UN cited three areas it needed to coordinate with Sudan’s government on:
“Already, the United Nations is coordinating with Sudan’s government in some of these areas. But as COVID-19 spreads in Sudan, we need to ensure this cooperation continues so lifesaving operations can reach people in need.”
Across Sudan, about 9.3 million people require humanitarian support in 2020. The United Nations humanitarian plan in Sudan is only 14 percent funded.

Title: Sudan: Spread facts, not fear, in the fight against COVID-19
Content: 01 April 2020
Misinformation, rumors and myths can be as deadly as COVID-19. During a pandemic, sharing accurate information – and stopping the spread of misinformation – can save lives.
PRESS NOTE
KHARTOUM -- As coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads globally, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), United Nations in Sudan and other partners are calling for members of the public to share facts, verified health advice, and official information to help combat the disease.
Misinformation, rumors and myths can be as deadly as COVID-19. During a pandemic, sharing accurate information – and stopping the spread of misinformation – can save lives.
We call on all Sudanese to do their part, and spread facts not fear in the fight against COVID-19. Combating fake or misleading information about the virus is an individual and collective responsibility.
Despite significant sharing of facts, verified health advice and effective protection measures from credible sources, misleading information is being widely shared by the public, particularly on social media and messaging platforms. Additionally, incorrect health information claiming to be from UN agencies has appeared online.
False information about the virus, misleading myths about cures, and incorrect health advice can have devastating consequences.
Four steps are recommended for members of the public to help stop the spread of misinformation:
Use only credible, official sources such as the Ministry of Health, WHO and UNICEF
Check the facts on official websites or social media platforms before acting, believing advice or sharing information online
Don’t spread misinformation, even if it seems accurate
Help authorities get real advice out, share official materials
To support national efforts to control the spread of the virus, the UN in Sudan will continue to distribute critical information to the Sudanese public while adhering to the principles of physical distancing and avoiding large gatherings. Additionally, the UN will regularly share guidelines and recommendations with health authorities at the federal and state levels.

Title: Statement by Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son, the Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, calling for ceasefire across Sudan
Content: 29 March 2020
The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan calls for a ceasefire across Sudan as part of a global fight against coronavirus pandemic.
Khartoum -- The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Gwi-Yeop Son, calls for a ceasefire across Sudan as part of a global fight against coronavirus pandemic. “It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown, pull back from hostilities and focus together on saving lives,” Ms. Son said.
“Let’s not forget that in conflict-affected areas health services have been affected the worst. Therefore, it is crucial to create corridors for life-saving aid and open precious windows for diplomacy and ultimate peace,” Ms. Son added.
Last week, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres appealed for global ceasefire while the world faces a common enemy: COVID-19. “I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives,” the UN Secretary-General said.
The health system in Sudan has been affected by years of under-investment and economic crisis. Only one third of health facilities offer a complete basic package of care. Health facilities are understaffed and underequipped to cope with large-scale outbreaks, and there are significant shortages of essential medicines, according to the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19.
While armed conflict between the Government of Sudan and most of armed movements has reduced following unilateral cessations of hostilities over the recent years, there have been occasional flare-ups in parts of the Jebel Marra area in Darfur.

Title: UN strongly condemns the harassment of humanitarian staff and looting of humanitarian premises in North Darfur
Content: 23 January 2020
UN calls on the federal and state government authorities to thoroughly investigate the recent harassment of UN and NGO staff and subsequent looting and vandalization of UN and NGO premises and assets in Kabkabiya, North Darfur and bring all persons responsible for these unwarranted actions to book
Zalingei/Khartoum - “This emerging trend of harassment of UN and NGO staff and subsequent looting and vandalization of UN and NGO premises and assets is not only very disturbing but totally uncalled for. UN and NGO staff are in Darfur to provide critical humanitarian and peacekeeping support in the region and deserve the full support and appreciation from the communities they serve,” UNAMID’s Joint Special Representative/Joint Chief Mediator, Jeremiah Mamabolo stated in response to reports received about the wanton destruction of property in Kabkabiya, North Darfur.
On 22 January, a large crowd of men, women and children harassed staff from the International Organization of Migration (IOM) who were on mission to distribute non-food items to victims of flooding that occurred in Kabkabiya, North Darfur last October. The distribution commenced on 20 January at the premises of an implementing partner and was supposed to conclude on 22 January. However, towards the end of the distribution program, some looters attacked the IOM staff alleging that they were not included in the distribution matrix. It was later reported that the premises of five other local NGOs were also looted.
Later in the day, government security forces intervened whilst UNAMID’s Pakistan Contingent based in the area, also secured the World Food Programme (WFP) premises and four local staff remaining in the offices.
“We appeal to both federal and state government authorities to thoroughly investigate above incidents and bring all persons responsible for these unwarranted actions to book,” JSR Mamabolo added.
The Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Gwi-Yeop Son, condemned the attacks on humanitarian offices, assets and looting of humanitarian supplies in Kabkabiya, North Darfur.
“I condemn these acts and call upon the Government authorities to launch a swift investigation and bring those responsible to account,” Ms. Son said. “Attacks against humanitarian actors and operations endanger lives, violate the protection of civilians, including humanitarian workers, under international humanitarian law, and jeopardize the provision of life-saving aid to people in need.”
Over the past year there were several other incidents of looting of humanitarian supplies in Darfur.
UNAMID continues to monitor the situation and will take taking appropriate measures to continue to facilitate humanitarian access in Darfur, in line with its protection of civilians’ responsibilities as mandated by the United Nations Security Council.

Title: Mine clearance operations urgently needed in South Kordofan, Blue Nile and Jebel Marra
Content: 21 January 2020
Mine Action Support Group (MASG) meeting of the year highlighted the urgent need for mine clearance operations in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states and the Jebel Marrah area
Khartoum - The first Mine Action Support Group (MASG) meeting of the year, convened in Khartoum on 19 January, highlighted the urgent need for mine clearance operations in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states and the Jebel Marrah area in Darfur in opening humanitarian corridors to enable humanitarian aid delivery to the opposition-controlled areas.
The meeting was co-chaired by the German Ambassador H.E. Ullrich Klöckner and the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC) Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son and addressed by the Minister of Defence H.E. Lt. Gen Jamal Al-din Omar.
Keynote speakers included the United States Chargé d’affaires H.E. Brian Shukan, UNMAS Chief of Programmes Mr. Paul Heslop and UNMAS Sudan Programme Manager Mr. Sediq Rashid. The meeting was attended by ambassadors of the United Kingdom and Japan and representatives from Switzerland, Italy, Norway, UK Department for International Development, United States Agency for International Development and National Mine Action Center.
“Cross-line humanitarian aid delivery is five times cheaper than that through the cross-border” said Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son.
The German Ambassador H.E. Ullrich Klöckner, the new chair of the MASG platform, congratulated the United States for successfully completing its chairmanship of the MASG in the last two years and affirmed his support to mine action. “Germany is committed to mine action and I saw its impact in opening humanitarian access and development in Zimbabwe and Mozambique,” he said.
The US Chargé d’affaires H.E. Brian Shukan explained the achievements during his tenure as MASG chair, including doubling US contribution to UNMAS. He further expressed continuous US support for Sudan until it meets Ottawa treaty obligations by 2023. “US encourages all the parties to end the conflict and allow clearance of mines and explosive ordnance,” he added.
UNMAS Sudan Programme Manager Sediq Rashid explained mine action needs in the Two Areas and Jebel Marra. He stated that “there are 350 km of roads in South Kordofan and 200km of roads in Blue Nile that need to be cleared to enable humanitarian assistance to SPLM-N controlled areas”.
UNMAS Chief of Programmes Mr. Paul Heslop congratulated Sudan on its presidency of the 18th Meeting of States Parties to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and thanked mine action donors namely Japan, Italy, US and UK’s DFID for the progress made so far, including completion of clearing all known explosive ordnance in the Eastern states. With the progress in peace talks in Juba, “UNMAS is ready for emergency mine action response to bring humanitarian assistance and immediate peace dividends to South Kordofan, Blue Nile and Jebel Marra”. Mr. Heslop further added that “while opening the Kadugli – Kauda road will need 5 million USD, doing so will mean the logistics costs of humanitarian assistance in the area will diminish by a factor of 10”.
The Minister of Defence H.E. Lt. Gen Jamal Al-din Omar thanked the donor community and the United Nations for their support to Sudan and highlighted the government’s commitment towards mine action and its obligations under the Ottawa treaty. “Intervention of mine action at this critical stage is so crucial and an overriding priority as it will strongly boost the ongoing process of building peace”, the Minister added while requesting donors to come onboard to support Sudan’s mine action needs.

Title: Transitional Government signs USD 20 million programme with the United Nations Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund
Content: 21 December 2019
The Government of Sudan signed a USD 20 million programme with the United Nations Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund, aimed at supporting the transitional authorities
Khartoum – On 18 December, the Government of Sudan signed a USD 20 million programme with the United Nations Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund, aimed at supporting the transitional authorities.
The signature of the peacebuilding package comes pursuant to a request, by the Prime Minister of Sudan, H. E. Abdallah Hamdok on 25 September that Sudan be declared eligible for the Peacebuilding Fund and that first-phase Funding be made immediately available in the three priority areas identified for Darfur, namely Rule of Law; Durable Solutions and Peacebuilding at the Community level.
“Peace is of utmost importance to the transitional government and it is the main indicator for the success of this glorious revolution. We are committed to creating effective partnerships that help in creating an enabling environment for sustainable peace and for the long-awaited stability of Sudan and its people,” the Prime Minister said.
In making the request, the Prime Minister underscored that his first and most immediate priority was to end the war and build a sustainable peace and that, as the UNAMID peacekeeping mission reduced its presence in Darfur, it is of utmost importance that a responsible transition take place.
The Prime Minister outlined his government’s expectation that the Peace Commission would be at the helm of all peacebuilding efforts in Darfur.
On 16 October 2019, the Secretary-General of the United Nations declared the Sudan eligible for support from the fund for a period of five years.
The Secretary General noted that further resources could also be made available to support national peace process as required in accordance with specific needs identified by the Government.
He further invited the Prime Minister to present transition priorities and peacebuilding strategy to the Peacebuilding Commission, an intergovernmental advisory body jointly established by the General Assembly and the Security Council in 2005 to support peace efforts in countries emerging from conflict.
Peacebuilding projects will take place to support the Government of Sudan’s efforts to build peace in Darfur by addressing land issues, the root cause and driver of much of the conflict, and to rebuild the social contract with and between all elements of the population.
The programme package builds on a series of consultations, at the state and locality levels in Darfur, conducted together state-level government and community representatives.
The two-tier consultations took place in May-June and August-September 2019 with participation of the Darfur Governors’ offices, as well as key line ministries. Representatives from the Darfur Land Commission, the Humanitarian Aid Commission, the Voluntary Return and Reintegration Commission (VRRC) and the Peace and Research Centres besides representatives from local communities, youth and women’s groups, IDPs and nomadic groups had also took part in the consultations.
The United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son stated that “development of the five projects has been fully coordinated and aligned with state government plans. State governments co-hosted the stakeholder consultations which identified the geographic location for programmes and determined where the fund could be fully spent in averting conflict.”

Title: WFP Executive Director in breakthrough visit to Yabus in the Blue Nile State following decade of inaccessibility
Content: 18 December 2019
WFP Executive Director, David Beasley, accompanied by teams from WFP’s Sudan and South Sudan operations and leaders of the UN Country Team in Sudan have achieved a significant breakthrough in humanitarian access, by landing in Yabus, Blue Nile State.
Khartoum, Sudan – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director, David Beasley, accompanied by teams from WFP’s Sudan and South Sudan operations and leaders of the UN Country Team in Sudan have achieved a significant breakthrough in humanitarian access, by landing in Yabus, a town in the Southern Blue Nile State where they witnessed a food distribution to its war and flood-stricken residents for the first time in nearly a decade.
The UN team included the United Nations Children’s Fund, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, World Health Organisation, United Nations Population Fund and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from Sudan.
Parts of southern Blue Nile State have been inaccessible to UN agencies and most humanitarian groups since conflict began there and in the Nuba mountains of South Kordofan in May 2011.
In October, Beasley used his good offices to support a humanitarian confidence-building visit to Kauda in South Kordofan – the first UN visit to the area in nearly a decade. This followed months of negotiations with the new Government of Sudan, leaders of South Sudan and the Sudan People Liberation Movement North (SPLM-N) leader, Abdulaziz Al-Hilu. Following this visit, commitments were made to enable humanitarian access to the conflict-affected areas of Blue Nile and South Kordofan.
“This is a new day in a new Sudan and a government that recognizes the value and the dignity of the Sudanese people wherever they live and whoever they are,” said David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme. “We will be doing assessments in all the areas that need assistance over the next few months to help everyone who needs this help at this critical time.”
The first UN humanitarian assistance in the area in nearly a decade was distributed by a WFP-led, UN interagency team. The UN team provided food to nearly 10,000 people in Yabus. This was made possible through the work of UN staff from Sudan and cross border assistance from South Sudan. The United Nations humanitarian agencies in Sudan will move forward together to provide sustained assistance to address food security, health, education and livestock health deficits in the area.
Yabus and some areas in the Blue Nile State were recently affected by floods, pests and diseases resulting in low farm harvests leaving many of its residents in food deficit.
The support we have received from Prime Minister, Abdalla Hamdok, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan “Hemeti” Dagalo, Chairman of the Sovereign Council, Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan and Cdr. Abdul Aziz Adam al-Hilu, Chairman and C-in-C of the SPLM/A-N has been extraordinary.
Sudan’s economic crisis is affecting living conditions and pushing more people into poverty. Nearly 9.3 million people – one in four in Sudan – will need humanitarian assistance in 2020. Around 5.8 million people are food-insecure. That number could rise to more than 10 million if wheat and fuel subsidies are removed. The cost of food has more than doubled in the past year.
WFP and its partners are ready to address rising humanitarian needs, while helping strengthen social protection systems to respond to the challenging economic situation and reduce the impact of planned subsidy reforms. WFP supports internally displaced people, refugees, and vulnerable people through a mixture of cash, food and vouchers. More robust social safety nets are needed to cushion them against the impact of macro-economic reforms.
Additional funding is needed to enable WFP to meet the increasing humanitarian needs across Sudan. WFP Sudan faces a funding shortfall of US$29 million for the next six months. This may increase, given the rising humanitarian needs.

Khartoum -- The United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Ms. Gwi-Yeop Son congratulates the people of Sudan and the Transitional Government for the election of the country as chair of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production, and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, also known as Ottawa Treaty, during the 4th Review Conference of the Convention held in Oslo from 25 to 29 November 2019 attended by 164 Member States, UN agencies and civil societies.
Sudan will be responsible for promoting universal adherence to the convention while ensuring the implementation of the convention by the member states and the newly adopted Oslo Action Plan during its presidency in the coming 12 months. Additionally, Sudan will preside over the 18th Meeting of States Parties in November 2020 in Geneva.
During the review conference, H.E. Lt. Gen Jamal Aldin Omar, Minister of Defence, highlighted Sudan’s commitment towards the obligations under the Convention and appreciated support from the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), donor countries, Implementing Support Unit, INGOs and other mine action partners.
H.E. Osman Abufatima Adam Mohammed, Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative of Sudan to the United Nations in Geneva and the President of the Eighteenth Meeting of States Parties highlighted the six areas that Sudan will focus on during its presidency: universalization of the convention; stockpile destruction; demining; victim assistance; compliance with the convention; funding for the convention’s meetings, and implementation of Oslo Action Plan.
The Republic of Sudan has been a state party to the Ottawa Treaty since 2004, and met Article 4 obligations of destroying all stockpile of Anti-Personnel mines in March 2008. Sudan obtained the second extension to comply with its Article 5 obligations to clear all known landmines by April 2023.
“Thanks to strong coordination between the National Mine Action Centre and UNMAS, and generous contributions from multiple donor countries and Sudan, substantial achievement has been made to release 80 % out of the recorded land affected with explosive ordnance,” says Ms. Son.
“With this, South Kordofan, West Kordofan and Blue Nile states remain affected with landmines and ERW, which will require continuous support from donor and UN community until Sudan meets its obligations under the Convention,” she concludes.

Title: On the World Polio week 2019: Sudan celebrates the declaration of the Global eradication of wild poliovirus type 3 and renews its commitment to keeping Sudan polio free
Content: 26 October 2019
The Government of Sudan, WHO, UNICEF and health partners mark World Polio week 2019
The Government of Sudan in partnership with World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Funds (UNICEF), and other health partners supporting the national polio program in Sudan marked World Polio week 2019 and the declaration of the global eradication of poliovirus- type 3 strain.
The celebrations involved a series of awareness raising activities and emphasized the importance of the continued support by the international community to eradicate the remaining Type -1 virus.
“The Government of Sudan, WHO, UNICEF and all partners have achieved a milestone success in keeping the country free of polio and protecting our children against this crippling and fatal infectious disease,” said Dr.  Akram Ali Altoum, Federal Minister of Health in Sudan. “We need to continue advocating for a strong routine immunization program in Sudan. We hold ourselves and our community members accountable for maintaining polio- free Sudan,” he added.
Sudan has not reported any polio cases since March 2009 and was announced polio-free in 2015 by the Regional Certification Committee of WHO. Over 95 percent of children are reached with polio vaccine, thanks to  the strong collaboration between the Federal and State Ministries of health, partners, and the generous support from donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Rotary International, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Vaccine Alliance GAVI, the Department for International Development (DFID)- United Kingdom, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation.
“The world can only overcome the final hurdles to completely eradicate polio if the present strategies put to reach and vaccinate children everywhere in the world receive sufficient resources and commitments from governments, donors, multilateral organizations and local communities,” said Dr Naeema Al Gasseer, WHO Representative in Sudan. “The eradication of polio is a global endeavor and to succeed, we should leave no child behind. Every target child must be immunized until this deadly disease is eradicated and the whole world is polio-free,” she added.
“Awareness of the community and their active engagement is critical to eradicate polio and sustain the gains made so far,” said Mr. Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Sudan Country Representative. “During this critical time we should not  forget about the children living in areas inaccessible  since 2011, peace is crucial as it will let us reach those children in the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state and Blue Nile state under the control of Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N).” he added.
Despite the successes, challenges remain and require innovative approaches to regain the world momentum toward the full eradication of polio and maintaining the routine immunization coverage to eliminate the conditions for the virus to regain strength and spread.
WHO, UNICEF and non-governmental health partners in Sudan will continue to support the Ministry of Health to maintain sensitivity of surveillance and increase vaccination coverage in the country.

Title: UNAMID calls for restraint in violence as rainy season starts in Darfur
Content: 15 August 2019
The African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) is concerned about the recent increase in tensions between farmers and pastoralists during this rainy season in Darfur where several people have either been killed or injured with no immediate indications of constraint from concerned parties. UNAMID calls on all those involved to exercise restraint.
UNAMID is aware of 37 incidents that occurred in July. Two recent events that illustrate the impact of attacks include: On 11 August, UNAMID Shangil Tobaya Team Site (TS) in North Darfur, was informed that the previous night, three male IDPs from Nifasha IDP camp (Shangil Tobaya) were killed by armed pastoralists in the Kargo farming area. UNAMID TS personnel urged the IDPs to report the incident to the Government of Sudan (GoS). Government authorities responded and negotiated the release of the suspected perpetrators being held by the nomadic community in Kargo. On 13 August, a UNAMID patrol team from Shangil Tobaya TS visited Nifasha IDP camp, for verification of the incident. The patrol team interacted with local IDPs who confirmed the incident had taken place.
Similarly, on 11 August, a 65-year old male IDP was working in his field in Hilla Hesoulwa farming area, also in Shangil Tobaya area, when four armed pastoralists drove their large herd of camels into his farm. The IDP drove the camels away from his field. In response, an armed pastoralist opened fire and shot the IDP in his left thigh. Two IDPs from Nifasha camp rushed to the scene and carried the wounded IDP to UNAMID Shangil Tobaya Team Site, where the injured received first aid and was referred to a nearby clinic for further treatment.
UNAMID is extremely concerned regarding the number of incidents, including intercommunal clashes, occurring at the beginning of the rainy season. Many of the reported confrontations are linked to farmers attempting to access land for farming and being prevented from doing so by armed pastoralists.
“UNAMID is quite disturbed by these reported clashes between farmers and pastoralists. Lives are needlessly lost and sometimes people are injured or lose their entire crop due to this wanton display of violence. The Mission strongly urges maximum restraint in clashes and reiterates its commitment to continue to find creative and robust ways to prevent or respond to these incidents including with authorities,” Jeremiah Mamabolo, Joint Special Representative/Joint Chief Mediator, reacted.
Mr. Mamabolo added that “currently, UNAMID has increased its protection of civilians response through re-focusing farming patrols to the most affected areas. The Mission has also enhanced community-based peaceful coexistence initiatives and will continue to facilitate longer-term arrangements for sharing land and natural resources. For UNAMID, even one reported case is one case too many as these prevent the people of Darfur from fully tilling their land to eke out a living for their families.”
In addition, UNAMID Leadership continues to engage authorities at the state and federal levels to encourage the Government to intensify its efforts to prevent and respond to such incidents.

Title: UN And Partners Steps-Up Efforts to Prevent and Respond to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Sudan
Content: 16 July 2019
The United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Sudan, The African Union - United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), the INGO Forum in Sudan and partners in the donor community namely Switzerland,  Sweden and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) have signed today a Joint Framework for Action on Prevention and Response to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (JFA- PSEA) as a commitment to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse within its own ranks and ensure that rights and dignities of the communities they serve are front and centre.
The initiative represents a visible demonstration of resolve and commitment by the UN and partners in Sudan to set a standard for preventing, responding to and eradicating sexual exploitation and abuse and addressing its impact. It will be achieved through actions in 6 core areas covered in the joint framework for action: policy operationalization, coordination and cooperation, prevention and internal mainstreaming, advocacy, complaints and investigations, and survivor support.
The action framework was developed under the auspices of the Sudan PSEA Network, which serves as the primary body for overall coordination and oversight of prevention and response to sexual exploitation and abuse by all development and humanitarian actors in Sudan such as the UN, INGOs and donors.
The network is chaired by the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Ms Gwi-Yeop Son and has been established to ensure a coherent and coordinated approach to strengthen efforts to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse in Sudan.
The JFA-PSEA is a living document which shall provide a basis for continuous tracking of progress and resource needs on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian and development actors across Sudan. It remains open for signatures by agencies / organizations who are not able to sign it on 16th July and may subsequently wish to do so.
To make zero tolerance for  sexual exploitation and abuse a reality, continued efforts have been taken by the United Nations including the appointment by the Secretary-General in February 2016 of a Special Coordinator on Improving the United Nations Response to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and the appointment in August 2018 of the first Victims’ Rights Advocate for the United Nations.
In his first week in office as UN Secretary-General, António Guterres established a High-Level Task Force to develop ambitious new proposals to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse committed by those serving the UN flag.

Title: UN Special Representative Pramila Patten expresses grave concern over alleged acts of sexual violence against civilians in Sudan and calls for their immediate cessation
Content: 13 June 2019
United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Mrs. Pramila Patten, is gravely concerned about the situation in Sudan following recent reports of attacks by security forces and paramilitaries against the pro-democracy protesters who have been holding a sit-in outside army headquarters in Khartoum.
Despite restrictions on communications in Sudan, reports have emerged alleging serious human rights violations being committed by elements of the Rapid Support Forces and militias since 3 June 2019. These include the rapes and gang rapes of protesters, women’s human rights defenders and women medical personnel working in hospitals near the sit-in. Pending verification of these alleged incidents by relevant United Nations bodies, Special Representative Patten highlights the fact that the weakness of the rule of law and a general climate of impunity for alleged perpetrators of human rights violations in Sudan is further compounding a highly-volatile context.
“I demand the immediate and complete cessation of all violence against civilians including sexual violence. The Rapid Support Forces, which have consistently been listed by the Secretary-General in his annual report on conflict-related sexual violence, should take effective measures to prevent and punish sexual violence in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution 2467 (2019),” stated Special Representative Patten. “I urge the prompt investigation of all credible allegations of sexual violence and accountability for those responsible,” Special Representative added.
Special Representative Patten strongly supports the rapid deployment of a United Nations human rights monitoring team to examine the situation on the ground, including alleged cases of sexual violence, and appeals for the full cooperation of the transitional authority in the deployment of such a mission. She also calls upon the international community, including members of the Security Council, to use all possible diplomatic channels with leaders of Sudan to pave the way for a swift transition to a civilian administration and an end to all forms of violence and intimidation against civilians.

Title: Children killed, injured, detained and abused amid escalating violence and unrest in Sudan
Content: 11 June 2019
At least 19 children have reportedly been killed in Sudan and another 49 have been injured since June 3. I am gravely concerned at the impact of the continuing violence and unrest in the country on children and young people, especially the reported use of excessive force against peaceful protestors.
“We have received information that children are being detained, recruited to join the fighting and sexually abused. Schools, hospitals and health centres have been targeted, looted and destroyed. Health workers have been attacked simply for doing their job.
“Many parents are too scared to let their children leave the house, fearful of violence, harassment and lawlessness.
“Water, food and medicine shortages have been reported across the country, putting children’s health and wellbeing at risk.
“Children throughout Sudan are already bearing the brunt of decades of conflict, chronic underdevelopment and poor governance. The current violence is making a critical situation even worse.
“Even in the face of this unrest, UNICEF’s work for children in Sudan continues. We are providing millions of children, including those who have been displaced or are refugees, with vaccines, safe water, treatment for severe acute malnutrition and psychosocial support.
“But the violence must stop.
“UNICEF appeals to all those involved to protect children at all times and to keep them out of harm’s way. Any attack on children, schools or hospitals is a grave violation of children’s rights.
“UNICEF calls on the authorities to allow humanitarian organizations to respond to those in need, including through access to hospitals that have been off-limits or closed.
“I join the Secretary-General in urging the parties to pursue peaceful dialogue and resume negotiations over the transfer of power to a civilian-led transitional authority. The children of Sudan want peace. The international community needs to take a firm stand in support of their aspirations.”

Title: Statement by the WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari
Content: 07 June 2019
WHO is gravely concerned about the recent impact of violence in Sudan on people in need, health workers and medical facilities.
Incursions into hospitals in Khartoum have resulted in emergency services being shut down, the unwarranted transfer of patients, injuries to five medical staff and patients, and threats to others.
Health care workers appear to have been targeted for fulfilling their professional duties in providing care to the injured.
Mobile health tent clinics, which were set up to treat injured protestors, have also been set on fire and destroyed; medical equipment looted, and health care workers assaulted. Rapes of female health workers have also been reported.
These actions represent a total and unacceptable violation of international human rights law and must stop. Health care, especially emergency services, should be protected from political interference and security operations. Health workers must be allowed to treat the injured and sick, without concern for their own safety or that of their patients.
We call for an immediate cessation of all activities that put the lives of health staff and patients at risk and disrupt the delivery of essential health services.
WHO, together with the Federal Ministry of Health of Sudan, is continuing to play a critical role in ensuring that hospitals remain operational and that essential medicines are brought into the country in a timely manner. Nine trucks carrying WHO medical supplies have already arrived in Khartoum and priority states for distribution to hospitals and health facilities.
WHO will continue to monitor the situation and speak out as necessary about this unacceptable situation that has not only resulted in deaths and injuries, but also attacks against the very professionals and facilities meant to help.

Title: Bachelet urges Sudan authorities to protect human rights and rule of law
Content: 12 April 2019
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Friday reminded the authorities in Sudan of their overarching duty to ensure the protection of the human rights of all people and to refrain from the use of violence.
"This is a very critical, volatile moment for Sudan and there is deep uncertainty and unease about the future," Bachelet said. "We are closely monitoring developments and call on the authorities to refrain from using force against peaceful protestors, and to ensure that security forces and judicial authorities act in full accordance with the rule of law and Sudan’s international human rights obligations."
The High Commissioner appealed for calm and called on the authorities to release all those detained for their exercise of the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.
"The crisis in Sudan has its roots in human rights grievances – economic, social, civil and political rights. The solution must also be grounded in human rights," she said.
"I call on the Government to address the people’s demands. There needs to be a concerted effort, with the meaningful participation of civil society, to work to resolve these grievances."
She also stressed the need for independent, prompt and effective investigations into the excessive use of force against protestors since December last year.
Bachelet reiterated the readiness of the UN Human Rights Office to strengthen its engagement with Sudan to advise and assist the State in discharging fully its human rights obligations.

Title: UN experts condemn excessive use of force at protests

UN human rights experts condemn reports of excessive use of force against peaceful protesters in Sudan
UN human rights experts* have condemned reports of excessive use of force against peaceful protesters in Sudan. While taking note of the latest reports that a military council is being formed, the experts called on the authorities to respond to the legitimate grievances of the people.
More than 20 people have been killed and over 100 injured since 6 April, the experts said, adding they had also received reports of widespread arrests and attacks on journalists by the security forces.
At a demonstration in front of the headquarters of the Sudanese Armed Forces in Khartoum, the National Intelligence and Security Services used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse protesters, prompting the army to move in to protect them, the experts said.
"In this moment of crisis, the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly needs to be protected and guaranteed," said the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, David Kaye.
Protests erupted nearly four months ago when the Government attempted to raise the prices of bread and basic commodities.
"I urge the authorities to lift the national state of emergency and respond to the legitimate grievances of the Sudanese people through inclusive peaceful political process," Voule said. “The Sudanese people, including human rights defenders, have the right to express their views and concerns through peaceful means, in particular on issues concerning fundamental rights,” added Michel Forst, UN Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.
The UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Sudan, Aristide Nononsi, said the State’s institutions are obliged to protect civilians and respect the people’s legitimate demands and constitutional rights.
"I call on State authorities to uphold their primary responsibility to protect the civilian population in Sudan, and I strongly urge the Sudanese military and security forces to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid further escalation of violence and to take immediate measures to protect the constitutional rights of the Sudanese," Nononsi said.
The Independent Expert on Sudan welcomed an invitation from the Government to visit the country from 27 April - 5 May.
"I urge the authorities to facilitate an independent and thorough investigation into the human rights violations committed during the protests, and call on the judiciary to stop using so-called emergency courts which do not adhere to fair trial standards,” Nononsi said.
The UN experts expressed their readiness to cooperate with all parties to help establish a State where human rights are central and the rule of law upheld.

Title: Emergency Response Fund releases US$26.5 million for life-saving assistance in Sudan
Content: 11 April 2019
UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund provides life-saving food, livelihood, nutrition, health, water and sanitation assistance to over 800,000 people affected by a worsening economic crisis and food insecurity across seven states in Sudan over the next six months
Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock today released a $26.5 million Rapid Response allocation from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund to provide life-saving food, livelihood, nutrition, health, water and sanitation assistance to over 800,000 people affected by a worsening economic crisis and food insecurity across seven states in Sudan over the next six months.
“The economic crisis has had knock-on effects on the wider humanitarian situation that go beyond food insecurity. Higher food prices mean that families are eating less nutritious food and more young children and pregnant women are getting sick. Families struggle to afford even limited medical treatment. With jobs lost, they are also being forced to pull their children out of schools,” said Mr. Lowcock.
The CERF allocation will target internally displaced people, refugees, host communities, and vulnerable residents in areas with some of the largest increases in food insecurity, including in East, North, South and West Darfur, Red Sea, West Kordofan and White Nile states.
Food insecurity has increased in Sudan with 5.8 million people projected to be food insecure between January and March, a significant increase from 2018, while the numbers are likely to rise further in the lean season from May.
Protection services will also be prioritised targeting the specific needs of children and women, and the vulnerable including people living with disabilities and those with chronic health conditions.
“The funds will help aid organizations ramp up the treatment of severe and moderate acute malnutrition among young children and pregnant women, provide safe drinking water, and repair and construct essential sanitation and hygiene facilities to mitigate preventable diseases,” said Mr. Lowcock.
The allocation will also boost essential medical services and maternal, child and reproductive healthcare for 320,000 people, including through the distribution of medical supplies and equipment for 65 health facilities and the training of healthcare professionals and community health volunteers.
Farmers and herders in targeted areas will also receive emergency agricultural and livestock inputs and training to improve food and livestock production for over half a million people.
While the CERF allocation will be complemented by a $21 million contribution from the Sudan Humanitarian Fund, overall funding remains insufficient to meet the growing level of needs across Sudan. In 2019, the UN will seek $1 billion to assist 4.4 million of the most vulnerable people in Sudan.
While violence has also significantly reduced across the country, 1.9 million people remain displaced, and Sudan is hosting 1.2 million refugees mainly from South Sudan.
CERF pools contributions from donors around the world into a single fund allowing humanitarian responders to deliver life-saving assistance whenever and wherever crises hit. On average, more than half of CERF-funded humanitarian action addresses the needs of women and girls.

Title: UN-Habitat Sudan Receives USD 700,000 from Japan to Support Peaceful IDP Returns to South Darfur, Sudan
Content: 17 February 2019
Japan has pledged a contribution of USD 700,000 to the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in Sudan’s project “Emergency Support to IDP Return in Alsalam Locality, South Darfur State” for a period of one year running from March 2019 to March 2020. The project will benefit some 17,100 returned Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) and hosting communities in Dagariss village, located 22 km southwest of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur.
Dagariss village is one of the communities which have seen a tremendous number of IDP returns in Darfur. Nevertheless, they are facing the severe living condition and lack of basic services, public facilities and security of their own land and are in need of support.
Through the support of Japan, the project aims to support sustainable IDP return and ensure human security of both the returned IDPs and hosting communities through the development of guiding principle of IDP returns and securing their land rights. The project also aims to enhance self-reliance of the returned IDPs and hosting communities particularly youth and women through self-help construction and improvement of basic services and public facilities.
The project follows the Security Council Resolution 2429 adopted in July 2018 that renews the mandate of African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur (UNAMID); particularly article 46 that highlights “the importance of addressing land issues for realization of durable solutions in Darfur” and “create the conditions conducive to allowing the voluntary, informed, safe, dignified and sustainable return of IDPs”.
Last year, Japan also provided UN-Habitat Sudan with USD 900,000 to support South Sudanese refugees and hosting communities in Aljabalain Locality, White Nile State, Sudan.

Title: Statement on the impact of the ongoing turmoil and economic crisis on children in Sudan from Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa
Content: 23 January 2019
Children were reportedly killed in ongoing turmoil that broke out last month in Sudan. According to reports, scores of children were also injured while others were detained.
“While it is difficult for UNICEF to verify these reports, children must be protected at all times from all forms of violence, harm, cruelty and mistreatment whether physical or mental. Children should never be targeted nor used or exploited.
“In recent months Sudan has witnessed an unprecedented hike in the cost of living and shortages in bread and fuel.  Poverty among children and their families has increased, forcing some families to negative measures like taking their children out of school. According to reports received by UNICEF, more children now require health and nutrition care.
“UNICEF calls on the authorities in Sudan to prioritize the protection of children and safeguard their rights to education and health in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.”

Title: Reports of excessive force against Sudan protests deeply worrying – Bachelet
Content: 17 January 2019
Credible reports of the use of excessive force, including live ammunition, by State security forces against protestors across Sudan over the past month are deeply worrying, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said Thursday. Bachelet called on the Government to protect the exercise by all of their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, regardless of their political affiliations.
The demonstrations since 19 December 2018 have taken place in a number of cities across Sudan, including Wad Madani, Port Sudan, Al-Qadarif, Atbara, Berber, Dongla, Karima, Al-Damazin, Al Obeid, Khartoum, Sinar, Bara, Nyala and Omdurman. The Government has confirmed that 24 people have died in the course of the protests, but other credible reports suggest the death toll may be nearly twice as high. Many others have been injured. According to information received, security forces have also followed some protestors into the Omdurman Hospital and fired tear gas and live ammunition inside the premises of the hospital. Reports also suggest that police fired tear gas inside Bahri Teaching Hospital and Haj Al-Safi Hospital. These two hospitals are in Khartoum North, where a large protest was organized by opposition groups.
Authorities have also confirmed that up to 6 January, at least 816 people were arrested in connection with the demonstrations. Reports indicate that these include journalists, opposition leaders, protestors and representatives of civil society.
“A repressive response can only worsen grievances,” High Commissioner Bachelet said.
“I am very concerned about reports of excessive use of force, including live ammunition, by Sudanese State Security Forces during large-scale demonstrations in various parts of the country since 19 December. The Government needs to ensure that security forces handle protests in line with the country’s international human rights obligations by facilitating and protecting the right to peaceful assembly.” *
As a State party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since 1986, Sudan is obliged to take all necessary measures intended to prevent arbitrary deprivations of life by their law enforcement officials. In particular, all operations of law enforcement officials should comply with relevant international standards, including the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials (General Assembly resolution 34/169)(1979) and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990).
The High Commissioner noted that fact-finding committees had been established by the Government and the National Commission of Human Rights. She urged that any investigations be conducted in a prompt, thorough and transparent manner, with a view to accountability.
“I also call on the authorities to ensure that all those arbitrarily detained for the exercise of their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression are promptly released, and that these rights are fully protected,” Bachelet added.
“I urge the authorities to work to resolve this tense situation through dialogue, and call on all sides to refrain from the use of violence.”
Bachelet stressed the readiness of the UN Human Rights Office to deploy a team to Sudan, to advice the authorities and help ensure they act in accordance with the country’s international human rights obligations.

Title: UN experts urge halt to excessive use of force against peaceful protesters
Content: 28 December 2018
UN experts today expressed alarm at Sudan’s escalating violence and reports of protesters killed during recent large-scale demonstrations against rising prices and food and fuel shortages.
"The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is an inherent element of democracies," said the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, Clement Nyaletsossi Voule.
He said he was deeply concerned at reports of government security forces using live ammunition during protests which have swept the country since 19 December. "The Government should respond to legitimate grievances of the Sudanese people," the Special Rapporteur said.
The UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, Aristide Nononsi, said the use of lethal force was unacceptable when controlling demonstrations.
"Dissent must be tolerated and not restrained with excessive force which can lead to loss of life. I strongly urge the Sudanese security forces to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid the escalation of violence and take immediate measures to protect the right to life of the demonstrators," Nononsi said.
The experts said they were also concerned at reports of arbitrary arrests and detentions of unknown numbers of protesters, including students and political activists. "We call on the Sudanese authorities to release those detainees. We also urge the authorities to carry out independent and thorough investigations and to ensure that security forces handle protests in line with the country’s international human rights obligations."
The UN rights experts said the Government of the Sudan in May 2016 had pledged to foster an environment that supports inclusive dialogue, instituting legal reforms to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. "The events of recent days do not demonstrate this commitment," they said.
The UN experts said they are ready to cooperate with the Sudanese authorities and parties to work to establish a State where human rights is central and the rule of law is upheld. They will continue to follow-up on the situation in the Sudan.

Title: Italia and UNWOMEN: Launching of the programme aimed at enhancing women’s entrepreneurial capacity in Fisheries and Agribusiness in Red Sea State
Content: 02 December 2018
Italy and UNWOMEN signed on December 2, 2018 the technical agreement for the two-year project aimed at enhancing women’s entrepreneurial capacity in Fisheries and Agribusiness in Red Sea State, in particular in traditional area of intervention such as Port Sudan, Suakin and Mohammed Gool, funded by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation and implemented by the UN Agency.
The initiative wants to contribute to women’s economic empowerment and to support livelihoods through three main tools of intervention: introduction of new technologies to increase the productivity of women in fisheries and agribusiness; access to financial and non-financial services and promotion of women’s cooperatives and associations. The project will improve the competences of the women involved in terms of small business management and techniques of processing and commercialization of agri-business products, especially fish, a precious resource in the State of Red Sea. Moreover, the objective is to produce food with high nutritional content, especially baby food.
To boost the development of key agricultural value chains and market access are our main goal to support Sudan in its efforts to revive its agriculture, affirmed the Italian Ambassador, H.E Fabrizio Lobasso. Italy is committed in supporting women’s empowerment and gender equality and the UNWOMEN initiative is in line with our strategy. Women are the are key to agriculture and food security in Sudan. This project will close the gaps between men and women in their value chain, thereby creating new opportunities for the agribusiness and fisheries sector as a whole, concluded the Ambassador.
Women carry out a major portion of agricultural activities and bear almost the entire burden of household work, including water and fuelwood collection and food processing and preparation. Empowering women to play their active role in the production and enjoy the benefit is the most sustainable way to positively transform poverty and leave no one behind, said Adjaratou Fatou Ndiaye, UNWOMEN Country Representative in Sudan. Agriculture and fisheries can be an important engine of growth and poverty reduction and women are a crucial resource facing constraints that reduce their productivity.
Through this project Italy and UNWOMEN will boost gender-smart solutions in agribusiness in order to increase the sector’s productivity and profitability and lead to stronger, more integrated value chains.

Title: Successful UN Environment project contributes to peace and economic recovery in North Darfur
Content: 26 November 2018
Growing demand and climate change make water among the most pressing challenges the world faces in the 21st century. Sudan is no exception. Climate change is hitting the country hard. As an example, rainfall in El Fasher in North Darfur declined by half over the last decade and the area viable for non-irrigated agriculture is expected to move 100km southwards in the states of North Darfur, North Kordofan, and Kassala.
The first phase of the Wadi El Ku Catchment Management project built sustainable infrastructures to spread seasonal water to a wider area, increased agricultural productivity, reduced erosion, partially reversed the displacement of farmers, improved joint decision-making, and contributed to peace and stability in North Darfur.
The project notably helped triple agricultural productivity in millet and sorghum. When asked, 7 out of 10 people said that their income had increased, which they attributed to the project. “Many parts of Sudan are facing climate-related challenges and we need to replicate such projects in other parts of Sudan,” said H.E. Dr. Osman Mohamed Youssif Kibir, Vice President of Sudan.
“Wadi El Ku – Phase 1 was very successful: three dams and one hafir have been constructed, allowing 1,584 households from 54 villages to cultivate also during part of the dry season. The improved livelihood, the potential for reforestation are a big success and UN Environment and Practical Action, as well as the local authorities and villagers involved should be commended for this achievement,” said H.E. Ambassador Jean-Michel Dumond, Head of Delegation, European Union in Sudan.
The new phase will more than triple the area covered by the project, expanding to all communities upstream and downstream of the Wadi El Ku catchment. Consequently, this will be a demonstration project for uptake and replication in Darfur and Sudan in the future. It will also contribute to the overall objective of establishing climate-resilient livelihoods and reducing natural resource conflicts and displacement due to loss of livelihoods in North Darfur.
“Building on a successful first phase, the purpose of this project is to continue to demonstrate how this harmful cycle can be halted and eventually reversed while at the same time rebuilding relationships over natural resources,” said Mr. Atila Uras, UN Environment Country Programme Manager for Sudan.
The second phase of the project will demonstrate interventions that enhance agricultural productivity, improve natural resource management, and strengthen cooperation over natural resources at the community level. With this expansion, our intervention will directly support over 80,000 farming families and provide benefits to around 700,000 people living near the wadi or depending on its water for their livelihoods.
The Wadi El Ku Catchment Management Project will also expand the science base on water and natural resources, as well as the inclusive natural resource management system established under the first phase, to serve improved decision-making on water and natural resources across the wider catchment.
On 26 November, in Kafod, North Darfur, amid the environmental degradation and conflict that have faced Wadi El Ku’s people, two thousand people including Sudanese dignitaries and representatives of the international community celebrated the launch of the second phase of the Wadi El Ku Catchment Management Project, a four-year commitment funded by the European Union.
The project is implemented by UN Environment in partnership with the government of Sudan, the state government of North Darfur, local-based civil society organizations and local communities. The combined strengths, contributions, and commitment of these partners will continue to ensure positive change and serve as a model for how partnerships can strengthen livelihoods, protect the environment, and contribute to peace in Darfur and Sudan.

Title: Climate services expanded to play a bigger role in Sudan
Content: 17 October 2018
A delegate from the Meteorological Office of the United Kingdom (UK Met Office), John Faragher, Senior International Development Manager visited Sudan from the 8th to 12th October. This visit was organised by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), in collaboration with United Nations Environment Programme in Sudan. The purpose of the visit was to scope out the potential of developing a strategic partnership with relevant government stakeholders, UN agencies, and the private sector to further the co-operation in the priority areas of weather forecasting and climate modelling and provide technical support to the Government of Sudan through ‘Adapt for Environment and Climate Resilience Project’ (ADAPT!).
John Faragher, Senior International Development Manager at the Met Office, said: “The world is impacted by a changing climate, and many people, including those in Africa, are on the front line. Without doubt, we will be facing more climate shocks through extreme weather events. Improving forecasting and modelling can help make all of us more resilient in the future and will help us meet these challenges. This can only be achieved by working in partnership, sharing skills, knowledge, data and technology.”
In order to address and reduce the risk that climate change and variability may pose to fragile areas in Sudan, policymakers and practitioners must be able to access, understand and use information and data on the local, national and global climate.  In this respect, UN Environment, DFID, the Embassy of the Netherlands, the Sudan Meteorological Authority, and the UK Met Office held a workshop on “Sahel Rainfall Trend Analysis” on 9 October at the British Embassy in Khartoum. The workshop participants discussed the latest research on Sahel rainfall trends and introduced climate modelling techniques from the Met Office. Further meetings were held with UN agencies and the private sector to assess their needs in relation to climate services.
Dr Ahmed Mohamed Abdelkarim, Director General of the Sudan Meteorological Authority (SMA), said: “The support of regional and international organizations in capacity development and infrastructure improvement has contributed to the enhancement of SMA capabilities and performance to deliver high quality of climate service. We are ambitious to further build a strategic partnership with UK Met Office aimed at improving our capacity and capability to produce user-centered climate services, medium- and long-term climate predictions, and climate change scenarios for adaptation and mitigation projects in Sudan”.
Atila Uras, UN Environment's Sudan Country Programme Manager, stated: “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, which would require ‘rapid and far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society’. This strategic partnership between UN Environment, DFID, the Sudan Meteorological Authority, and the UK Met Office will improve climate change mitigation and disaster preparedness strategies”.
The UK Met Office hopes to explore potential areas of strategic collaboration and the feasibility of piloting a medium-term (2 to 5 years) weather forecasting and climate models in Sudan, working with Sudan’s Meteorological Authority, UN Environment and a broader network of partners to support climate change mitigation efforts. UN Environment will continue to support more sustainable national development paths through effective climate policies for the benefit of future generations.

Title: WHO and FMOH meet to set priorities for strengthening the emergency care system in Sudan
Content: 23 July 2018
The Federal Ministry of Health in Sudan with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and in collaboration with emergency care partners and stakeholders, concluded a consensus meeting organized to address the gaps identified by the Emergency Care System Assessment (ECSA), conducted in Sudan in 2018.
The 2-day meeting which was attended by 51 participants including partners, policymakers, and emergency care providers from Federal and States levels, initiated the basis for developing a priorities action plan to strengthen the emergency care system in the country.
The consensus on the findings of the comprehensive system-level assessment will consider the legislative and governance frameworks of the decentralized health system in Sudan’s 18 states. It will also guide the development of a countrywide Emergency Care System (ECS) implementation plan that focuses on a wide range of medical, surgical and obstetric services including injury, complications of pregnancy, exacerbations of non-communicable diseases, and acute infections.
“The FMOH, WHO, and partners will continue work to identify potential resources and key stakeholders to step up the implementation of strengthening the emergency care system plan in Sudan,” said Dr. Naeema Al Gasseer, WHO Representative in Sudan.
“Every individual needs to be ready for emergencies. We would like to advocate for conducting a series of first aid courses at schools, factories, and communities since such skills save lives” she added.
WHO estimates road traffic death rate in Sudan to be among the highest in the Eastern Mediterranean Region standing at 24 deaths per 100 000 population. ECSA data also reflected the availability of fully certified specialist programs in emergency medicine for doctors but not for nurses or specialists in trauma care area.
Findings also pinpointed the lack of formal and government-ratified certification pathway for pre-hospital care providers in addition to the absence of a single national emergency care access number.
This meeting is part of WHO regional initiative that aims to strengthen the emergency care systems in the EMR Member States. It is hoped that the outcome of this meeting will pave the way for more structured actions towards strong emergency medical care system and contribute to reducing the annually incurred death and disability rates in Sudan.

Title: UNFPA organized a workshop on “The Midwifery Gap Analysis in Sudan”
Content: 05 July 2018
The Federal Ministry of Health & United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) organized a workshop on “The Midwifery Gap Analysis in Sudan”, with the technical support from the International Confederation of Midwives.
The five-day workshop is to disseminate the results of the midwifery gap analysis that was conducted in 2017, covering all aspects of the midwifery programme.  The purpose was to develop a strategic plan for improving the midwifery education, regulation and association in Sudan in order to improve the quality of midwifery services in general.
The first day of the workshop was attended by 38 participants including policymakers, academia, the civil society, professional associations, and UN agencies, in addition to several departments of Sudan Federal Ministry of Health.

Title: The United Nations Secretary-General recognizes the full implementation of the Action Plan to end and prevent recruitment and use of children by the Government of Sudan
Content: 28 June 2018
Yesterday the United Nations Secretary-General issued his annual global report on Children and Armed Conflict, which shows the plight of children across the globe in conflict situations. Grave violations against children include recruitment and use of children, sexual violence against children, killing and maiming of children, abductions of children, attacks on schools and hospitals and denial of humanitarian access. The report will be debated by the United Nations Security Council on 9 July.
In his report, the UN Secretary-General states that the Sudan Government security forces took all necessary steps in its Action Plan pertaining to ending and preventing the recruitment and use of children. This is a result of the measures taken in the Action Plan to Protect Children from Violations in Armed Conflict jointly with the United Nations since its signature on 27 March 2016.
“The declaration by the UN Secretary-General is a clear result of the Government’s determination towards the protection of children who are affected by conflict in the country. The United Nations takes this opportunity to reiterate its full support to the Government of Sudan in promoting and protecting children’s rights in Sudan”, says Mr. Matthew Hollingworth, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator a.i. “UNAMID was proud to sign the Action Plan and now to see it fulfilled today,” adds Kingsley Mamabolo, the Joint Special Representative of UNAMID. He praised the Government of Sudan’s cooperation with UNAMID on issues related to children and armed conflict in the Darfur region.
As Co-Chairs of the Sudan Country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting (CTFMR), the Resident Coordinator, UNAMID, and UNICEF have supported implementation. “The completion of the Action Plan is a breakthrough achievement for the Government of Sudan in building protection systems for prevention of the recruitment and use of children that would not have been possible without full cooperation and partnership,” says Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Sudan Representative.
Implementation was steered by the High-Level Committee on the Action Plan chaired by the State Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Technical Committee chaired by the Secretary-General for the National Council for Child Welfare, as well as state committees chaired by Walis (Governors) and State Councils for Child Welfare. “In an unprecedented manner, the UN was granted access for monitoring and verification to military commanders, barracks, administrations, training centers, and recruitment points in conflict-affected states over 12 joint missions,” adds the UNICEF Representative. In 2017, 714 members of the Sudan Armed Forces, 202 Police, 130 National Intelligence and Security Service, and 172 Popular Defense Forces were trained on child rights, and, in 2018, 60 members of the Rapid Support Forces.
The Action Plan neared completion at the time of the visit of the UN SG’s Special Representative for CAAC, Virginia Gamba, to Sudan on 1 March 2018 with some key steps remaining. This included two major achievements in the institutional development of the protection system of children. First, the establishment of a complaint mechanism for communities to report cases of child recruitment on 26 April. Second, the adoption of standard operating procedures on release and handover of children formerly associated with armed groups on 28 April. “The Action Plan has crucially allowed for the release and reintegration of 44 children formerly with armed groups and in military detention,” Fadil further noted. Released children are supported through community-based reintegration programs, including family reunification, psychosocial support and access to education[1].
Completion of the Action Plan is notwithstanding the need to continued work to end all violations against children by all armed actors, including killing and maiming, sexual violence, and attacks on schools, as noted in the UN Secretary-General’s report. “While we celebrate this important milestone, UNICEF encourages Sudan to build on this framework by strengthening prevention and addressing negative social norms,” Fadil concludes. The UN in Sudan will support the Government to institutionalize the gains of the Action Plan by launching a national communications campaign to prevent violations against children, implementing the complaint mechanism, and training of forces on child rights. This is in line with the SG’s Special Representative’s call “to transform [the] Action Plan into a National Plan for prevention of violence against children.”[2]
The UN also advocates for ending the recruitment and use of children with the four non-state armed groups mentioned in the UN Secretary-General’s Report - Sudan People Liberation Movement-North[3] (SPLM-N), Justice Equality and Liberation Movement (JEM), Sudan Liberation Army/Minni Minawi (SLA/MM), and Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW). The SPLM-N signed an action plan with the UN in November 2016, and the UN Secretary-General welcomes implementation thus far and calls for access to their areas. JEM and SLA/MM issued respective command orders and agreed implementation plans to end child recruitment with the UN in April 2017, and the UN Secretary-General urges them to expedite measures therein.

Title: Canada Joins UN Efforts to Promote Rule of Law in Darfur
Content: 21 February 2018
The Canadian Government has recently contributed a total of USD 952,200 to the United Nations to build capacity in justice institutions in Darfur through the Joint Programme for Rule of Law (JPROL).
For years, the protracted conflict in Darfur has severely weakened rule of law institutions in the region. To make the much-needed transition to stability, it will be critical to address the prevailing insecurity in Darfur.  Following wide consultations with the Government of Sudan (GoS), civil society organizations, donors and UN agencies at all levels, the JPROL was launched in November 2016 to restore stability in Darfur.
The programme coordinates UN efforts to enhance the rule of law under one framework, pooling resources and formulating shared priorities to establish effective justice institutions in Darfur.
Representing a key pillar of social stability in the Darfur, the JPROL aims to strengthen rule of law institutions, improve people’s access to justice and enhance mechanisms to address land issues in Darfur.
Development interventions include the revision of selected laws and procedures; re-establishment of the criminal justice chain in pilot areas to which Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are likely to return; and building the capacity of and oversight over justice and security institutions.  The JPROL will also provide robust support to improve access to justice through the legal empowerment of vulnerable populations in Darfur, especially women, children and IDPs.
The Canadian contribution will be used for some key initial interventions:  USD 589,000 allocated to UNDP to strengthen community policing, whilst USD  261,000 will be dedicated to working with law enforcement institutions on the GoS Action Plan to end recruitment of child soldiers and violations against children carried out by UNICEF,  in addition to  USD 105,000  assigned to UNAMID to work with the corrections (prison police) area in Darfur.
This unprecedented joint programme in Sudan builds a solid foundation for sustainable peace reflecting national ownership and a strong sense of partnership and coordination between the UN and the Government as well as amongst UN agencies and other stakeholders. The programme further addresses the root causes of the conflict in Darfur, by supporting rights-based resolution of land issues.
In an event held today to celebrate Canada’s valuable contribution to the programme and celebrate valuable support for implementing the programme, as well as partnerships among the Government, UN and the donor community, the Canadian Ambassador Salah Bendaoud stated “Canada remains committed to supporting Government of Sudan and the international community initiatives to strengthen supremacy of law and human rights, and to achieve a lasting peace for the benefit of the people of Sudan.‎"
UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Ms. Marta Ruedas commended Canada’s valuable support for JPROL by affirming “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Government of Canada for its generous contribution to the programme. Working together with the Government, communities and NGOs, Canada’s support will give a positive momentum to further enhance the rule of law and human rights in Sudan. The United Nations has been working together, in consultation with our government counterparts, to implement activities to promote human rights and rule of law at institutional and community level. We developed the “Joint Rule of Law and Human Rights programme” with the spirit of One UN -- “together, we can do more” with the following three main objectives.
First, justice institutions, including specialized child justice system, are supported to provide equitable, effective and accountable justice services. These institutions include police, prosecution, judiciary, and corrections and native administration.
Second, access to justice is enhanced through more outreach and provision of legal aid services, including para-legal support, community-based centers where people get services such as the Justice and Confidence Centers in IDP camps and host communities.
Third, capacity of the justice system and local conflict resolution mechanisms are enhanced, to address various conflicts including competition over land resources which has been central to the conflict in Darfur.
For his part , H.E. Mr. Idris Suleiman Yousef , Minister of International Cooperation commended  the current cooperation with the international community in advancing human development in Sudan by saying “ As Sudan opens up to the world, we welcome all the international development partners in the country with an effective partnership and coordinated coordination for sustainable development that will relief the people of Sudan from the hardship reflected in their difficult living conditions caused by the two decades of economic sanctions. I further call on other international donors to further continue their support to Sudan.”
This distinctive programme has been initiated in implementation of Security Council Resolution Security Council Resolutions 2228 (2015) and 2296. Resolution 2228 concluded that certain UNAMID mandated tasks relating to the promotion of the rule of law in Darfur, as well as capacity-building of police and other local institutions which can combat impunity, will be transferred to entities with the necessary comparative advantage, meaning the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) in Sudan. In line with the recommendations of the High-Level Independent Panel on UN Peace Operations, JPROL will enable a seamless transfer of rule of law tasks through a well-coordinated handover to the UNCT, sharing of resources between UNAMID and the UNCT, and rapid build-up of UNCT capabilities under an organized funding plan.
