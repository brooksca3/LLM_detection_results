Title: Research Vessel Dr. Fridtjof Nansen advances sustainable fisheries in Ghana
Content: 07 June 2024
7 June 2024, Tema, Ghana – In celebration of World Oceans Day Celebrations on 8 June, the EAF-Nansen Programme partnered with Ghana’s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development and the Royal Norwegian Embassy to commemorate years of collaboration for the sustainable management of marine life.
Marking the special occasion, representatives from the Fisheries Committee for the West Central Gulf of Guinea (FCWC), public and private sectors in Ghana were invited to take a tour to take a guided tour of the research vessel (R/V) Dr. Fridtjof Nansen before she returns to sea.
“Today's activities underscore our collective commitment to stewardship, collaboration, and shared responsibility,” said Mr Abdul-Aziz Ayaba Musah, Deputy Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development in Ghana.
“As the Dr. Fridtjof Nansen sets sail for new endeavors, let us harness the power of knowledge, innovation, and collaboration to build a brighter, more sustainable future for Ghana's marine resources,“ Ayaba Musah added.
The R/V Dr. Fridtjof Nansen is at the centre of the EAF-Nansen Programme, a longstanding partnership between FAO, Norway, regional organizations and 32 partner countries in Africa and the Bay of Bengal. Named after the late Norwegian scientist, explorer, and humanitarian who was renowned for his ocean research contributions, the vessel is a platform for fostering cooperation among Partner countries, researchers and partner organizations of the EAF-Nansen Programme.
“The Dr. Fridtjof Nansen’s presence here today marks not only a milestone in our ongoing collaboration but also a testament to the enduring partnership between Ghana and Norway. Its legacy is one of unparalleled dedication to the preservation of our oceans and the livelihoods that depend on them” said Mr Kyrre Holm, Deputy Head of Mission, representing the Ambassador of Norway to Ghana.
In Ghana, fisheries play an important role in the economy and food security. The sector provides employment for many Ghanaians, particularly in coastal communities, and is a significant source of protein in peoples diets.

“Artisanal fishing communities are among the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. And as the Sustainable Development Goals commit to leaving no one behind, we must collectively ensure that artisanal fishing communities are not left behind” said the UN Resident Coordinator Mr Charles Abani.

Over the years, the R/V Dr. Fridtjof Nansen have conducted several scientific expeditions in Ghana, providing vital information for management of the oceans and marine life. In the two most recent surveys, 14 national scientists and technicians were involved, receiving hands-on training in the vessel's scientific equipment, research methods and analysis.

“The dedicated efforts have contributed to strengthening the capacities of fisheries institutions, generating effective fisheries management practices and scientific knowledge and research on marine resources and ecosystems in Ghana,” said Mr David Phiri, Special Adviser to the FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa, while noting the critical role of the EAF-Nansen Programme in driving  and supporting the sustainable management of aquatic food systems to eradicate hunger and poverty and foster economic growth.

Having recently completed a study on fisheries resources in the Western Gulf of Guinea, the vessel will return to sea on 8 June to do a survey in the waters off Ghana to assess the selectivity of trawl gear, with the aim of making bottom trawl fisheries more sustainable.

“With a focus on the nexus between science and management, the Programme is dedicated to its role as a catalyst for achieving sustainably managed oceans in the face of changing tides,” Merete Tandstad, EAF-Nansen Programme Coordinator, concluded.

About the EAF-Nansen Programme
The R/V Dr. Fridtjof Nansen is at the center of the EAF-Nansen Programme, a longstanding partnership between FAO and Norway, executed in close collaboration with the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR), dating back to 1975.
The Programme aligns with the objectives of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, as well as FAO's vision for the Blue Transformation of aquatic food systems for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life for all.

Title: Ghana Observes International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on 29 May
Content: 28 May 2024
Five Ghanaian peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously at UN ceremony.
Ghana will observe the 76th International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Wednesday, 29 May 2024 with a flag-raising and wreath-laying ceremony. UN Headquarters will observe the Day on Thursday, 30 May 2024
In 1948, the historic decision was made to deploy military observers to the Middle East to supervise the implementation of Israel-Arab Armistice Agreements, in what became the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization.
Since that time, more than two million peacekeepers from 125 countries have since served in 71 operations around the world. Today, some 76,000 women and men are serving in 11 conflict zones across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.
Ghana is the 7th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to the UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys more than 2,600 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, the Middle East, Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen and Western Sahara.
During formal ceremonies at UN Headquarters, Secretary-General, António Guterres, will lay a wreath to honour all UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948. He will also preside over a ceremony at which Dag Hammarskjöld Medals will be awarded posthumously to 64 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their lives serving under the UN flag, including 61 who perished last year.
Among the peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously with the Dag Hammarskjold medal are five (5) from Ghana: SSGT Mensah Alex AMEYAW and WOII Ibrahim ABUBAKARI who both served with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL); L/CPL Adjei Emmanuel NI ADDO who was deployed with (UNISFA); and civilian peacekeepers Mr. Michael Sowah and Mr. Jeduah Mahama Abudu who served respectively with the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM).

Title: The EU Food Security Response: 12,600 smallholder farmers receive agricultural inputs in northern Ghana
Content: 24 May 2024
23 May 2024, Accra – The European Union (EU), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Government of Ghana have delivered 118,000 kg of maize seeds, 3,000 kg of sorghum foundation seeds, and 540 kg of millet foundation seeds to support 12,600 smallholder farmers in the Bunkpurugu-Nakpanduri, Central Gonja, North Gonja, Northeast Gonja, Bongo, and Kasena Nankana West Districts in the Northern Region of Ghana.
Under the EU Food Security Response project, funded by the European Union and facilitated by FAO Ghana in collaboration with Ghana’s Ministry of Food and Agriculture, 31,200 bags of 50 kg NPK fertilizer and 14,000 bags of 50 kg urea fertilizer have also been delivered to support the farmers for the 2024 planting season.
Atintono Joseph, a farmer in the Bongo District, said that the previous unavailability of adequate fertilizers and high-quality seeds had adversely affected crop yields. “The fertilizers and seeds will now enable me to increase crop yields and ensure successful cultivation,” he said.
"This initiative underscores our unwavering commitment to enhancing food security and empowering local communities," said Arslen Bounemra, FAO Representative in Ghana. "We are proud to collaborate with the Ministry of Agriculture and the European Union to deliver essential agricultural inputs to farmers in Northern Ghana."
The European Union Ambassador to Ghana, Irchad Razaaly, said: “By combining our resources and expertise, the EU and FAO, in partnership with the Government of Ghana, are working together to ensure that farmers have access to high-quality seeds and other vital inputs necessary for successful crop cultivation for the 2024 planting season. This initiative is part of our broader mission to empower smallholder farmers, improve food security, and promote sustainable agricultural practices," he said.
This distribution exemplifies the project's dedication to enhancing agricultural productivity and food security in Northern Ghana. By equipping farmers with quality seeds, fertilizers, and equipment, the project aims to strengthen resilience and promote sustainable development within local farming communities.

Title: “Africa Month” at the UN to mobilize actions leveraging science, technology and innovation to transform education in Africa.
Content: 07 May 2024
Media accreditation for Africa Dialogue Series 2024  is open until 17 May 2024.

While the out-of-school population in Africa has significantly dropped in the last 20 years, the work continues across the continent to further accelerate progress. Focusing on the theme  “Education through Science, Technology and Innovation toward the Africa We Want,” the 2024  edition of the Africa Dialogue Series (ADS 2024) takes place at a time when a concerted, Africa-centred policy shift is needed to fast-track the transformation of the educational landscape on the continent.
This is in line with United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres’ call, as outlined in his “Our Common Agenda” report, to put innovation at the heart of global policymaking and end the business-as-usual approach in addressing the issues of our time. So, as the global community prepares for a Summit of the Future to demonstrate that international cooperation can effectively tackle current challenges, African leaders, their counterparts and partners around the world will converge online and at the United Nations Headquarters in New York throughout the month of May – the UN’s “Africa Month” – to participate in the ADS 2024 and mobilize actions that leverage the power of Science, Technology and Innovation to boost access to quality education in Africa.

The ADS 2024 will culminate with a High-level Policy Dialogue including the participation of several African ministers, Heads of Regional Economic Communities, young people, senior government and UN officials. This high-level segment will serve as a platform for in-depth exchanges, contributing policy recommendations that seek to accelerate the continent’s progress toward the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063.
Participants will explore this year’s theme from the perspective of the following sub-themes:
1) STEM Education for the Fourth Industrial Revolution – Generating Decent Jobs for Africa's Youth; 2) Transforming Education in Africa by Leveraging Innovative Finance and the Digital Revolution; and 3) Education and Learning in Crisis-affected Areas. These sub-themes will be developed during three international webinars featuring the United Nations Deputy Secretary[1]General’s input and three youth-focused events.
The United Nations Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA) and the African Union Permanent Observer Mission to the United Nations (AUPOM) co-organize the ADS 2024 in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank Group (WB).

Title: United Nations in Ghana and key partners set to roll out "I Pledge for Peace Campaign" in Ghana ahead of 2024 elections.
Content: 15 April 2024
As Ghana prepares for the upcoming 2024 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, the United Nations in Ghana, in collaboration with the National Peace Council, is set to roll out the "I Pledge for Peace Campaign". This initiative aims to reinforce the principles of peace among all Ghanaians before, during and after the forth coming elections.
The campaign, initially launched to coincide with the 2023 International Day of Peace, will actively engage a diverse range of stakeholders, including individuals, communities, civil society organizations, government entities, religious leaders, and youth groups. The overarching goal is to foster a culture of peace, advocate for peaceful elections, and promote tolerance and peaceful co-existence before, during, and after the electoral process.
"Elections represent a key moment for citizens to use their voting power to reflect, choose, and select leaders to act for their country and the future. This can only be possible when there is peace and stability, freedom, tolerance, and respect for one another. Elections are not a period of combat and the unhealthy exchange of views or for divisive language" says the UN Resident Coordinator in Ghana, Mr. Charles Abani. “We want to use this campaign to urge stakeholders to publicly commit to peace, and by extension, a peaceful election. We believe that the positive actions of stakeholders, through social media and other channels, will encourage tolerance and discourage misinformation.” He further notes.The campaign encourages individuals and organizations to make public pledges for peace, amplifying the message through various communication channels, including social media. The aim is to create a collective commitment to a peaceful electoral environment. These pledges will be shared on all the UN in Ghana and National Peace Council social media platforms.The Chairman of the National Peace Council, Rev. Dr. Ernest Adu-Gyamfi, underscores the importance of individual contributions to achieving peace. "Until every life is respected, and properties protected, achieving peaceful co-existence remains a distant goal. We all, as individuals, need to spread messages that encourage peace because its very existence begins with us, for all we have is one Ghana. The National Peace Council will do everything in its power to support this campaign and ensure a peaceful election come December 2024."The "I Pledge for Peace Campaign" reflects a collaborative effort between the United Nations, the National Peace Council, and various stakeholders to create a peaceful and inclusive electoral process in Ghana.Ghana’s democracy remains a beacon of hope for the continent. The UN continues to support the country to foster its development agenda in a peaceful atmosphere and uphold its reputation as a regional pacesetter for democratic governance.

Title: Ghana: Türk alarmed as parliament passes deeply harmful anti-gay bill
Content: 28 February 2024
PRESS RELEASES COMING FROM THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk today said the passage in the Ghanaian Parliament of the so-called “Human Sexual Rights and Family Values Bill, 2024” is profoundly disturbing.
“The bill broadens the scope of criminal sanctions against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transexual and queer people – simply for being who they are – and threatens criminal penalties against perceived allies of LGBTQ+ people,” said Türk.
“I call for the bill not to become law. I urge the Ghanaian Government to take steps to ensure everyone can live free from violence, stigma and discrimination, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Consensual same-sex conduct should never be criminalized.”
The High Commissioner also expressed deep alarm that the Bill criminalizes the legitimate work of human rights defenders, teachers, medical professionals, landlords, as well as people seeking healthcare, and unduly restricts freedom of association and expression of everyone in Ghana.
“The bill is contrary to Ghana’s own Constitution and freely-undertaken regional and international human rights obligations and commitments – including to leave no one behind in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” said the High Commissioner.
“Criminal sanctions for consensual same-sex conduct not only violate key international human rights norms and standards on equality, non-discrimination, privacy and equal protection of the law, among others – there is extensive evidence that they legitimize prejudice, expose people to hate crime, police abuse, harassment, intimidation, blackmail and torture. They also perpetuate discrimination and denial of access to basic services, including in healthcare, education and housing,” he added.
Türk stressed that the bill is corrosive and will have a negative impact on society as a whole.
He restated his Office’s commitment to work with the Government of Ghana and its national partners to ensure that Ghana fulfils its human rights commitments and obligations.

Title: UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima responds to the passage of the Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill in Ghana’s parliament
Content: 28 February 2024
STATEMENT FROM UNAIDS GENEVA
Responding to the passage of the Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill in Ghana’s parliament, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said:
“The Human Sexual rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill, a private member’s bill passed by parliament, has not yet become a law in Ghana.
If the bill does become a law, it will affect everyone.
Ghana is respected as a stable country where the rule of law prevails, a member of the Human Rights Council, and a global leader in fighting inequality. African values and principles of Ubuntu, dignity, non-discrimination, equality, empathy, protection from violence and care for each other shaped Ghana’s independence struggles, and have continued to be at the heart of Ghana’s society and constitutional democracy. Approaches rooted in inclusion of all people have been crucial to Ghana’s progress in the HIV response. To achieve the goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, it is vital to ensure that everyone has equal access to essential services without fear, stigma or discrimination, and that providers of life-saving HIV prevention, testing, treatment and care services are supported in their work.
If Human Sexual rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill becomes a law, it will exacerbate fear and hatred, could incite violence against fellow Ghanaian citizens, and will negatively impact on free speech, freedom of movement and freedom of association.
If it becomes law, it will obstruct access to life-saving services, undercut social protection, and jeopardize Ghana’s development success.
Evidence shows that punitive laws like this Bill are a barrier to ending AIDS, and ultimately undermine everyone’s health.”

The Fund was established as an independent entity by U.N. journalists over 60 years ago as a living memorial to the legacy of Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld.  It continues to be operated by U.N. journalists and relies on financial support from U.N. Missions, foundations, organizations and individuals.

Title: 57 countries make new pledges to strengthen peacekeeping operations at 2023 United Nations Peacekeeping Ministerial
Content: 07 December 2023
6 December 2023, Accra — Ninety-one Member States and three international organizations expressed their collective commitment and political support to United Nations Peacekeeping at the 2023 Ministerial, which concluded in Accra, Ghana today.
At the first Peacekeeping Ministerial held in Africa, 57 Member States announced new pledges to meet current and future challenges and needs, in line with ongoing reform under Action for Peacekeeping and A4P+, key priorities to improve peacekeeping effectiveness.
“The concrete pledges generated by this historic event will provide the cushion UN peace operations require to execute complex mandates in complicated environments,” said Ghana's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey.
“We are grateful to the Republic of Ghana for hosting this Ministerial and their ongoing contributions to UN Peacekeeping. As missions navigate unprecedented challenges, the political support and concrete pledges received today will help strengthen our effectiveness,” said Under-Secretary-General, Jean-Pierre Lacroix. “Ultimately, the goal of peacekeeping is to help parties end conflict by securing and implementing peace agreements and related political processes. In a world that is more divided than ever, the united and active engagement of Member States in this process is critical,” he added.
The Ministerial produced significant new commitments in high-need areas, such as aviation and infantry units, including quick reaction forces and rapidly deployable units to help our missions become nimbler and more robust in responding to threats. Member States also pledged reconnaissance and critical enabling units, such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal units. Together, these specialized capabilities will contribute to the protection of civilians and improve the safety and security of peacekeepers.
These include:
Partnerships, through training and capacity-building of troop and police contributing countries, were also a key commitment from many Member States.
In line with the meeting’s core themes, Member States recommitted to deploying more women in peacekeeping operations, including in leadership roles. Pledges were also announced to improve environmental management of missions by harnessing new technologies and switching to renewable energy as well as leaving a positive environmental legacy in host countries. In addition, Member States provided new support to strengthen mental health services for uniformed peacekeepers, the digital transformation of peacekeeping and resources to bolster strategic communication and address mis- and disinformation.
“I congratulate the Government of Ghana on the resounding success of the Peacekeeping Ministerial.  I am particularly grateful for wide ranging pledges from those that strengthen partnerships to build the capacity of uniformed peacekeepers to others that improve our logistics and health support as well as reduce our environmental footprint in the field. It underscores the pivotal role that partnership plays in UN peacekeeping. We are fully committed to do our utmost to support Member States in implementing their pledges to make peacekeeping more effective, efficient and impactful, said Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, Atul Khare.
“Every peacekeeper must serve with honour, upholding our standards and the reputation of the United Nations. This is an essential requirement for acceptance by local communities and to effectively implement our mandates. We work in close partnership with troop and police contributing countries to ensure those standards are met, and I thank all Member States who pledged their commitment to work with us to manage the risks of sexual exploitation and abuse, in particular, with a focus on prevention. I also thank those Member States who have voluntarily contributed to the Trust Fund in Support of Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and welcome any further contributions,” said Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance, Catherine Pollard
At the closing on Wednesday, Ghana passed the baton to Germany, who will host the next UN Peacekeeping Ministerial in 2025.
“The relationships formed and the commitments made during this Ministerial Meeting are not transient; they are seeds planted for a more peaceful and secure world, the harvest of which we will reap in the years ahead,” said Ghana’s Minister for Defence, Dominic Nitiwul.
More than 70,000 peacekeepers, who currently serve in 12 missions around the world, are helping to save lives, prevent conflict and creating conditions for lasting peace.
More information on the meeting, including statements and the list of pledges, can be found on the UN Peacekeeping website and on @UNPeacekeeping digital channels.

Title: 2023 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial Kicks Off in Accra, Ghana
Content: 04 December 2023
Ministers and delegates from more than 85 countries and international organizations will meet in Accra, Ghana for the 2023 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial meeting on 5-6 December to express their collective commitment to UN Peacekeeping.
The Ministerial seeks to secure vital political support and concrete commitments to strengthen UN Peacekeeping efforts to meet current and future challenges and needs, in line with ongoing reform under Action for Peacekeeping and the A4P+ implementation plan.
“Ultimately, peacekeeping is a political endeavor. Our goal is to help parties secure and implement peace agreements and related processes. To succeed in a world that is more divided than ever, we need the united and active engagement of Member States,” said Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix. “As missions navigate unprecedented challenges and threats, the Ministerial is an important opportunity for Member States to demonstrate their support and make concrete pledges to strengthen our effectiveness.”
The flagship event, co-hosted by the United Nations and the Republic of Ghana, marks the fifth such meeting at the Ministerial-level and the first to be held on the African continent.
“As a long-standing troop- and police-contributing country to UN Peacekeeping since the 1960s, Ghana acknowledges the long and positive track record of peacekeeping in Africa and believes that UN Peacekeeping has a future and remains indispensable and invaluable in advancing peace in conflict settings globally. It is therefore pertinent that the world remains resolute in our commitment to jealously guarding this multilateral tool and fully support the Secretary-General’s initiatives such as the Action for Peacekeeping and A4P+ which are essential to improving the effectiveness of modern-day peacekeeping and tackling the security challenges of our time,” said Ghana's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey.
The year's event will focus on crucial issues such as advancing sustainable peace, protection of civilians, strategic communications, and improving the safety and mental health of peacekeepers. During the two-day event, Member States and the UN will also work together to improve environmental management of our operations and deploy more women peacekeepers  to ensure more diverse and inclusive operations.
The Accra meeting is the latest in a series of high-level events that have enabled world leaders to pledge resources to help missions fully implement their mandates.  Beyond garnering political support, generous contributions by Member States at meetings in New York, London, Vancouver, and Seoul have helped generate rapidly deployable military units, key aviation assets, better medical capacities and to advance the Women, Peace, and Security agenda.

Title: Ghana: National Coordination Mechanism Launched to Strengthen Migration Governance
Content: 28 November 2023
Accra — On 28 November 2023, the Government of Ghana launched the National Coordination Mechanism (NCM) on Migration, supported by the UN Network on Migration and funded by the European Union. This mechanism is a key step in the institutional set-up needed to strengthen the coordination and coherence of the government’s work on migration. The NCM lays the foundation for the establishment of a migration commission as provided for under Ghana’s National Migration Policy.
Speaking at the launch, Ghana’s Minister for the Interior Hon. Ambrose Dery said: “The National Coordination Mechanism in Ghana is expected to play a key role in implementing the [Global Compact for Migration], among other responsibilities. This mechanism will be the primary coordination platform for government on all things related to migration, whether it is implementing the National Migration Policy, enhancing our migration data system, identifying our short-term priorities, or informing our partners on where the gaps are pronounced. I would like to thank all concerned parties who have worked on this tirelessly.”
Two key activities of the NCM will be the development of a national GCM implementation plan and a national migration knowledge management system. In preparation, Ghana carried out a mapping of stakeholders, a needs assessment and a series of consultations. These activities were informed by a step-by-step guidance produced by the UN Network on Migration — established the United Nations to ensure effective, timely and coordinated system-wide support to Member States in implementing, following-up and reviewing the GCM.
“The UN Network on Migration in Ghana reaffirms its support to the Government of Ghana in the implementation of the GCM. The establishment of the mechanism and the development of the implementation plan is a demonstration of this support,” said the UN Resident Coordinator in Ghana, Charles Abani.
The NCM brings together relevant government agencies from various sectors and levels of governance to implement the National Migration Policy and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) with a whole-of-government approach. These agencies cover priority areas such as labour mobility, diaspora engagement, remittances, migration data and research, human rights of migrants, trafficking in persons, irregular migration, assistance to and protection of migrants, return and reintegration, and climate-induced mobility, and others.
Recognizing the importance of migration for Ghana’s development, the government has recorded considerable progress in making migration more orderly and regular. The NCM is the latest step in this endeavor and will be instrumental in creating meaningful engagement and cooperation on migration by avoiding duplication of efforts.
EU Ambassador in Ghana, Irchad Razaaly, said: “Migration can only be managed jointly through partnership by all stakeholders. Whether it is addressing irregular migration, smuggling, challenges around return and reintegration, or paving the way for safe legal pathways, a concerted effort is required. I am very glad that, on this basis, and with EU support, we are launching the National Coordination Mechanism on Migration today to build a strong, tailor-made coordination platform for government.”
This launch is part of the third Cross-Regional Dialogue of Champion Countries of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) taking place from 28-30 November 2023 in Accra.
This work is supported by funding from the European Union under the Building Migration Partnerships Programme implemented by the International Organization for Migration, as Coordinator and Secretariat of the UN Network on Migration. Since its launch in February 2023 the programme has contributed to streghten the UN Network on Migration, the evidence base on migration through a comprehsnive needs assement and a mapping of migration governance stakehdolers.

Title: Businesses call for a review of key policies and initiatives towards economic stability
Content: 31 October 2023
Results from Ghana’s 2024 pre-budget survey show businesses look forward to the budget considering initiatives that review certain tax policies and reduce inflation to lessen economic impacts. The findings also call for the need to invest in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those relating to education, health, and economic prosperity to leave no one behind.
The pre-budget survey results were released by KPMG and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ghana. The survey solicited views from businesses across several industries on the impact of existing policies on their businesses and provided key recommendations to the Government through the Ministry of Finance to be considered in the upcoming budget and subsequent budget cycles. The national budget remains a key policy document for the implementation of various policy reforms and other policy measures in the country.

“We hope the insights from the survey will help Government in their deliberations and provide valuable contributions in the lead-up to the 2024 Budget”, noted Anthony Sarpong, Senior Partner at KPMG Ghana.

Key highlights and recommendations from the pre-budget survey includes the following:

Economic Factors: The findings reveal high inflation rate and cedi depreciation as key economic factors significantly affecting business performance and profitability. The results show about 5 in 10 businesses citing the negative impacts of these factors on the growth of their business. Other economic challenges cited by the respondents include rising interest rates, restricted access to financial resources, difficulties in retaining skilled labour, power supply constraints, and supply chain disruptions. The respondents suggest the need for the 2024 national budget to consider initiatives that reduce corruption, inflation, and interest rates; improve the performance of the local currency; and restore confidence in the economy.

Taxes: Respondents of the survey felt the current tax environment is adversely impacting their businesses. The top five taxes businesses want to be revised are the e-levy, COVID-19 levy, import levies, petroleum levy, and growth and sustainability levy. The survey recommends broadening of the tax base; rationalization of Government expenditures; and a comprehensive review of some of the Government’s flagship programmes such as the free Senior High School (SHS).

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The survey results show a growing demand for SDG-focused governance and resource allocation strategies, with about 8 in 10 respondents supporting Government incorporation of SDGs into the budget formulation. In the 2024 budget priorities, Quality Education, Good Health, and No Poverty are identified as the top three SDGs to be prioritized.

“Evidence suggests that economic growth is an enabler for the SDGs in the short term and over time the SDG agenda itself becomes a catalyst for inclusive economic growth. UNDP will continue to work as part of the UN family in Ghana and with other development partners, to support SDG aligned investment and financing by public and private sector to advance SDGs implementation to leave no one behind”, noted Angela Lusigi, UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana.

Growing Interest in Sustainability: The survey reveals an increasing recognition of the importance of integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations in shaping public policies and resource allocation. In addition, businesses highlighted the importance of having dedicated funds for climate initiatives and call for accelerated actions to address environmental degradation particularly in areas like illegal mining.

Preferred Policies:  In terms of policies, businesses want to see the 2024 Government budget prioritizing policies that promote local businesses and export through industrialization, agriculture development, and infrastructure development.

The highlights of the findings from the pre-budget survey provide evidence for the 2024 budget to consider prioritizing policies that promote inclusive green growth and sustainable development.

Title: UNOPS and UN Women claim rural areas with equal opportunities for all.
Content: 10 October 2023
To mark International Rural Women’s Day, UNOPS and UN Women will launch a campaign to call for action to empower women in rural areas so they are better equipped to contribute to food security and climate change adaptation in their communities.
Accra, 10 October 2023 ― UNOPS and UN Women are marking International Rural Women’s Day by launching a joint campaign to underline the contribution of rural women to development in Africa and highlight the importance of investing in gender-sensitive infrastructure that will allow them to better contribute to food security and climate adaptation.

The objective of the campaign is to call policy and decision-makers, societies, and international partners to action to support gender-responsive infrastructure in Africa that can empower rural women to access productive resources and opportunities, accelerate their socio-economic mobility, and boost gender contribution to climate adaptation and food security.

The campaign will include joint activities in several African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, among others. These events will be supported by a social media campaign in UNOPS and UN Women regional and national channels in Africa.

On 13 October at 8.30am Accra time, UN Women Africa and UNOPS Africa will be hosting a live conversation (which will be livestreamed on the UNOPS Africa X page), where stakeholders ―including Ifeoma Charles-Monwuba, Director Director/Representative of UNOPS Ghana Multi-Country (Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone) and the host of Ghanaian Farmer Enyonam Manye, among others ― will highlight the importance of addressing persistent gender gaps in the response to climate change and food insecurity.
UNOPS Director a.i. for Africa Region, Dalila Gonçalves, said: “Gender-blind infrastructure limits women’s access to financial resources, land, education, health, and other rights and opportunities. Also, it limits their capacity for coping with and adapting to climate change impacts. Women can play an active role as change-makers and educators in embedding sustainability within different infrastructure sectors. Supporting the empowerment of rural women through gender-responsive infrastructure, UNOPS helps low and middle-income countries across Africa in their journey toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.”

UN Women Regional Director for East and Southern Africa and Regional Director a.i for West and Central Africa, Maxime Houinato, said: “Rural African women's pivotal role in bolstering regional economies and combating poverty is irrefutable. Yet, they grapple with pronounced challenges in securing vital agricultural resources, restricting their agricultural productivity and impacting their adaptability to climate change. UN Women studies reveal that gender disparities in agriculture have a direct impact on the economic growth of countries ranging from 13 to 28 per cent of GDP, equivalent to annually elevating 80,000 to 238,000 individuals above the poverty line per country. It's imperative that we advance programmes and policies that increase financing for rural women’s access to labour and time-saving equipment and services, fostering gender equality and improving rural women’s economic security."

According to UN Women, women make up more than 50 percent of Africa’s population and 80 percent of them reside in rural areas. The International Labour Organization states that giving women the same opportunities as men could raise agricultural production by 2.5 to 4 percent in the poorest regions and reduce the number of malnourished people by 12 to 17 percent.
The UNOPS Report, ‘Infrastructure for gender equality and the empowerment of women’, stated that in rural areas inadequate infrastructure services disproportionately affect women’s time use because they bear the burden of household tasks, like collecting water and firewood, cooking, cleaning, and providing childcare. This limits the time available for pursuing educational, economic, or social activities.

Women also face disadvantages when it comes to land and livestock ownership or equal pay which hamper their productivity and growth, resulting in weak rural economies, and impacting the local and global food systems and climate adaptation capacity.

Title: 2023 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial provides important opportunity to fill critical gaps and strengthen UN Peacekeeping
Content: 22 September 2023
Ghana to host the 2023 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial, the first to be held in Africa.
The United Nations Secretariat and the Republic of Ghana have announced that the 2023 UN Peacekeeping Ministerial meeting will take place in Accra, Ghana on 5-6 December.
At a press conference in New York, Ghana's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, together with senior United Nations officials, said this flagship biennial meeting will help secure much-needed political support and generate pledges to strengthen UN Peacekeeping, in line with Action for Peacekeeping and A4P+, the implementation strategy for 2021-2023. This will be the fifth UN Peacekeeping Ministerial meeting and the first to take place in Africa.
UN Peacekeeping Ministerial meetings focus on securing concrete commitments from Member States to fill critical gaps, leverage new technologies, and address key priorities to improve the operational effectiveness of peacekeeping missions.
With missions navigating unprecedented challenges and threats, this year’s event will focus on critical issues such as the protection of civilians, strategic communications and addressing misinformation and disinformation, safety and security, mental health of uniformed peacekeepers, and the pivotal role of women in peacekeeping.
“As a long-standing Troop and Police Contributing Country to UN Peacekeeping since the 1960s, Ghana acknowledges the long and positive track record of peacekeeping in Africa and believes that UN Peacekeeping has a future and remains indispensable and invaluable in advancing peace in conflict settings globally. It is therefore pertinent that the world remains resolute in our commitment to guarding jealously this multilateral tool and fully support the Secretary-General’s initiatives such as the Action for Peacekeeping and A4P+ which are essential to improving the effectiveness of modern-day peacekeeping and tackling the security challenges of our time,” said Ghana's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey.
“UN peacekeeping is a global partnership with peacekeepers from over 120 countries deployed in some of the most challenging places in the world to help save lives, prevent conflict, and create conditions for lasting peace,” said Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations. “The 2023 Ministerial is an important opportunity for leaders to reaffirm their commitment and make pledges to UN peacekeeping, which remains one of the most significant multilateral tools to achieve sustainable peace and development. We are grateful to Ghana for hosting this Ministerial meeting and for their critical contributions to strengthening our operations.”
Member States are also being encouraged to create or strengthen bilateral and triangular support and partnerships to ensure proposed improvements are sustainable and have the required impact.
Highlighting the significance of the Ministerial taking place in Africa and the importance of partnerships, Atul Khare, Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support said “Ghana and Africa’s contributions to peacekeeping are advancing beyond troop contributions to offering a vital forum in which countries can unite and collaborate on innovative strategies to address current challenges and discuss the future of peacekeeping. I look forward to the formation of partnerships amongst participants to enhance the effectiveness of our peacekeepers, elevate the quality of their medical care, and foster environmentally responsible operations.”
“In addition to the myriad challenges currently before us, United Nations peace operations are also at a critical juncture in preventing and addressing misconduct as a central element of performance,” said Catherine Pollard, Under-Secretary-General for Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance. “This is a collective endeavour”.
The meeting in Accra is the latest in a series of high-level events that have enabled world leaders to pledge resources to help missions fully implement their mandates. Beyond garnering political support for the work of UN Peacekeeping, generous contributions by Member States at similar meetings in New York, London, Vancouver and Seoul have helped generate rapidly-deployable military units, key aviation assets, better medical capacities, and helped advance the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda.
In the lead-up to this year’s Ministerial, a series of preparatory meetings on key areas identified by UN Member States have set the stage for discussions. These included Preparatory Conferences on Women in Peacekeeping Operations, co-hosted by Bangladesh, Canada, and Uruguay, mental health support for uniformed personnel, co-hosted by Ghana, the Republic of Korea, and the United Nations, and safety and security, co-hosted by Japan and Pakistan. In October, a meeting on Protection of Civilians and Strategic Communications will take place in Kigali, co-hosted by Indonesia, the Netherlands, Rwanda, and the UK.

The plead follows a 5-day meeting of over 120 women and young people to discuss the current political crisis in the Sahel, the development and proposal of concrete strategies for greater involvement of women and young people in current and future political dialogue, and the development of joint regional programs.
The United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), in cooperation with UN Women, organized the annual meeting of the Working Group on Women, Youth, Peace and Security in West Africa and the Sahel, from 18 to 22 September 2023, under the theme "Unconstitutional seizure of power and transition in the Sahel region".
Nearly 121 women and young people (54 in person and 67 online) from 17 countries in West Africa and the Sahel took part in the meeting, which opened in the presence of Major General Francis Adu-Amanfoh, Special Advisor to the President of the Republic of Ghana on the Accra Initiative, Ms Francisca Atuluk, Director of Human Resources at the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Mr. George Amoh, Executive Secretary of the National Peace Council, and Mr. Charles Abani, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations System in Ghana. The officials recalled that UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) was the first to highlight the valuable role and essential contribution of women to peace and sustainable stability, recognizing that "women matter for peace". "Similarly, resolution 2250 (2015) on youth, peace and security recognizes the positive contribution of young people to peace and sustainable development in their communities, humanitarian assistance and post-conflict reconstruction." They also discussed the current security situation in the Sahel.
The 5-day meeting discussed the current political crisis in the Sahel, the development and proposal of concrete strategies for greater involvement of women and young people in current and future political dialogue, and the development of joint regional programs. Participants also discussed the synergies to be developed, coordination, partnership and better planning of their actions in line with the priorities identified. It also provided an opportunity for capacity-building in information and communication technologies.
The Working Group members also took part in the commemoration of the International Day of Peace organized by the Ghanaian chapter of the Working Group. The event underlined the urgent need for women and young people to be meaningfully involved in decision-making at all levels.
In addition, the various sessions that punctuated this annual meeting enabled Working Group members to adopt terms of reference for the establishment of a Rapid Response Team, and to formulate a series of pertinent recommendations that were the subject of a Position Statement on unconstitutional powers and the absence of women and young people from peace efforts in West Africa and the Sahel.
Working Group on Women, Youth, Peace and Security in West Africa and the Sahel is a coordination mechanism for the implementation of Resolutions 1325 (2000) and 2250 (2015), and an inclusive, multi-actor platform where women and youth become actors in conflict prevention and peacebuilding. The Working Group is coordinated by UNOWAS and UN WOMEN.

Title: The European Union, the Government of Ghana and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization launch 10 million Euro project to address food security in Northern Ghana
Content: 19 September 2023
15 September 2023, Accra – The European Union (EU), the Government of Ghana (GoG) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have launched a 10 Million Euro project to support vulnerable populations grappling with food insecurity in Ghana's northern regions. More than 50,000 people will benefit from the 3-year project.
The EU-funded, FAO-led project will be strategically concentrated in the northern regions of Ghana, where it aims to achieve the following outcomes:
This vital financial contribution by the EU reaffirms the importance of international solidarity in addressing global food security challenges aggravated by Russia aggression against Ukraine. It reflects the shared commitment to ensuring food security, reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development in Ghana.
EU ambassador to Ghana, Irchad Razaaly said: "This 10 million Euro emergency measure has been mobilized in record time and represents the commitment and solidarity of the EU and its Member States in the face of rising cost of food and to safeguard food security and transitioning to more resilient food systems in Ghana."
"The joint collaboration between FAO, the European Union and the Government of Ghana shows our commitment to rural families in Ghana and ending hunger and malnutrition while supporting the transition to more sustainable agrifood systems," said Yurdi Yasmi, FAO Deputy Regional Representative for Africa and Representative in Ghana.
The allocated funds will primarily focus on the sustainable development of crucial agribusiness value chains, including maize, millet, sorghum, groundnut, vegetables (tomatoes), poultry and piggery. These efforts complement the Government of Ghana's initiatives, such as Planting for Jobs Phase 2, to mitigate the adverse impacts of rising food, fertilizer, and fuel prices in vulnerable areas, in order to help alleviate poverty, hunger and malnutrition.
"The Government appreciates the EU and over ever reliable partner, the FAO, coming in at the time when the need to refocus our food systems deliver on nutrition and resilience is being consummated into the Planting for Food and Jobs, Phase II programme," said Hon. Bryan Acheampong, Minister for Food and Agriculture.
Over three agricultural seasons, the EU-funded project aims to support at least 10,000 households, benefiting approximately 6,000 maize farmers, 2,400 millet farmers, and 4,200 sorghum farmers in targeted districts. Women, youth, and value chain actors will receive capacity-building support, access to post-harvest technologies, and training on climate change adaptation, market access, financial services, and pest and disease management.

Title: Ghana convenes a side event on accelerating actions and innovative financing for the SDGs at SDG Summit
Content: 19 September 2023
The Government of Ghana, in collaboration with the Governments of Uganda, Nigeria and Tonga, Copenhagen Consensus Centre, Hilton Foundation, IRC and the UN Ghana Country Team will hold a side event today, 19 September, at the SDGs Summit ongoing in New York.
The event seeks to outline catalytic actions and investments that can significantly accelerate progress towards the SDG targets.
The shocks from the COVID-19 Pandemic, Russia-Ukraine War and Climate Impact have plunged many Africa economies into crises, reversing the little progress made in achieving the SDGs. Today, it is estimated that developing countries need $4 trillion per annum to achieve the SDGs by 2030.  This is double of the SDG investment gap of $2.5 trillion required prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve the SDGs by 2030, developing countries must address the estimated SDG financial gap, which for Ghana stands at $43 billion per annum.
The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres recently called on G20 countries for an annual, additional SDG stimulus package of $500 billion to support the SDGs in poor countries. However, in the current global crises, increasing expenditure on the SDGs seem largely implausible.
This side event will discuss how the world and African countries such as Uganda and Ghana could reprioritize innovative interventions and approaches to achieve the SDG targets, with a focus on delivering best for each dollar spent.

Title: Africa suffers disproportionately from climate change
Content: 05 September 2023
Nairobi 4 September 2023 (WMO) – Africa is responsible for only a fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions but is suffering disproportionately from climate change. This is harming food security, ecosystems and economies, fueling displacement and migration and worsening the threat of conflict over dwindling resources, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

The State of the Climate in Africa 2022 report shows that the rate of temperature increase in Africa has accelerated in recent decades, with weather- and climate-related hazards becoming more severe. And yet financing for climate adaptation is only a drop in the ocean of what is needed.

More than 110 million people on the continent were directly affected by weather, climate and water-related hazards in 2022, causing more than US$ 8.5 billion in economic damages. There were a reported 5 000 fatalities, of which 48% were associated with drought and 43% were associated with flooding, according to the Emergency Event Database. But the true toll is likely to be much higher because of under-reporting.

“Africa is responsible for less than 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. But it is the continent which is the least able to cope with the negative impacts of climate change. Heatwaves, heavy rains, floods, tropical cyclones, and prolonged droughts are having devastating impacts on communities and economies, with increasing numbers of people at  risk,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.

“There are big gaps in weather observations in Africa and early warning services are woefully adequate. We are determined to close those gaps and ensure that life-saving early warnings reach everyone,” he said.

The report, produced jointly with the African Union Commission and Africa Climate Policy Centre of United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), was released during the Africa Climate Summit, which also saw the launch of the Early Warnings For All in Africa Action Plan. Kenya, which is hosting the summit, also released its State of the Climate in Kenya in 2022 report.

“Africa, like other regions, has come to terms with the reality that climate change is already happening. Left untamed, the coming decades and years would easily be characterized by severe climate-induced pressure on the continent’s economies, livelihoods and nature,” says H.E. Ambassador Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko, Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment at the African Union Commission.

“Given Africa’s high exposure, fragility and low adaptive capacity, the effects of climate change are expected to be felt more severely. People’s health, peace, prosperity, infrastructure, and other economic activities across many sectors in Africa are exposed to significant risks associated with climate change,” she writes in the report.

Agriculture is the mainstay of Africa’s livelihoods and national economies – supporting more
than 55% of the labor force. But its agricultural productivity growth has declined by 34% since 1961 due to climate change. This decline is the highest compared to what other regions of the world have experienced.

Projected annual food imports by African countries are expected to increase by about a factor of three, from US$ 35 billion to US$ 110 billion by 2025.

The level of loss and damage, and therefore the costs incurred, will depend on many factors, including the level of ambition of global mitigation actions and the level of investment in adaptation at the local level. In a 4 °C warming world, with strong regional adaptation, “residual damages” costs equivalent to 3% of Africa’s projected gross domestic product could be incurred annually by 2080.

The loss and damage costs in Africa due to climate change are projected to range between US$ 290 billion and US$ 440 billion, depending on the degree of warming, according to the UNECA’s African Climate Policy Centre.

Climate change and the diminishing natural resource base could fuel conflicts for scarce productive land, water, and pastures, where farmer-herder violence has increased over the past 10 years due to growing land pressure, with geographic concentrations in many sub-Saharan countries, according to the report.

The report, with an accompanying story map, is the result of a multi-agency effort. It includes input from the African Union Commission, the UN Economic Commission for Africa, and contributions from African National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, WMO Regional Climate Centres, specialized United Nations agencies, the African Development Bank, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, and numerous experts and scientists.


Key messages

Temperature: The average rate of warming in Africa was +0.3 °C/decade during the 1991–2022 period, compared to +0.2 °C/decade between 1961 and 1990. This is slightly above the global average. The warming has been most rapid in North Africa, which was gripped by extreme heat, fuelling wildfires in Algeria and Tunisia in 2022.

Rainfall: The Horn of Africa faced its worst drought in 40 years, with Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia particularly hard hit. The “triple-dip” La Niña was a substantial contributor. Five consecutive failed rainfall seasons reduced agricultural productivity and food security. In Somalia, almost 1.2 million people became internally displaced by the catastrophic impacts of drought on pastoral and farming livelihoods and hunger during the year. A further 512 000 internal displacements associated with drought were recorded in Ethiopia.

Many parts of the Sahel experienced significant flooding during the monsoon season, with Nigeria, Niger, Chad and the southern half of Sudan particularly affected.

Tropical Cyclones: The South Indian Ocean experienced an active tropical cyclone season despite an unusually late start. The Southern Africa region was hit by a series of tropical cyclones and tropical storms in the first months of 2022, leading to flooding and population displacement. There was little time for recovery between shocks in nations like Madagascar.

Sea-level rise: The rate of coastal sea-level rise in Africa is similar to the global mean value of 3.4 mm/year. It is, however, slightly higher than the global mean along the Red Sea (3.7 mm/year) and along the western Indian Ocean (3.6 mm/year).

Climate Adaptation: Per capita emissions of carbon dioxide in Africa in 2021 were 1.04 metric tons per person, compared with the global average of 4.69 metric tons per person.

More than 50 African countries have now submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Agriculture and food security, water, disaster risk reduction, and health are the top priorities for adaptation.

Implementing Africa’s NDCs will require up to US$ 2.8 trillion between 2020 and 2030. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has doubled its climate finance to US$ 25 billion by 2025 and devoted 67% of its climate finance to adaptation, in addition to its effort to raise up to US$ 13 billion for its Africa Development Fund.

Title: UNIDO holds 2nd Ghana International Cluster Conference showcasing innovations of industrial clusters in the cosmetics, fruits & cassava value chain
Content: 23 August 2023
ACCRA, 22nd August 2023 - The 2nd Ghana International Cluster Conference attended by over 200 cluster experts, industrial experts, SMES and support institutions across Africa has ended in Accra with calls for a more strengthened business clusters across the ECOWAS region and use of cluster development methodology for integration in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
The conference, organized by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the European Union and the Ministry of Trade and Industries (MoTI) on the theme “Ghanaian Clusters, A Driving Force for the Economy”, showcased innovations and successful results in the fruits, cosmetics and cassava value chains targeted by the West African Competitiveness Programme.
Hon. Mr. KT Hammond, Minister of Trade and Industry, in a speech read on his behalf by the Chief Director, Mr. Yaw Nimo said: “Government has prioritized key sectors reflecting Ghana’s commitment to restoring the economy on an irreversible growth path through transformative agriculture, trade, and industry.”
He commended UNIDO and EU for the quality delivery and coordination they have demonstrated over the years working with the Government of Ghana to promote cluster development, industrial competitiveness and economic integration. He highlighted the excellent cooperation with MoTI and the precious support to the government’s “10 points Industrial Transformational Agenda”, with a special emphasis on the One District One Factory, Export Development Programme, Enhancing Domestic Retail Infrastructure and Development of SMEs to impart Government’s objective of job creation.
Mr. Stavros Papastavrou, UNIDO Representative in Ghana and Liberia, praised the joint implementation effort of Government of Ghana, EU and UNIDO. He said “What WACOMP-Ghana has done is to prove that MSMEs do not need much to contribute to the economic growth of West Africa. What is needed is fair markets, fair trade, and access to finance on fair conditions. I am particularly happy for the Government of Ghana and the European Union for successfully implementing the UNIDO Cluster Development Methodology in the cassava, cosmetics and tropical fruits value chains”.
Mrs. Ebe Muschialli, UNIDO Industrial Development Expert and WACOMP- Ghana Project Manager highlighted: “The joint commitment of UNIDO and the Government of Ghana have helped the supported Clusters and SMEs members to be more competitive to enter the international market. We are proud of the SMEs we have been working with over the past years, as they have gone a long way. They are producing new and more attractive products, that are compliant with international standards. They are now equipped to promote Ghanaian products in Africa and around the world.”
Dr. Charles Kwame Sackey the Chief Technical Advisor of WACOMP- Ghana confirmed clusters are successful drivers for enterprise development, innovation and regional competitiveness and UNIDO considers it to be an efficient policy instrument for entrepreneurship and economic development.
The WACOMP-Ghana has supported over 43,000 actors including primary producers and SMEs.

Title: UNFPA Celebrates World Population Day & Launches 2023 State of the World Population Report
Content: 11 July 2023
Annually, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) commemorates World Population Day with Governments, Civil Society, NGOs and Youth groups to bring attention to pertinent issues faced by people in the world.
This year, the World Population Day will be used to highlight the need to advance gender equality to help realise the dreams of all the 8 billion people on our planet.  This year, the United Nations system in Ghana, UNFPA Ghana Country Office, together with the National Population Council, the Regional Institute for Population Studies (RIPS), University of Ghana and the Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG), will be commemorating the World Population Day under the theme: “Unleashing the power of gender equality to spur national development”
As part of this year’s commemoration, there will also be the launch of UNFPA’s flagship 2023 State of theWorld Population (SWOP) Report. The SWOP Report guides policy-making, advocacy, programming, research, monitoring and evaluation of our world's development agenda. The 2023 SWOP report is entitled "8 billion lives, infinite possibilities, the case for rights and choices" and it provides an in-depth analysis of the demographic trends affecting sustainable development worldwide. The report explores the possibilities the 8 billion people offer the world and examines the challenges that must be overcome to achieve this demographic dividend, including the need for holistic sexual and reproductive health services, investments in education, job training, and gender equality. It stresses that investments in these areas are critical for sustainable development, human rights, and social justice.
The growth of the global population has also been in sync with the increase in Ghana’s population growth from about 24 million people in 2010 to about 32 million people following the first digital population census by the Ghana Statistical Service which UNFPA supported in 2021. Young people and adolescents account for more than 56% of Ghana’s population and the population of women and girls are far more than 50% of the total population. As a situation, it calls for the Government to invest in their health and education, while providing them opportunities for decent work so that they can contribute to economic growth and overall social development.
Key Facts and Figures from the 2023 State of World Population:
● Twenty-four per cent of partnered women and girls are unable to say no to sex and 11 percent are unable to make decisions specifically about contraception, according to data from 68 reporting countries.
● A survey showed that people who had been exposed to media or conversations about the world’s population were more likely to view the global population as being too high.
● Global demographics are changing rapidly: two thirds of people are living in low fertility contexts, while eight countries will account for half of the projected growth in global population by 2050 (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania), dramatically reordering the world’s ranking of most populous countries.
● Blaming fertility for climate change will not hold the greatest carbon emitters to account. Out of 8 billion people, around 5.5 billion do not make enough money, about $10 a day, to contribute significantly to carbon emissions.
● A recent UN study stipulates that greater gender parity in the labour force would do more to sustain economies in ageing, low-fertility societies than setting targets for women to have more children.

Title: The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023: Special Edition
Content: 11 July 2023
The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023: Special Edition provides a powerful call to action, presenting a candid assessment of the SDGs based on the latest data and estimates.
While highlighting the existing gaps and urging the world to redouble its efforts, the report also emphasizes the immense potential for success through strong political will and the utilization of available technologies, resources, and knowledge. Together, the global community can reignite progress towards achieving the SDGs and create a brighter future for all.
According to the report, the impacts of the climate crisis, the war in Ukraine, a weak global economy, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed weaknesses and hindered progress towards the Goals. The report further warns that while lack of progress is universal, it is the world’s poorest and most vulnerable who are experiencing the worst effects of these unprecedented global challenges.
It also points out areas that need urgent action to rescue the SDGs and deliver meaningful progress for people and the planet by 2030.

Title: 25 countries halved multidimensional poverty within 15 years, but 1.1 billion remain poor
Content: 11 July 2023
Clear progress has been made, though full impact of COVID-19 pandemic remains to be seen.
The latest update of the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) with estimates for 110 countries was released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) at the University of Oxford. The report demonstrates that poverty reduction is achievable. However, the lack of comprehensive data over the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges in assessing immediate prospects.
The analysis of trends from 2000 to 2022 focusing on 81 countries with comparable data over time, reveals that 25 countries successfully halved their MPI values within 15 years, showing rapid progress is attainable. These include Cambodia, China, Congo, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Morocco, Serbia, and Viet Nam.
Notably, India saw a remarkable reduction in poverty, with 415 million people lifted out of poverty within a span of just 15 years (2005/6–19/21). Also, large numbers of people were lifted out of poverty in China (2010– 14, 69 million) and Indonesia (2012–17, 8 million).
Countries halved their MPI in periods as short as four to 12 years, demonstrating the feasibility of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of halving poverty according to national definitions within 15 years. Thus, it is crucial to consider context-specific multidimensional poverty indices that reflect national definitions of poverty, since the global MPI assesses multidimensional poverty with the same methodology.

Ghana
The most recent survey data that were publicly available for Ghana’s MPI estimation refer to 2017/2018. Based on the estimates, about 8 million people (24.6 percent of the population in Ghana) in 2021 is multidimensionally poor. In additional, about 6.5 million Ghanaians (20.1 percent) is classified as vulnerable to multidimensional poverty in 2021. The intensity of deprivations in Ghana, which is the average deprivation score among people living in multidimensional poverty, is 45.1 percent. This means that close to half of the population (45%), is either multidimensionally poor or vulnerable to it.
“It is difficult to see the real poverty picture post-COVID, but the available data used for this multidimensional poverty index shows Ghana was making progress towards poverty reduction. It is important to consolidate the gains made over the period and accelerate recovery efforts to ensure no one is left behind”, noted Angela Lusigi, UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana.
Despite the global encouraging trends, the lack of post-pandemic data for most of the 110 countries covered by the global MPI restricts our understanding of the pandemic's effects on poverty.
Pedro Conceição, Director of the Human Development Report Office, observed, "As we reach the mid- point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we can clearly see that there was steady progress in multidimensional poverty reduction before the pandemic. However, the negative impacts of the pandemic in dimensions such as education are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. It is imperative that we intensify efforts to comprehend the dimensions most negatively affected, necessitating strengthened data collection and policy efforts to get poverty reduction back on track."
Judging from the few countries where data were solely collected in 2021 or 2022 – Mexico, Madagascar, Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria – momentum on poverty reduction may have persisted during the pandemic. Cambodia, Peru, and Nigeria showed significant reductions in their most recent periods, offering hope that progress is still possible. In Cambodia, the most encouraging case among these, the incidence of poverty fell from 36.7% to 16.6%, and the number of poor people halved, from 5.6 million to 2.8 million, all within
7.5 years, including pandemic years (2014–2021/22).
However, the full impacts globally remain to be measured. With a renewed emphasis on data collection, we need to broaden the picture to include the impacts of the pandemic on children. In over half of the countries covered, there was either no statistically significant reduction in child poverty or the MPI value fell more slowly among children than among adults during at least one period. This suggests that child poverty will continue to be a pressing issue, particularly in relation to school attendance and undernutrition.
"The astonishing scarcity of data on multidimensional poverty is hard to comprehend, let alone justify. The world is reeling under a data deluge and gearing up for the next era of digital growth. Yet we do not have a post-pandemic line of sight for 1 billion of the 1.1 billion poor people” says Sabina Alkire, Director of OPHI at the University of Oxford: “This problem is eminently solvable – data on multidimensional poverty are faster to gather than most realize – requiring just 5% of questions in the surveys we use. We call on funders and data scientists to make a breakthrough on poverty data, so the interconnected deprivations that strike poor people in real time can be tracked – and intercepted."
The global MPI both monitors poverty reduction and informs policy, showing how people experience poverty in different aspects of their daily lives – from access to education and health, to living standards such as housing, drinking water, sanitation, and electricity. The MPI as a poverty index can be pictured as a stacked tower of the interlinked deprivations experienced by poor individuals, with the aim of eliminating these deprivations.
According to the 2023 release, 1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people (just over 18%) live in acute multidimensional poverty across 110 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa (534 million) and South Asia (389 million) are home to approximately five out of every six poor people.
Nearly two-thirds of all poor people (730 million people) live in middle-income countries, making action in these countries is vital for reducing global poverty. Although low-income countries constitute only 10% of the population included in the MPI, these are where 35% of all poor people reside.
Children under 18 years old account for half of MPI-poor people (566 million). The poverty rate among children is 27.7%, while among adults it is 13.4%. Poverty predominantly affects rural areas, with 84% of all poor people living in rural areas. Rural areas are poorer than urban areas across all regions of the world.
The MPI sheds light on the complexity of poverty – where different indicators contribute to people's experience of poverty differently, varying from region to subnational region, and between and within communities. Ensuring that the data on global poverty is up-to-date and comprehensive is a crucial first step in addressing these challenges and maintaining progress towards a more equal world.

Title: UN launches campaign, calling for renewed global ambition and action for the Sustainable Development Goals
Content: 05 July 2023
Public mobilization comes ahead of critical halftime Summit in September at UN in New York.
Accra, Ghana; 5 July 2023 - The United Nations, today, is kicking off a global communications campaign to rally support and momentum for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap for people and planet adopted by world leaders in 2015. Ahead of a critical UN Summit in September, the campaign aims to amplify an urgent call for ambitious new action, showcase the Goals as the blueprint for sustainable progress globally, and galvanize the global public around this shared agenda for our common future.
At halftime toward the deadline of 2030, the promise of the SDGs is in peril. For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn and lingering COVID-19 effects.
The 2023 SDG Summit will gather world leaders at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 18-19 September to reaffirm their collective commitments to the Goals and the promise to leave no one behind. This Summit is a defining moment to urgently put the world back on track to achieving the SDGs, making bold and ambitious commitments.
As Ghana prepares to participate in the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development and the SDGs Summit, the United Nations is working closely with the Government of Ghana and relevant partners, including the National Development Planning Commission and development partners to reinforce Ghana’s participation and engagement, through the preparation of the Country report, which will highlight progress, challenges and catalytic commitments to put the country back on track – building on the learning from the 2022 Voluntary National Review, the ongoing Voluntary Local Review and other processes. The UN will support, with NDPC in the lead, this important stock take.
Starting today, in a major digital activation across platforms and countries worldwide, the UN campaign aims to re-energize the conversation about the Goals.
“For the first time in decades, development progress is reversing under the combined impacts of climate disasters, conflict, economic downturn, and lingering COVID-19 effects. Fast tracking catalytic priorities for SDGs implementation is our opportunity to restore the gains and forge ahead for a peaceful and just world” says the UN Resident Coordinator for Ghana, Mr. Charles Abani. “The world must embrace this campaign and recommit to a vision of the future that ensures no one is left behind. Already, with support from the UN, Ghana is putting together a stocktaking assessment to guide this important investment agenda” he added.
Building off the color wheel brand of the SDGs, the campaign uses a dynamic new visual system for its messaging to build momentum, raise awareness and mobilize accelerated action for the SDGs.
One core campaign component is the call to individual citizens to take action on the SDGs through the UN’s ActNow initiative across all 17 Goals. From using public transportation, to fundraising for schools or speaking up for equality, the platform lists steps that everyone can take to accelerate progress on the SDGs and create better lives on a healthier planet for all.
A curated group of high-profile influencers, the Circle of Supporters, will galvanize their communities to take individual action on the SDGs and to impress upon decision-makers the urgency to act now.

Title: Youth unemployment is the most common driver of vulnerability to violent extremism and radicalisation in Northern Regions of Ghana – New UNDP Ghana Report
Content: 30 June 2023
A new UNDP study that analysed the drivers of vulnerability to violent extremism and radicalization in the five Northern Regions of Ghana revealed youth unemployment as the most common driver
The study, which adopted a mixed method approach for data collection including a survey of close to 1400 respondents, assessed specific vulnerabilities of individuals, groups, and communities to being radicalised towards eventual violent extremism.

The report titled “Vulnerability Assessment on the Threats of Violent Extremism and Radicalisation in Northern Regions of Ghana’, calls for targeted interventions to address the persisting socio-economic challenges and development gap that has generated a sense of exclusion, marginalization, and anger among the largely unemployed youth. According to the Ghana Statistical Service, the national youth unemployment rate for young adults of 15-24 years, is about 32.8 percent and in this age category, the average unemployment rates are much higher in some of the northern regions, with Upper East region having 39 percent, Savannah region 38.2 percent, and North East, 34.7 percent.
“The peace Ghana enjoys cannot be taken for granted. It requires diligence and sustained efforts by state and non-state actors based on evidence. This collaborative research, and collective intelligence has helped to co-create solutions with communities at risk. Now that we have the evidence, it is important to get our policies and programming right to prevent violent extremism”, noted Angela Lusigi, UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana.
Other major drivers and pathway to radicalism, according to the report, are political vigilantism, farmer-herder conflicts, and easy availability of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW). In addition, the report cited access to the internet and social media as another important factor influencing religious radicalization of the youth.
The report identified community engagement, interventions for vulnerable youth, efforts to counter online extremism, and attempts to deracialize through religious and other available forms of counselling, as catalysts for building resilience. It recommends youth empowerment, border security management, monitoring abuse of social media, and operationalization of Ghana’s counter-terrorism framework, as critical in addressing the threats of violent extremism and radicalisation in Ghana.
The study builds on UNDP’s pioneering global reports on the “Journey to Extremism in Africa: Pathways to Recruitment and Disengagement” in 2023 and the first "Journey to Extremism in Africa" report in 2017.

Title: Ghanaian peacekeeper selected as United Nations Military Gender Advocate of the Year 2022
Content: 22 May 2023
A Ghanaian peacekeeper serving with the United Nations Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNISFA) will receive the 2022 United Nations Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award.
Captain Cecilia Erzuah, 32, who has served in Abyei since March 2022 as the Commander of the Ghana Engagement Platoon, will receive the award from Secretary-General António Guterres during a ceremony marking the International Day of UN Peacekeepers on Thursday, 25 May 2023.
Created in 2016, the United Nations “Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award” recognizes the dedication and efforts of an individual military peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.
“Resolution 1325 reminds us that our women peacekeepers are not only supporting global peace and security. They are leading the way. By every measure, Captain Cecilia Erzuah of Ghana is one of those leaders,” said Secretary-General António Guterres. “On every front, Captain Erzuah’s work has set the standard for ensuring that the needs and concerns of women are reflected across our peacekeeping operations.”
Captain Erzuah expressed her gratitude for being selected to receive the prize which she called “an award for all of us,” referring to her platoon members.
An advocate for gender equality and community engagement, Capt. Erzuah made sure that her 22-strong platoon, composed equally of men and women, conducted regular patrols and outreach to local leaders as well as women’s and youth groups, to better understand and address community concerns and needs. Together with civilian UN colleagues, she also hosted discussions on domestic violence, gender equality and childcare. Those conversations resulted in an increase in the number of women enlisted in Community Protection Committees, which were initially male dominated. The engagement with community members led to improved early warning about threats of violence against civilians and broader security issues.
The monthly market walks she initiated with her battalion also contributed to build strong and enduring relationships between traders, local residents and the UN.
In January 2023, following a spike in community violence in Majbong, a village in southeast Abyei, Captain Erzuah’s platoon stepped up its presence, regularly checking on the plight of displaced people in the volatile area and enabling the Mission to provide necessary support. Community members, who had sought sanctuary from the fighting in the surrounding bush, gradually began returning to their homes in the village and women reported feeling much safer.  “The mixed patrols are (...) boosting the confidence of members of the community to go about daily activities safely,” said Deng Paul Mankuol, a traditional chief in Majbong.
Captain Erzuah is the first Ghanaian peacekeeper, and the first recipient from a contingent or a unit, to receive this prestigious award. Ghana is currently the largest contributor of women military peacekeepers to the United Nations with 375 now deployed.

Title: United Nations in Ghana reaffirms strong partnership with and support for the Government and people of Ghana
Content: 28 April 2023
United Nations in Ghana and the Government of Ghana have signed a new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2023-2025, outlining the UN development system’s integrated contributions towards achieving Ghana’s vision for its development as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2063 in Ghana.
The Cooperation Framework signals a UN that is supporting Ghana on its WISER (Wealthy, Inclusive, Sustainable, Empowered, and Resilient) journey towards self-reliance.

Title: World Health Organization turns 75 On World Health Day
Content: 07 April 2023
Today, on World Health Day, World Health Organization (WHO) celebrates its 75th anniversary. In 1948, countries of the world came together and founded WHO to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable – so everyone, everywhere can attain the highest level of health and well-being.
Working with 194 Member States across six regions and on the ground in more than 150 offices, WHO envisions a world where Health for All is realized. The right to health is a basic human right that promotes health and wellbeing, dignity, and a good quality of life for everyone, despite who they are, where they live or what they do.
In Ghana, WHO has supported the country with technical and financial support in building a resilient health system that is capable of withstanding shocks. WHO has also extended support in the fight against diseases, leading to the interruption of Wild poliovirus as well as the elimination of Guinea worm, Trachoma, Human African Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and Neonatal Tetanus as public health problems. The organization has also assisted the country in the development of strategic documents such as the National Action Plan for Health Security, National strategy on non-communicable diseases including Mental Health, Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan for the Expanded Programme on Immunization and the National Innovative Health Financing Strategy.
“WHO’s 75th anniversary is an opportunity for us to reflect on the remarkable achievements of our collective efforts to advance the health and wellbeing of the people of Ghana,” says Dr Francis Kasolo, WHO Representative in Ghana. “It is also the chance for us to rally around a common agenda and strengthen our commitment to tackle emerging health challenges towards achieving health for all.”
At the heart of ‘health for all’ is the attainment of Universal Health Coverage through primary health, where people can have access to affordable, equitable, good quality and sustainable health care. In Ghana, around 36.2% of health expenditure comes out of people’s pockets and as a result, significant number of persons continue to be pushed further below the poverty line due to spending on health. National health strategies should therefore position primary health care as the entry point into a health system which not only treats ill health, but also prevents illness and promotes good health thus reducing the need for more expensive curative service.
Although Ghana has made significant progress towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as demonstrated in the improvement of the country’s UHC service coverage index from 35 in 2010 to 47.8 in 2021, it is important that these gains are consolidated by adhering to Ghana’s UHC roadmap.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled back the hard-won gains made in areas such as routine immunization against vaccine-preventable childhood diseases and antenatal attendance. In the past three years an estimated 21 million children have not received a single vaccine dose. In 2021 alone, the world recorded the worst decline in routine immunization in 30 years, and WHO estimates that without immediate action to catch up and get back to normal immunization coverage, the global immunisation figures will not return to pre Covid 19 levels until 2027.
In contrast to the global immunisation picture, in Ghana, 1.24 million children received the third dose of the Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus (DPT) containing vaccine in 2022 compared to the 1.17 million children who received the same vaccine in 2019. This remarkable performance was achieved through concerted support provided by WHO and other partners to sustain the delivery of essential services, including immunization.
As we celebrate WHO 75 anniversary, we remain committed to working with all stakeholders to support Ghana’s health sector priorities towards achieving the highest level of health for all Ghanaians.

Title: Chef Fatmata Binta leads FAO event to celebrate International Year of Millets in Africa
Content: 19 March 2023
Africa’s millet super foods can help address hunger and climate change.
At a special event at the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Regional Office for Africa, millets took centre stage and were celebrated for their potential in addressing climate change, boosting nutrition and increasing farmers’ incomes. The ‘Dine on a Mat’ event saw ambassadors, high-commissioners, government ministers, UN and development partners and other high-level guests take part in a dinner of fonio and other millets prepared by chef Fatmata Binta for the International Year of Millets 2023.

Chef Binta is an advocate for fonio – an ancient African super grain – and for supporting women fonio producers. She won the Basque Culinary World Prize in 2022 for her Dine on a Mat concept which brings together her Fulani cultural heritage and her culinary training.
“Millets have a lot of potential for agricultural transformation. If we can increase productivity, and add value along the supply chain through processing it will benefit those who are producing, especially a lot of women,” said FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa Abebe Haile-Gabriel at the event.
“Fonio is very easy to grow, you don’t need to plough the land too much, you can harvest within 8 to 12 weeks and it has so many benefits, so it is something we need to add to our diets,” said Chef Binta, who is collaborating with FAO throughout the International Year of Millets. “Right now we are talking a lot about sourcing loca, connecting with farmers, and I think it’s important now to start using ingredients that are underutilized – that’s the way forward,” she said.
The Ambassador of India to Ghana H.E. Sugandh Rajaram, whose country first proposed the international year to the United Nations, attended the event. Other guests included representatives from the Governments of Ghana, Australia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Italy, Japan, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Korea, Spain, Togo,  the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States of America’s USAID, the African Development Bank, the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), the Pan-African Agribusiness Apex Chamber (PAAC), the UN Resident Coordinator and the World Food Programme.
Fonio – a star from Africa
Fonio was the star ingredient at the Dine on a Mat event, including in a salad served with nuts and herbs. “I encourage everyone to use more millets, look for recipes online, and explore what you can do with these ancient super grains,” said Chef Binta.
Millets were among the first plants to be domesticated and have been an important food for hundreds of millions of people in Africa and Asia. They include sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, amaranth, fonio and teff.
These small grains are packed with minerals including iron, fibre, antioxidants and protein, have a low glycaemic index and are gluten-free. Despite their history and nutritional value, they account for less than 3 percent of the global grains trade.
Millets are a climate solution
Millets are climate-resilient crops because they can grow on arid lands with minimal inputs and maintenance, are tolerant or resistant to diseases and pests, and are more resilient to climate shocks than other cereals.
The residues from millet harvests are used as livestock feed and are an important adjunct to feed security, especially during harsh seasons such as drought.
Greater consumption of millets can offer opportunities to smallholder farmers through sustainable increased production. By promoting millets and regaining market opportunities, additional sources of revenue can be created for smallholders and in the food sector, boosting economic growth.
Governments and policy makers can prioritize the production and trade of millets, take legislative actions to promote their cultivation and innovative methods for harvest and post-harvest processes. Millets can also be put on the menu at public schools and hospitals.
The private sector can invest in the sustainable production of millets by facilitating access to credit or other financial support, millet-specific training, farming equipment and new technologies that improve the processing of millets. The food industry can increase production and promotion of millets-based products.
Everyone can promote and enjoy millets in their daily lives. As part of her collaboration with FAO, Chef Binta has launched a global Instagram Chefs Challenge that encourages chefs and any other passionate cooks to share a millet recipe using the hashtag #IYM2023.

Title: UNIDO, GEA AND JAPAN open application for its National Kaizen Initiative for MSMES
Content: 10 March 2023
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Ghana Enterprises Agency (GEA) have launched a call for application for its program aimed at scaling up Ghana’s national initiatives on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) promotion.
The call for proposal under the joint implementation of UNIDO and the GEA is part of activities of its $3.9 Million project “Expanding the Kaizen Initiatives by Enhancing Sustainable Agri-Business”, funded by the government of Japan to sustainably and continually improve quality and productivity of businesses in Ghana.
Mr. Marin Mizuno, UNIDO Project Manager, noted acquiring proper enterprise performance management skill is crucial to the sustanaibility of MSMEs and enterprsies growth.
Mr. Mizuno  said: “In this difficult time, the only control at our disposal is our own internal resources, which we can maximize to improve enterprise performance. And in this regard, I strongly believe that the Kaizen approach, which leverages on the efficiency of internal resources, is the perfect tool for MSMEs to cope with the current difficulties.”
He emphasised that UNIDO’s Smart and Sustainable Agri-business, an innovative enterprise performance management tool which leverages on digital solutions to productivity improvement will contribute to modernizing enterprise performance management in the MSMEs space.
Mr. Tetsuya Imaoka, Coordinator for Economic Cooperation of the Embassy of Japan  in Ghana revealed the philosophy of Kaizen is to improve the enterprise performance by maximizing the efficiency with the available resources, rather than resorting to huge capital investment.
Mr. Imaoka affirmed: “I believe Japanese technology, experience and wisdom through a variety of methodologies and approaches is exactly what is needed in Ghana, especially for micro, small and medium enterprises as we go through a very difficult time.”
Hon. Samuel Abu Jinapor, Caretaker Minister for the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Substantive Minister for the Minstry of Lands and Natural Resources said data from the registrar General’s Department of Ghana indicates that about 90% of businesses registered in Ghana are MSMEs.
He confrmed: “Micro, Small and Medium enterprises have been identified by Government as the means through which its Industrial Transformation Agenda and other development goals of the country can be realised and we are grateful to Japan for this support.”
Mrs. Kosi Yankey-Ayeh, the Chief Executive Officer of GEA stated that the project is going to stimulate the National Expansion drive for MSMEs with emphasis on production efficiency, food safety and compliance to make them more efficient and competitive.
Mrs. Yankey-Ayeh  added: “We are committed, prepared and well-positioned to partner with UNIDO to ensure the smooth commemncement and successful implementation of the Project”.
MSMEs who meet the selection requirement would be selected for Kaizen  and SSAB training. The selected MSMEs will also benefit from the capital investment component of the project.
The Call for Proposal for this program will be open until the 30th of April for the enterprises to apply. The selection will be duly conducted for the final nomination of the enterprises to be supported under the program.

Title: The UNFPA Ghana Country Office and partners observe the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation
Content: 06 February 2023
The UN in Ghana calls on the Government of Ghana through the Ministry of Gender, Children & Social Protection, development partners, traditional and religious leaders, and NGOs to join efforts to eliminate the harmful practice of FGM, and ensure the creation of safe environment for women and girls to live free of FGM.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) defines Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) as “a practice that involves altering or injuring the female genitalia for non-medical reasons.” The practice is internationally recognized as a gross violation of human rights and an estimated 200 million women and girls across the world have undergone some form of FGM.
At the global level, since 2008, UNFPA and UNICEF have been leading a joint programme to eliminate FGM in 17 countries. Annually in Ghana, the UNFPA Country Office has worked with the Ministry of Gender, Children & Social Protection, NGOs, traditional authorities, religious leaders, women and advocates to stem the tide of FGM in our communities.
In line with the global theme for observing this year’s International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM, we call on the Government of Ghana through the Ministry of Gender, Children & Social Protection, UN agencies, development partners, traditional and religious leaders, and NGOs to:
● Partner and engage men and boys to shift unequal power relations and challenge the
attitudes and behaviours caused by gender inequality leading to FGM.
● Change the social norms that perpetuate FGM.
● Invest in national and local-level policies to protect the rights of girls and women,
including the development of action plan to end FGM.
The UNFPA Ghana Country Office and its partners, including the Embassy of Norway in Ghana, will be observing the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM with a series of activities including a dialogue with men and boys on FGM and a durbar for sensitization of traditional leaders, particularly the male leaders to lead the charge to end FGM on Monday, February 6, 2023 at Pusiga in the Upper East Region.
Let us be reminded of the urgent need for more concerted efforts and investments to eliminate the harmful practice of FGM. We need men and boys to create safe environment for women and girls to live free of FGM including raising awareness about FGM, reporting cases of FGM, speaking up against the social norm that perpetuate FGM, and in supporting their sisters and daughters not to undergo FGM. We can all do our parts to protect the millions of girls and women at risk of FGM.

Content: 23 December 2022
The Honorable Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey has received credentials of the new Country Representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Dr. David Wilfred Ochan.
During the meeting, Hon. Minister Shirley Botchwey congratulated Dr. Ochan on his appointment and assuming duties in the Republic of Ghana. She welcomed him to the country and assured him of the Government’s commitment to continue collaborating with UNFPA to realise sexual and reproductive health for all. She stated that ‘the Government of Ghana is interested in tackling issues of adolescent pregnancy, maternal mortality and youth empowerment and thus, the Ministry will be committed to supporting the work of UNFPA in Ghana’.
Dr. Ochan appreciated the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration for its recent assistance in the approval of UNFPA 8th Country Programme (2023–2027), support with the ICPD+25 review processes and the on-going tracking systems with the NDPC.

Title: United Nations Network on Migration, EU and Government of Ghana Mark International Migrants Day with First Diaspora Dialogue
Content: 22 December 2022
The United Nations Network on Migration (UNNM), European Union (EU) and the Government of Ghana joined forces on Friday 16 December to commemorate the 2022 International Migrants Day in Accra, Ghana by hosting a ‘Diaspora Dialogue’. This Diaspora Dialogue was organized in collaboration with the Diaspora Affairs Office of the Office of the President at the Accra International Conference Centre.

Over 250 representatives from government, UN entities, EU, Ghanaian diaspora, and the private sector gathered, in-person and online, to explore innovative solutions to improve responses to challenges Ghanaian Diaspora encounter in their efforts to contribute to Ghana’s socio-economic development, including investment and job creation.
“While the diaspora is already making important contributions to the development of the country, this Dialogue is crucial to explore further which measures need to be put in place to allow the Diaspora to support the country in its economic recovery post-COVID-19, and especially against the reality of the current global crisis,” said Akwasi Awua Ababio, Director, Diaspora Affairs Office, Office of the President.
With December attracting hundreds of Ghanaians from the Diaspora to return home, the Diaspora Dialogue complements the Government’s ‘Beyond the Return’ initiative, which aims to acknowledge and enhance diaspora contribution to Ghana’s socio-economic development after the country saw a considerable number of Ghanaian and African diaspora coming to Ghana in 2019.
Head of Governance and Security at the EU Delegation to Ghana, Anna Lixi, said that the “Diaspora is a unique and often overlooked driver of investment and growth. The EU actively supports unlocking the potential vested in diaspora and migrant communities more generally, including through the EU-UN Building Migration Partnerships Programme.”
During the Dialogue, participants discussed how the diaspora could be empowered to contribute to the socio-economic development and creation of green jobs in Ghana. Representatives from the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC), Diaspora community, UNNM, including UNDP, UNCDF and IOM, Diaspora Affairs Office (DAO), identified gaps and recommendations that will serve as a basis for subsequent action by relevant stakeholders, including the UN. Key recommendations included enhancing quality of data, expediating the fomal adoption of the draft diaspora policy and, enhancing coordination among various government agecnies.
“The 2030 Agenda includes a pledge to ‘leave no one behind’, and to endeavour to reach the furthest behind as we deliver. Addressing migration and migrants issues will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,” said Charles Abani, UN Resident Coordinator in Ghana. “Enhancing migration governance through the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration will be essential. Ghana’s unique approach to involving the Diaspora will allow the country to build back better,” he added.
The Diaspora Dialogue is part of a wider effort to make migration work for the benefit of all – in line with the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM). Ghana was among the first champion countries that volunteered to increase advocacy and ownership on the GCM. The UN Network in Ghana, established in 2020, provides a space to advance planning around GCM implementation, monitoring and review. The Diaspora Dialogue was made possible with the support of the European Union funded project “EU-UN Building Migration Partnerships Programme” implemented by the UN Network in Ghana.

Title: Ghana: Toxics exposure violating human rights, urgent action needed, says UN expert
Content: 13 December 2022
At the end of his two-week fact-finding mission in Ghana, UN Special Rapporteur on toxics and human rights, Marcos Orellana, calls on the Government of Ghana to respect and guarantee the free and full exercise of human rights in the face of threats posed by toxic substances in the country.
“Ghana should be commended for its leadership at the international level in strengthening multilateral agreements in the chemicals and waste cluster, and it is also leading the African Group in negotiations toward a legally binding agreement on plastic pollution,” the Special Rapporteur on toxics and human rights, Marcos Orellana, said in a statement at the conclusion of a 14-day visit to the country
“At the same time, there is weak implementation of laws concerning chemicals and wastes at the national level. This puts individuals at risk of serious human rights violations,” the Special Rapporteur said.
The toxic impacts of mercury use in small-scale gold mining, hazardous pesticides, plastics and e-waste exposures are particularly concerning, Orellana said.
“Ghana is on the receiving end of a global economy that seeks to externalise the costs of waste generation on poor developing countries. The result is exposure of workers lacking protective equipment to the hazardous substances released in the dismantling and recycling of e-wastes.”
At Agbogbloshie, one the world’s largest e-waste dumpsites, thousands of people living and working there are exposed to high levels of hazardous substances. “For a meagre income, children are leaving their schools to burn electronic cables for the extraction of copper,” Orellana said.
“Mercury use in small-scale mining is contaminating soils and water sources at a national scale, compromising the rights of present and future generations.”
The expert said the Government’s National Action Plan on mercury is an important step but is not ambitious enough and does not include a phase-out date for mercury use.
“The Government should ban the trade and use in mercury, champion amendments to strengthen the Minamata Convention on mercury, and address mercury use as a form of environmental crime,” Orellana said.
Plastic waste also is not properly managed. Plastics are covering beaches and burning in informal dumpsites all over the country. The National Plastic Waste Management Policy is important but effective implementation is lacking, he said. “For instance, Ghana should consider banning single-use plastics, reducing volumes of production and establishing extended producer responsibility schemes.”.
Several of the pesticides used in Ghana, such as paraquat and chlorpyrifos, are banned for use in Europe because they are hazardous to human health and the environment. “It is also alarming that one of the most widely used pesticides in the country is glyphosate, which is ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer,” he said.
“I want to highlight the abhorrent double standards of countries that ban dangerous pesticides while allowing them to be produced and exported to developing countries. But Ghana also has a responsibility to protect the human rights of its population.”
Orellana said the adoption of the 2021 to 2030 Strategic Plan for the sound management of chemicals and waste was cause for optimism and can help strengthen institutions and norms. Similarly, Ghana can build on its successful experience in addressing PCBs, per requirements of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants.
“Ghana must take further steps to strengthen its legal framework and improve implementation and enforcement to guarantee the right to live in a clean, healthy and sustainable environment,” he said.
The Special Rapporteur will present a report with his findings and recommendations to the Human Rights Council in September 2023.

The UN Special Rapporteur on toxics and human rights, Marcos Orellana, will visit Ghana from 30 November to 13 December 2022 to assess the country’s human rights situation in relation to toxics and hazardous substances. The Special Rapporteur will visit at the invitation of the Government.
“I am particularly interested in identifying good practices and examining the use and management of chemicals and hazardous waste,” he said.
“The prevention from toxic exposure through the sound management of hazardous substances has direct consequences on the enjoyment of human rights, impacting people’s life, health and livelihood.”
In Ghana, the Special Rapporteur will visit sites affected by toxic substances and hold meetings with government authorities, civil society and other stakeholders.
The UN expert will hold a news conference on 13 December 2022 at 15:00 in Ghana Journalists Association premises (Ghana International Press Centre, Ringway, Accra, Ghana) to share his preliminary findings and recommendations. Access will be strictly limited to journalists.
The Special Rapporteur will present a comprehensive report with his findings and recommendations to the Human Rights Council in September 2023.

Title: Ghana authorizes transfer of mitigation outcomes to Switzerland
Content: 14 November 2022
Supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Ghana is the first country globally to launch a project and issue an authorization statement for the transfer of mitigation outcomes as part of cooperative approaches under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

The Government of Ghana has officially authorized the transfer of mitigation outcomes under its new climate-smart rice project to Switzerland. This was announced at a side event at the ongoing Climate Change Conference (COP 27) when the Government officially presented a formal authorization letter to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which has facilitated the bilateral agreement between Ghana and Switzerland.
The bilateral agreement falls under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, and this allows public and private institutions to collaborate to invest in climate change mitigation interventions in Ghana and exchange carbon credits with Switzerland for payment while maintaining the development benefits in the country.
“Ghana’s leadership in Africa on carbon finance with the landmark bilateral agreement with Switzerland is something we are proud of. We want to leverage this collaborative approach to crowd in more carbon revenue to accelerate the implementation of our national climate plan for the benefits of many communities”. said Dr. Kwaku Afriyie, Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI)
The authorization was in line with the guidance of cooperative approaches referred to in Article 6 paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement and Ghana’s Mitigation Framework for the Mitigating Activity titled “promotion of climate-smart agriculture practices for sustainable rice cultivation in Ghana”. The letter confirms that the Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) will represent mitigation from 2021 onward spanning through the implementation period of Ghana’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).
“I congratulate Ghana for formalizing its bilateral agreement with Switzerland to transfer carbon credit resulting from our project to promote climate smart agriculture in rice cultivation”, noted Dr Angela Lusigi, the UNDP Resident Representative in Ghana.
During the side event at the COP27, Ghana showcased how pioneering voluntary cooperation approaches under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement will enable the reduction of carbon emissions while advancing progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing countries.
Beyond emissions reductions, climate mitigation projects can indeed directly yield many development benefits–including job creation, support to livelihoods and food security. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement acknowledges that countries can pursue voluntary cooperation in the implementation of their climate plans known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to allow for higher mitigation ambition and to promote sustainable development.
The Ghana climate-smart rice project will support the training of over thousands of rice farmers – covering nearly 80 percent of Ghana’s rice production – in sustainable agricultural practices, leading to significant methane emission reductions. The intervention will also provide extra income through carbon revenue to farmers for increased resilience and improve efficiency of water use.

Title: UN in Ghana commits to support Ghana to realize its ambition to be self-reliant
Content: 26 September 2022
The United Nations in Ghana is committing at least $260 million (GHC2.6 billion) to support Ghana accelerate and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda 2063.  Through the UN’s Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, the UN in Ghana, represented by over 30 UN agencies, funds and programmes will focus on empowering people and institutions through capacity development and other areas, reaching the most vulnerable to ensure no one is left behind.

Title: Ghana Armed Forces receives funding from the Elsie Initiative Fund to increase the deployment of women to UN peacekeeping
Content: 01 September 2022
The Elsie Initiative Fund for Uniformed Women in Peace Operations (EIF) announced today that the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) will receive funding of USD 3.7 million over three years to substantially increase the number of military women who deploy into peacekeeping missions— including in command positions—and to transform the GAF to be more gender-inclusive. As the 7th highest contributor to United Nations peacekeeping, Ghana currently deploys 2,760 uniformed personnel, among which 15.6 per cent are women.
With the EIF grant, Ghana will increase its contribution of military women by deploying a Gender-Strong Unit (GSU)—a military battalion with substantial representation of women overall including in command positions—to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for three years and beyond.
“The inclusion of women at all levels of peace operations, through promotion of gender equality and awareness creation, is a clear and present reality, for the success of complex and multidimensional peace operations.” said the GAF’s Chief of Defence Staff, Vice Admiral Seth Amoama. “The approval of this will further enhance our pre-deployment preparations and deployment of female soldiers. It will also go a long way to improve our gender awareness and equality through targeted training and national awareness.” he added.
Through the EIF-funded project, Ghana will address two of the most challenging barriers to women’s meaningful participation, that were identified in a barrier assessment conducted in partnership with DCAF – the Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance (report) on the GAF, being limited pool of trained and qualified women to deploy as peacekeepers, and inadequate infrastructure for women.
Specifically, the GAF will partner with the Women Peace and Security Institute of the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre to launch a nation-wide campaign to address gender stereotypes and promote the recruitment and integration of women in leadership and combat roles. Through visits to Ghana’s 16 regional areas, the GAF will also conduct outreach activities to encourage young women in secondary and tertiary schools to be enlisted. The GAF will also build two accommodation facilities designed specifically for women recruits (total of 300 beds), which will enable more women to be recruited and trained for deployment to UN peace operations.
The UN Resident Coordinator in Ghana, Mr. Charles Abani commended Ghana’s role as the top contributor of uniformed women in military contingents to UN missions, and the project as an important milestone. “The EIF’s support will enable the GAF to continue transforming their institutional culture through an ongoing commitment to gender equality. We are pleased to know the GAF is committed to ensuring that the project’s impact is long lasting and is dedicated to proper preparation of their forces prior to deployment. The UN in Ghana welcomes Partners’ support, such as the EIF, which will render GAF’s contributions more efficient. The envisaged construction of dedicated women’s accommodation will enhance the positive strides the GAF is already taking to recruit, train and retain women in its armed forces and in peacekeeping,” he said.
Ghana has a history of including women in the military and was among one of the few countries in the world to enlist women as far back as 1959. The country has since adopted nation-wide policies to promote the meaningful inclusion of women in peace and security such as the National Gender Policy and Ghana’s National Action Plan 2 [2020-2025], on the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (GHANAP 2). Through its bilateral partnership with Canada under the Elsie Initiative, the GAF will receive technical assistance on developing policy and training to build a gender-sensitive institutional culture within the GAF.
UN Women’s Regional Director Ms. Oulimata Sarr said “We are proud to see that Ghana has made tremendous efforts in advancing gender equality. I commended Ghana’s efforts in incorporating and institutionalizing gender perspectives. We are pleased to see that this important project, funded by the Elsie Initiative Fund, will further contribute to the implementation of GHANAP 2020-2025, by supporting women’s participation at all levels in peacekeeping.”
This year, the EIF also funded a project to enable UNIFIL to build gender-sensitive accommodation for women peacekeepers (press release). The improved accommodation will support the first Ghanaian military GSU, to be deployed in September 2022.

As we celebrate the diverse heritage and culture of people of African descent and their enormous contribution to our societies throughout history, the UN Secretary-General, in his message to mark the Day, notes that “millions of people of African descent [around the world] are still subject to racism and deeply entrenched and systemic racial discrimination.”  This must stop.  The UN Secretary-General therefore calls for the full respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people of African Descent. Such violation of the rights of people of African descent must be redressed and formal apologies and reparations for the egregious wrongs of slavery and colonialism must be demanded.
In December, the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent, whose establishment is an important achievement of the International Decade for People of African Descent, will hold its first session.  The United Nations Secretary-General urges all stakeholders, including people, communities and organizations of African descent, to participate and drive the work of the Forum forward.

Title: Japan and UNIDO to Promote Kaizen Practices to Foster the Development of Ghanaian MSMEs in Sustainable AgriBusiness
Content: 18 July 2022
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Government of Japan have signed an agreement to enhance the competitiveness of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) for Ghana’s economic and social development.
Ghana has disseminated Kaizen – a Japanese methodology and philosophy for continuous quality and productivity improvement at the shop floor over the last decade. As such, hundreds of Ghanaian enterprises have introduced and still apply Kaizen practices, which helped them improve their performance. Still, to achieve a bigger national impact, the approach needs to be upgraded to sustainably improve the enterprises’ competitiveness.
Accordingly, with funding from the government of Japan and in coordination with the Ghana Enterprises Agency (GEA), UNIDO will implement its “Expanding the Kaizen initiative by enhancing sustainable agribusiness” project that, through the Organization’s digital dashboard system, will adress inter alia the economic performance, the resource efficiency, the environmental sustainability, and the social welfare of MSMEs.
Ultimately, the 3-year project will support Ghana in scaling up its national Kaizen initiative, and by extension enhance the performance of Ghanaian MSMEs.
The project will introduce “Smart and Sustainable Agri-Business (SSAB)” – an approach that collects key performance indicators to visualize the enterprises’ performance, also related to productivity, resource efficiency, food security/compliance and social welfare.
A pre-launch event was attended by Hisanobu Mochizuki, Japanese Ambassador to Ghana ,  Fakhruddin Azizi, UNIDO Representative to Ghana and Liberia and Charles Abani UN Resident Coordinator.

Content: 13 May 2022
Trade and investment promotion organizations around the world will meet in Accra on 17-18 May to explore Bold Solutions for Resilience and Recovery, the theme of this year’s conference.
The 2022 World Trade Promotion Conference (WTPO) will be hosted by the Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA) and the International Trade Centre (ITC), a development agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization that connects small business to global markets. It brings together 200 leaders of national trade promotion organizations from around the world.
In a press release issued today, the Executive Director of ITC, Pamela Coke-Hamilton, said "Good trade can drive socio-economic recovery that is inclusive and sustainable", adding that  "Trade promotion organizations can make all the difference in helping companies achieve good trade. They must help businesses to mitigate risks and embrace opportunities of a green transition. They must help women, youth and vulnerable groups join global value chains, and overcome systemic barriers that keep them from developing their businesses for export."

Title: The Return Mission: Ghana to host a high-level delegation to advance equity for People of African Descent
Content: 20 April 2022
A high-level forum will be held in Ghana as part of an initiative by the United Nations to advance the rights of people of African Descent by promoting recognition, justice and development. Convened by Dr. Natalia Kanem, UN Under-Secretary General, and Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the forum will be attended by the Vice-President of Ghana, His Excellency, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, as the Special Guest of Honour and Vice-President of Costa Rica, Her Excellency Epsy Campbell Barr, who will be delivering the keynote address.
Centred on the theme, "People of African Descent: Accelerating the Commitment for Recognition, Advancement of Rights, Justice and Development" the meeting is aimed at promoting dialogue and advocacy on thematic areas that would enhance inclusion and the wellbeing of People of African Descent. The forum which will be held on Friday, 22nd April 2022 precedes this year’s International Day for People of African Descent which will be observed on 31st August 2022.
The inaugural celebration of International Day for People of African Descent was hosted by the Government of Costa Rica in San Jose in August 2021. This followed a resolution adopted by the United Nations based on a proposal by Costa Rica to observe the day in recognition of the history, legacy and contributions of the African diaspora worldwide.
UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres described the day as "a celebration of the enormous contributions of people of African descent to every field of human endeavour," and "a long overdue recognition of the profound injustices and systemic discrimination that people of African descent have endured for centuries and continue to confront today."
The historic relationship Ghana shares with the African diaspora is significant, considering its central involvement in the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. This history, coupled with the recent ‘Year of Return’ and ‘Beyond the Return’ initiative by the Government of Ghana has positioned Ghana as a vital entry-point for Africans in the diaspora.
Visiting historic and cultural sites
To provide an experience of touristic sites that are indispensable to the history of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, the delegation will visit the Elmina Castle, Assin Manso Slave Market and Slave River Park.
Dr Natalia Kanem, UNFPA’s Executive Director is the UN Secretary-General's Champion to further the agenda of people of African heritage. While in Ghana, she is also expected to engage with traditional leaders by paying a courtesy call to the King of Akwamu, His Royal Majesty Odeneho Kwafo Akoto III.
Highlights of the upcoming events scheduled between 19th and 23rd April 2022 include: A High-level Forum on People of African Descent; a courtesy call to the President and the Vice-President of the Republic of Ghana and field visit to assess Nana Afrakuma II’s Vocational Institute for Adolescent Mothers in Akwamu.

Title: Financing Climate Resilient Infrastructure in Ghana to Safeguard Physical and Institutional Components of Ghana’s Infrastructure System
Content: 23 March 2022
Ghana is expected to experience more severe climate hazards such as flooding, as well as more frequent and intense droughts as a result of climate change. This has the potential to put years of progress toward growth and development targets at risk.
Building a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient infrastructure, therefore, is critical to delivering development benefits over the long term.

A new report outlining Ghana’s current and future needs for climate change adaptation, co-written by UNOPS, will be launched in Accra on 24 March 2022.  The Report, “Ghana: Roadmap for Resilient and Infrastructure in a Changing Climate” provides Ghana with a resilient infrastructure roadmap to help build a sustainable, inclusive and resilient infrastructure such as power distribution lines, homes, roads and drains.

Title: Ghana to host first-ever Kofi Annan Road Safety Award
Content: 14 March 2022
Leaving no one behind on the road is at the heart of the first Kofi Annan Road Safety Award, launching 16 March 2022 in Accra, Ghana, by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the Secretariat of the United-Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Road Safety, and the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Ghana, with the support of the Kofi Annan Foundation.
The primary objective of the Kofi Annan Road Safety Award is to motivate key stakeholders – governments, private sector, and civil society organisations – to develop and implement innovative and outstanding initiatives to save lives on Africa's roads.
When it comes to road accidents, Africa pays the heaviest price with the world's highest fatality rate of  26.6 road deaths per 100,000 population compared to the world average of 17.5 per 100,000 and 9.3 per 100,000 in Europe (WHO).
A child in Africa is twice as likely to die on the road than a child in any other part of the world. It is, therefore, crucial to redouble efforts on the African continent. The UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Road Safety, Mr. Jean Todt, proclaims that "Increasing effective actions to stop the carnage on African roads is imperative if we are to achieve the new Decade of Action for Road Safety, aiming to halve the road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030. It is arguably the most affected region on the planet."
Ghana is among the countries that report a high prevalence of road traffic deaths, with 24.9 per 100,000 inhabitants (WHO 2016). Nearly 2,000 lives are lost in the country each year due to crashes - and pedestrians are particularly at risk. Read More.

Title: Up to two-thirds of the population in Ghana experienced a decrease in household income due to COVID-19
Content: 12 March 2022
A new UNICEF-World Bank report finds that lost earnings due to the COVID-19 pandemic have left 1 in 4 households with children going a day or more without food.
The report titled Impact of COVID-19 on the welfare of households with children presents findings from data collected in 35 countries, including Ghana. It found that households with three or more children were most likely to have lost income, with more than three-quarters experiencing a reduction in earnings. This compares to 68 percent of households with one or two children.
Findings from Ghana show that about 22 million people, making up about two-thirds of the population, experienced a decrease in household income because of the pandemic.
In a joint press release issued by the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, and World Bank, the UNICEF Director of Programme Group, Sanjay Wijesekera says “the modest progress made in reducing child poverty in recent years risks being reversed in all parts of the world. Families have experienced income loss at a staggering scale. While last year inflation reached its highest level in years, more than two thirds of households with children brought in less money. Families cannot afford food or essential health care services. They cannot afford housing. It is a dire picture, and the poorest households are being pushed even deeper in poverty,” .
The report finds that children in 40 percent of households did not engage in any form of educational activities while their schools were closed. In Ghana, 35 percent of children in Basic School and 28 percent of Senior High School students were not engaged in learning while they were at home from March to December 2020. The main challenge faced by children for home learning was access to basic tools such as computers or phones and internet. Given that data is compiled at the household level, the actual participation rate at individual level is likely even lower, especially for children who come from households with three or more children.

Title: Africa beyond aid: mobilising the youth around innovative ideas, to reimagine a prosperous continent
Content: 21 October 2021
The 2021 YouthConnekt Africa Summit 2021, the fourth summit to be held, has opened in Accra, Ghana.  The summit connects African youth from across the continent and beyond with policy makers and influencers, political and industry leaders in public, private and development sector by creating a platform to engage, design, and accelerate youth-led initiatives at the continental level.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, H.E Mahamudu Bawumia, Vice President of the Republic of Ghana, noted that Africa is one of the most youthful continents globally, with a population that can shape the continent's development trajectory. “Ensuring that young people assume their rightful role in Africa’s growth will require investment in the digital skills so they can respond to the evolving needs of the continent. However, we must do our intervention to harness the value of the youth aligned to human rights and gender equality. That is why our education policy must be gender sensitive. When we create a future where every youth can reach their fullest potential, only then can we say we are creating a brighter future for the continent”.
A press release issued by the organisers notes that the 2021 Summit is taking place under the auspices of the Government of Ghana, through the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the National Youth Authority (NYA), in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda. The three-day summit promises an offer of several enriching and highly interactive sessions, ranging from high-level plenary discussions, a masterclass on advocacy and active citizenship, a made-in-Africa marketplace, a youth development stakeholders roundtable, among others.
The Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa (UNDP), Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa, noted that the theme for this year’s summit is important, timely and empowering. “We truly believe in the transformative potential of the AfCFTA – and Africa's Money working for Africa's Development. UNDP will work steadfastly to translate the ambition and promise of the AfCFTA into opportunities for young people and strengthen preparedness by mobilising to produce Made in Africa," she added.

Title: Ghana: Anti-LGBTI draft bill a “recipe for violence” – UN experts
Content: 12 August 2021
GENEVA – UN human rights experts* urged Ghana’s Government to reject a proposed ‘family values’ bill, saying it seeks to establish a system of State-sponsored discrimination and violence against the LGBTI community. The first reading of the bill took place on 2 August 2021, and its consideration is expected to resume in October 2021.
“The draft legislation argues that any person who deviates from an arbitrary standard of sexual orientation or gender identity is immediately to be considered dangerous, sick or anti-social,” said the experts. “Such laws are a textbook example of discrimination.
“The proposed law promotes deeply harmful practices that amount to ill-treatment and are conducive to torture, such as so-called ‘conversion therapy’ and other heinous violations like unecessary medical procedures on intersex children, and so-called corrective rape for women,” they added.
The independent experts, appointed by the Human Rights Council, presented an analysis of the draft bill to the Ghanaian Government, concluding that adopting the legislation in its current or any partial form would be tantamount to a violation of a number of human rights standards, including the absolute prohibition of torture.

Title: Businesses may need more time and support to recover from COVID-19, as 16000 estimated agribusinesses remain closed in Ghana - new survey reveals.
Content: 07 June 2021
COVID-19 has affected almost all sectors of the economy and agribusinesses, which form an important part of the economy, have not been left out. New data on the impact of the pandemic on agribusinesses in Ghana suggest it may take a little more time and support for businesses to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The data reveal an estimated 16,000 agribusiness firms remain closed, with over 78,000 estimated staff laid-off and more than 267,000 workers having their wages reduced between May 2020 and January 2021.
The survey results released by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS),  funded by the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), collected data from about 8,000 agribusinesses across Ghana. The findings reveal an increase in the estimated number of job losses for agribusiness workers, from 51,111 during the lockdown to 78,412 in the post-lockdown period. In the same vein, workers with reduced wages increased from 175,255 during the lockdown period to 267,211 within May 2020 and January 2021.
“The Agribusiness Tracker builds on the COVID-19 Business Tracker and this is to enable us compare the data over time. This way, we are better positioned to inform Government and key stakeholders on the changes over time. We believe this panel data will guide the implementation of the Government’s Ghȼ100 billion COVID-19 Alleviation and Revitalization of Enterprise Support (Ghana CARES) Programme, seeking to enable the economy to recover”, noted Prof. Samuel Kobina Annim, Government Statistician.
The data also show slow demand for goods and services for most agribusinesses, with over 77,000 firms (61.5) reporting a decline in sales within the post-lockdown period under review. This implies that, though there is some improvement after the lock-down restriction (from 84,869 to 77,254 agribusiness firms reporting sales decline), agribusinesses are yet to recover to the level seen prior to the coronavirus pandemic. For example, sales growth was 30.2% prior to the pandemic, 10.7% during the lockdown and 15.4% after the lifting of the restriction.
Similarly, despite some improvement in inputs supply post-lockdown, about half of agribusiness firms (45.9%) still have challenges in getting supply inputs. The regional distribution shows that the Greater Accra region is the most impacted, with almost three out of ten firms (28%) reporting input supply challenges. Even though the drift in policy is relatively slow, as much as 8% of firms have started sourcing from domestic sources.
“Data is very critical in helping Ghana recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This Agribusiness Tracker results will therefore help businesses in the recovery process, as the data will not only inform policy on building back better, but doing so inclusively”, noted Charles Abani, UN Resident Coordinator for Ghana.
However, there are some positive trends, as digital technology is beginning to play a significant role in the operations of firms, with almost 9 out of 10 firms leveraging digital platforms including social media to market their products. Similarly, mobile money and door-to-door delivery via courier services, and internet usage for business operations also increased, with about 8 in 10 firms (77%) increasing the use of the internet in marketing compared to 19% percent during the lockdown period.
It is heartwarming to know that using digital technologies to transform data into action is at the heart of Ghana’s COVID-19 response and recovery. It will be important to consolidate this gain through the effective implementation of the National Data Roadmap process to ensure equity and the protection of more businesses”, emphasized Dr. Angela Lusigi, Resident Representative of UNDP in Ghana.
Also, though increase in access to finance is yet to get to pre-pandemic level (22.5%), this has marginally increased from about 12% during the lock-down to 14% post-lockdown. Despite the slight increase, three in ten agribusinesses reported decrease in accessing finances mainly due to high interest rate.
The COVID-19 Agribusiness Tracker survey also enquired about the level of awareness among the firms on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, which is expected to provide a single market for goods and services in Africa. The findings suggest a low awareness level, with only one in four agribusiness firms knowing about the AfCFTA. The top three support the firms need to participate in AfCFTA include increased information on business opportunities, reduced cost of credit, and removal of policy or regulatory bottlenecks.
“Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of the economy. Agribusinesses especially, have great potential in Ghana with hard-working entrepreneurs needing support to un-lock their opportunities”, noted Regina Bauerochse Barbosa, Country Director GIZ Ghana.

Title: Two Ghanaian peacekeepers to be honoured Posthumously during the 2021 International Day of UN Peacekeepers’ ceremony at UN Headquarters
Content: 25 May 2021
The two Ghanaian fallen peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously are WO1 Patrick Ackah who served with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL); and Mr. Emmanuel Mac Kwasi Dorbi who served in a civilian capacity with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).
UN Headquarters will observe the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers on Thursday, 27 May 2021. Secretary-General António Guterres will lay a wreath to honour the more than 4,000 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948 and will preside over a ceremony at which the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal will be awarded posthumously to 129 military, police and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their life serving under the UN flag last year and in the first month of this year.
Among the fallen peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously are two from Ghana: WO1 Patrick Ackah who served with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL); and Mr. Emmanuel Mac Kwasi Dorbi who served in a civilian capacity with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).
The two Ghanaians will be honoured at a ceremony to be presided over by the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres in New York on 27 May 2021 as part of events marking the 2021 International Day of UN Peacekeepers.
Ghana is the 10th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys nearly 2,300 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Mali, the Middle East, Somalia, South Sudan and the Western Sahara.
During the ceremony, the Secretary-General will also award the ‘2020 Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award’ to Major Steplyne Buyaki Nyaboga a Kenyan military officer who served with the African Union – United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, (UNAMID). Created in 2016, the Award “recognises the dedication and effort of an individual peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.”
In Ghana, a virtual youth engagement will be held in commemoration of the Day.  Tributes will be paid to Ghanaian peacekeepers serving to ensure the maintenance and sustenance of peace and those who have lost their lives in the cause.  Participants at the virtual event will interact with two young Ghanaian peacekeepers serving with the UNIFIL.  They will share their experiences with the goal of inspiring young people to champion the cause for peace and security. To participate in this event, please register here: http://bit.ly/UNinGhana
In a message to mark the Day, the Secretary-General said of the fallen peacekeepers: “Their service and sacrifices will never be forgotten.”  He further said: “I express my deep gratitude to the 85,000 civilian, police and military personnel currently deployed in some of the world’s most challenging hotspots to protect the vulnerable and help to build peace. Despite the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, as well as the risk of infection, these men and women have pursued their mission while also supporting local authorities in the fight against COVID-19. I offer sincere condolences to the families of peacekeepers who have fallen victim to this terrible disease.”
The theme for this year’s observance is “The road to a lasting peace: Leveraging the power of youth for peace and security.” Tens of thousands of young peacekeepers deployed around the world play a key role in helping UN missions implement their mandated activities, with the active participation of young people from host communities.  Across our missions, peacekeepers collaborate with youth to reduce violence and sustain peace, including through DDR and Community violence reduction programmes.
Jean-Pierre Lacroix, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, said: “We salute the dedication and bravery of our peacekeepers, who serve and perform admirably in challenging environments only compounded by the ongoing pandemic. I also honor our young peacekeepers who bring energy and innovation, and serve as role models to youth populations working tirelessly to ensure meaningful representation and participation in political processes.”
He added: “Our peacekeepers deserve our full support, and we must continue to work together to do all we can to improve their safety and security and give them the tools to succeed.”
The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers was established by the General Assembly in 2002, to pay tribute to all men and women serving in peacekeeping, and to honour the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of peace. The General Assembly designated 29 May as the International Day of UN Peacekeepers in commemoration of the day in 1948 when the UN’s first peacekeeping mission, the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), began operations in Palestine.
Since then, more than 1 million women and men have served in 72 UN peacekeeping operations, directly impacting millions of people, and saving countless lives. Today, UN Peacekeeping deploys more than 89,000 military, police and civilian personnel in 12 operations.

Title: 350,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have arrived in Ghana
Content: 07 May 2021
Today, Ghana welcomed the arrival of 350,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility (CEPI, GAVI, UNICEF, WHO), with logistical support from UNICEF. These AstraZeneca vaccine doses, which were developed by the Serum Institute of India (SII), form part of the larger 1.7 million consignment of doses allotted earlier to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Over 1.3 million doses have been reallocated to five countries in Africa.
Ghana was selected as one of the recipients of the doses due to its rapid, efficient and coordinated response to this public health crisis, as well as its absorption capacity.  The Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Service have also significantly strengthened cold chain equipment and facilities over the past years, with support from GAVI and UNICEF. This has enabled the successful and safe transfer of the vaccines between the two West African countries. To assess the potency of the vaccine, UNICEF formed part of an independent committee which conducted a complete assessment of the vaccine and formally endorsed that they have been well maintained and are safe and effective for immediate use.
The initial vaccination campaign, which commenced on Monday 1st March following the vaccination of the President of the Republic, His Excellency Nana Akufo-Addo, has enabled health workers, persons with underlying comorbidities, frontline personnel living in Greater Accra, Ashanti and parts of Central regions to receive their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This has provided a level of protection for members of the population most at risk of contracting the virus.
UNICEF and WHO in Ghana welcome the arrival of these vaccines during these challenging times, when there is limited availability of the COVID-19 doses globally.  Thanks to the collaboration between Governments, the support from the COVAX facility (CEPI, GAVI, UNICEF, WHO) and all partners, we are all seeking to ensure that the population is protected.

Title: UNOPS supports Government of Ghana’s sustainable infrastructure investment event
Content: 14 April 2021
The SDG Investment Fair is part of the government’s programme to find alternative financing for the nation’s sustainable infrastructure projects
The government of Ghana participated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Investment Fair held between 13-14 April 2021. The United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) hosted its annual two-day SDG Investment Fair focusing on connecting governments and the private sector to accelerate the mobilization of resources for the SDGs.
This year’s event saw the Ghanaian delegation, led by the Honorable Minister of Finance, in partnership with the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC), and sector ministries, present a series of investment-ready project pipelines to potential investors to identify appropriate financing instruments, alongside governments of Kenya, Jamaica and Pakistan.
Funded by the Joint SDG Fund, UNOPS work in Ghana has focused on supporting the former Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Finance, GIPC, and National Development Planning Commission in the collection of data to package a series of SDG-related infrastructure projects for the Ghanaian delegation to present at the 2021 SDG Investment Fair hosted by UNDESA.
Beyond the fair, UNOPS aims to develop technical capacity in selected ministries in the use of its bespoke evidence-based tools including the National Infrastructure Systems MODel (NISMOD) tool and the Sustainable Infrastructure Financing Tool (SIFT). These tools, which are expected to complement existing National Tools, are key to assess priority infrastructure challenges and gaps, understand how countries are responding, consider a country’s unique positioning and develop parameters for further development and financing. UNOPS support to the government of Ghana will extend beyond the Fair and into the later part of 2021.
In his opening remarks, the Minister of Finance said: “The government of Ghana recognises that we must rebuild and promote the building blocks for an inclusive and sustainable society. Our focus remains to move urgently towards opportunities and solutions that achieve sustainable and broad-based economic growth, without harming our climate or leaving hundreds or millions of people in poverty.
It is our expectation that these projects would generate interest among investors and ultimately lead to the mobilisation of the much-needed resources to propel the achievement of the SDGs in Ghana and improvement in the quality of life of the people of Ghana.”
The Director of the Ghana Country Office, Ifeoma Esther Charles-Monwuba, added: “UNOPS lends its support to member states to de-risk and attract needed financing through evidence-based analysis of priority projects that would accelerate the attainment of the SDGs.
“We are excited to work with the Government of Ghana in their preparation towards the SDG fair and look forward to continued partnership with the government of Ghana and the private sector. ”
Attended by a number of participants, the SDG Fair brings together stakeholders from various circles including government, the private sector, academia, international and regional financial, trade and development institutions, including development banks, experts from think tanks, foundations, UN agencies and journalists to discuss the importance of private finance to implement the 2030 Agenda.

Title: UN launches new campaign, Only Together, to support global vaccine equity call
Content: 11 March 2021
The United Nations today launched a new global campaign, Only Together, to support its call for fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
The campaign stresses the need for coordinated global action to ensure vaccines are accessible in all countries, starting with health-care workers and the most vulnerable.
More than 2.5 million people around the world have died from COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 vaccines will stop people from dying, prevent new variants from emerging, reignite economies and offer the best hope to end the pandemic.
The biggest vaccine roll out in history is now underway with millions of doses being delivered around the world, including to some of the world’s poorest countries, through the efforts of COVAX, the global vaccine equity mechanism.
But these doses will initially only cover a small segment of the populations — healthcare workers and the most vulnerable. By the end of 2021, COVAX aims to offer vaccines to nearly 30 per cent of each participating country’s population. But that progress pales compared to 10 rich countries who possess nearly 80 per cent of all COVID-19 vaccines, with some planning to vaccinate their entire population within the next few months.
COVAX, which is led by the World Health Organization, GAVI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and in partnership with UNICEF, has 190 participating countries. It needs more than US$2 billion to fully meet its goal to vaccinate those most in need by the end of the year.
Pledging new funding for COVAX is critical, but more can be done to scale up vaccine access by sharing excess vaccines, transferring technology, offering voluntary licensing or even waiving intellectual property rights.
“If the world’s scientists were able to develop safe and effective vaccines in just seven months, the aims of world’s leaders must be equally record-breaking — to provide enough funding and to ramp up manufacturing to enable everyone on earth to be vaccinated,” said UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming.

The UN in Ghana and partners have launched a project to promote public health and strengthen the domestic supply chains of personal protective equipment and hygiene supplies in response to the COVID-19 situation in Ghana.
The project will be implemented by UNIDO in coordination with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
The Government of Ghana represented by the Minister for Health, Hon. Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, the Japanese Ambassador to the Republic of Ghana, Mr. Tsutomu Himeno, and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Representative in Ghana, Mr. Fakhruddin Azizi, have marked the launch of the project “Promoting public health and social resilience against COVID-19 by strengthening the domestic supply chain of personal protective equipment under a circular economy approach.” The project will be implemented by UNIDO in coordination with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Ghana to promote public health and strengthen the domestic supply chains of personal protective equipment and hygiene supplies in response to the COVID-19 situation in the country. This project is also in response to the sixth strategic objective of revised National Strategic COVID-19 Response Plan (2020 – 2024) of the Ministry of Health which seeks to “Increase Domestic Capacity & Self Reliance”.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to influence the socio-economic stability of Ghana. The ability to supply and deliver personal protective equipment, disinfectants, and hygiene products is critical for the country’s efforts to control the virus and its potential resurgence in the future.

As we celebrate this festive season with family, friends and loved ones, it is important to be mindful of the existence of the virus and protect ourselves by wearing face mask, regularly use hand sanitizers and frequently wash hands with soap under running water, as well as keep social distance during gatherings.

Title: UNHCR appoints Ghanaians Nikki Samonas and Kwame Annom as Goodwill Ambassadors
Content: 03 December 2020
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency has announced the appointment of Ghanaians Nikki Samonas and Kwame Annom as their newest Goodwill Ambassadors.
Nikki Samonas is a media personality and an actress, and Kwame Annom is a professional culinary chef. Their journey, supporting the plight of people forced to flee their homes, began in 2017 with UNHCR’s LuQuLuQu campaign. In their roles as LuQuLuQu High Level Influencers, they have used their voices to help change the narrative of refugees.
In 2017, Nikki visited Ampain refugee camp in Ghana to learn more about UNHCR’s emergency response work and meet with families forced to flee their homes. This first visit affirmed Nikki’s commitment with UNHCR. “Ever since my participation with the LuQuLuQu campaign and my visit to Ampain refugee camp where I met with resilient refugee families, I have sought to transform public perception of our forcibly displaced African brothers and sisters – to recognize their strength, courage and hope. I am overjoyed to continue my journey with UNHCR as a Goodwill Ambassador. I wish to use my new role to champion ways to improve the lives of the most vulnerable communities in Ghana,” said Nikki.
Kwame, commonly referred to as Biishville, has used his unique craft as a culinary chef to draw attention to the refugee cause. “I remember meeting with refugee families in 2017 and cooking with them in the camp. I was so inspired by these families – that despite the grave hardship they had undergone, they welcomed me into their shelters. It made me realize that I have a unique opportunity to use my profession as a chef to amplify the call for action to support families forced to flee. Now as a Goodwill Ambassador, I dedicate my role in uniting refugees, host communities and donors to increase support and awareness for the refugee cause and UNHCR’s work on the ground,” said Kwame.
Their appointment comes at a time when UNHCR’s Global Trends report states that over 79.5 million people worldwide are forcibly displaced. Ghana currently hosts 13,355 refugees from over thirty different countries including Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, Liberia, Sudan and Cameroon.
In response to Nikki and Kwame’s appointment, Esther Kiragu, UNHCR Representative in Ghana stated: “Nikki Samonas and Kwame Annom are Ghana’s first UNHCR Goodwill Ambassadors, and we are incredibly happy to welcome them both into their roles. Both Nikki and Kwame have demonstrated a deep commitment to the refugee cause, lending their voices, platforms, networks and personal support to drawing attention to the refugee situation in Ghana and the role that host community and private sector can play in alleviating the struggle and challenges of forced displacement.”
Kwame and Nikki most recently supported UNHCR’s Mask4Refugees campaign and previously participated in UNHCR LuQuLuQu’s Step for Safety walks, the UNHCR Greatest Gift Christmas campaign and concert.

Title: Green Climate Fund approves $54.5m project to reduce deforestation and carbon emissions in Ghana
Content: 20 August 2020
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) has approved a project worth 54.5 million US dollars to address the alarming deforestation and forest degradation challenges in the Northern Savannah Zone of Ghana, whilst promoting investments in the shea value chain and women’s empowerment. The ‘Ghana Shea Landscape Emission Reductions Project’, which was approved at the ongoing GCF’s 26th virtual  Board Meeting, will be implemented by the Forestry Commission (FC) of Ghana with technical support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with multiple national and local institutions, civil society organizations and private sector actors.
The project has leveraged vertical funds, with USD 30,100,000 grant from the GCF, about USD 15 million funding from the Government of Ghana and mobilized about  USD 9 million impact investments from the private sector in the shea value chain.
‘’I welcome this great milestone in Ghana’s Forestry Sector in the deployment of programmes and projects that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, build ecosystem resilience and also enhance the lives of communities that nurture the forests’’, stated the Chief Executive of the Forestry Commission, Mr. John M. Allotey.
Mr. Allotey highlighted how the implementation of the project would provide a strong contribution to Ghana’s achievement of its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the implementation of the Ghana National REDD+ Strategy. He also emphasized the FC’s appreciation to all the stakeholders involved in this victory, particularly the UNDP, and the Ministry of Finance which is the National Designated Authority (NDA) for the GCF.
The project’s interventions are expected to result in the restoration of 200,000 hectares of off-reserve savanna forests and 300,000 hectares of degraded shea parklands as well as the establishment of 25,500 hectares of forest plantations in severely degraded forest reserves. It is expected that the activities will result in an estimate of over 6 million tCO2e in emission reductions and removals over the first seven years of the project’s lifetime and 25.24 million tCO2e over 20 years.
“Shea landscapes are important sources of carbon storage and sequestration and these provide essential products and ecological services. GCF’s approval of this project is a welcoming news as this will help in restoring degraded landscapes and contribute to building a resilient economy that is capable of withstanding shocks without putting Ghana’s development agenda in jeopardy”, said  Ms. Roselyn Fosuah Adjei, Director of Climate Change and National REDD+ Focal Point, Forestry Commission of Ghana.
Ms. Adjei added that this impressive result could not be achieved without the support provided by the Italian Ministry of Environment, Land and Sea (IMELS) for the elaboration of the project proposal through the Global Italian initiative On REDD+ National Implementation (GIORNI).
Among other benefits, the ‘Ghana Shea Landscape Emission Reductions Project’ will also bring about a breakthrough in the shea sector by enhancing revenue generation for women and strengthen the livelihoods of over 500,000 people in Northern Ghana. The Global Shea Alliance (GSA), a non-profit industry association with 500 members from 35 countries, will be a key partner during the project implementation.
Simballa Sylla, the GSA President said: “this is a historic and defining moment for the shea industry in Ghana. The newly approved project will not only contribute to protecting rural communities from climate change consequences. It will ensure that livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Ghanaian families are improved, and that the shea industry is supported in its growth”.
“We are particularly happy with the approval from the GCF Board because of how critical this project is in reducing emissions, the expected value additions in the utilization of forest resources and contributions to livelihood improvement especially for women”, noted Silke Hollander, Deputy Resident Representative for UNDP in Ghana.
The project is aligned with the main climate change and forestry related policies, strategies and plans of Ghana, and this was highlighted by the President of Ghana, H.E Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo during the National REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Forum as having “the potential to transform the Northern Savanna ecosystem of Ghana with the right implementation and enforcement structures”.

Title: Maiden Multidimensional Poverty Index report for Ghana launched
Content: 29 July 2020
The UNDP in partnership with the Ghana Statistical Service, GIZ and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) of Oxford University, has launched Ghana's maiden Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Report. The findings show that the country has made significant progress on poverty reduction over time. However there are still significant deficits from the perspectives of health, education, with living standards reducing by nine percent, from 55 percent in 2011 to about 46 percent. This implies that with the current population of 31 million, 14 million Ghanaians are estimated to be multidimensionally poor.
A press release issued by the partners indicate that the national MPI was computed using data from the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) 2016/2017 and the 2011 and 2018 Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).
The MPI looks at poverty as a complex issue that transcends monetary deprivations and assesses the multiple pathways in which people experience poverty. Following the country’s ability to halve its money-metric poverty by 2015, the 2017 data show that, at least two out of every five Ghanaians are identified as poor beyond monetary deprivations.
The findings shed light on the different kinds of deprivations that affect citizens, using the three dimensions (health, education, and living standards), with twelve (12) corresponding indicators reflecting national priorities.
The report calls for distinctive policies in reducing the incidence of multidimensional poverty in Ghana. It proposes more focused Investments in health, with special attention to health insurance coverage in all the regions of the country. It further recommends coordinated efforts to increase school attainment and school attendance in the Upper West and Upper East Regions respectively, whiles policies on improving the nutritional outcomes of children should be more centered on the Greater Accra Region.  In addition, the MPI report calls for policies and programs to prioritize poverty reduction in regions with the highest incidence of multidimensional poverty (Northern, Upper West, and Upper East regions).

Title: Everyone Can Make a Difference, Every Action Counts - UNHCR and Ghana Refugee Board Press Release
Content: 27 July 2020
Not only have record numbers of people who fled their homes to find safety increased – but the entire world is grappling with the devastation of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This global health crisis is evolving into an economic crisis, and in turn, has exposed social inequalities in our societies which are begging for solutions.

In commemoration of World Refugee Day 2020, the Representative of UNHCR Ghana and the Executive Secretary of the Ghana Refugee Board have issued a press release calling for renewed commitment to stand behind the UN Global Compact on Refugees. This Compact recognizes that forced displacement is a development issue. That there is a need to support host governments by easing the pressure of hosting refugees, to support the base for self-reliance and livelihoods so that they can contribute effectively in the economies where they find themselves, and to support the search for durable solutions including peace and reconciliation in countries of origin.

Title: Stanbic Bank partners with UNOPS to deliver COVID-19 test kits worth $100,000 to Ghana Health Service
Content: 09 June 2020
UNOPS has delivered 5,568 units of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test kit, 5,504 units of Nucleic acid (RNA) extraction kit, and an Autopure 32A-Nucleic Acid Purification System to the Ghana Health Service (GHS). Funded by Stanbic Bank Ghana, the $ 101,541 project is aimed at strengthening the government of Ghana’s effort at tracing, testing, treating and combating the spread of COVID-19 cases in the country.
Stanbic Bank Ghana acquired these medical supplies using the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) procurement systems.
The global scale of the COVID-19 epidemic is having an unprecedented impact on the medical supply market and UNOPS is supporting partners across the globe to strategically reduce risk of the unstable market conditions and minimize the impact on procurement operations.
In a press release issued by UNOPS, the Chief Executive of Stanbic Bank, Alhassan Andani, expressed his outfit's pleasure to be contributing towards curbing the spread of the virus with these test kits. He said "knowing the status of our citizens makes it possible to treat those who are infected and that is the surest way to control the pandemic.".  He also called on individuals to play their part in the fight to stop the spread of Covid-19.
The Head of UNOPS, Ms. Ifeoma Charles-Monwuba, noted that the UN is "excited about our partnership with Stanbic and with the opportunity to deploy our Emergency Procurement Procedures (EPP) which enabled us to quickly procure the test kits in support of the Ghana COVID response," adding that the UN looks forward to continuing its partnership with the government of Ghana and the private sector to support the response as well as the recovery plan.
For his part, the Deputy Director General of the GHS, Dr Anthony Adofo Ofosu, noted that “Ghana Health Service is grateful to STANBIC Bank Ghana and UNOPS for supporting and improving the COVID-19 testing capacity of the Public Health Reference Laboratory in Korle-Bu.

Title: Street art for all during COVID-19: a call to stand together, and to stand with migrants
Content: 29 May 2020
Amidst the fight against the spread of COVID-19 in Ghana, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA), and the Delegation of the European Union to Ghana have joined forces with artists from the Ghana Graffiti collective, in an effort to use street art to sensitize people about COVID-19 prevention, safe migration and solidarity.
As the numbers of COVID-19 cases are rising in Ghana – we are counting 7,303 cases, 2,412 recoveries and 34 deaths – the Government, supported by the entire UN system, has put measures in place to curb the spread of the virus, that was first detected in the country on 12 March 2020. However, for many, including internal and international migrants living in crowded slums, access to clean running water or the possibility to maintain social distance, remain a luxury. IOM is therefore focusing its efforts to ensure that migrants and migration issues are fully included in the COVID-19 response.
The crisis is likely to negatively impact livelihoods and wellbeing of migrants and returnees, but also of people in vulnerable employment in the informal sector, as well as of households relying on remittances from abroad. In these circumstances, many, especially young people, may turn to migration in an attempt to cope. This may fuel irregular migration but also migrant exploitation and abuse including smuggling and human trafficking.
“The pandemic is going to exacerbate existing migration dynamics. Some people are going to lose their jobs and many may decide to move from rural areas to urban centers like Accra or from Ghana to the subregion or beyond, looking for greener pastures. So even in the midst of the immediate COVID-19 response, we need more than ever to actively continue our safe migration campaigns and to advocate for the response to leave no one behind including migrants,” said Sylvia Lopez-Ekra, IOM Ghana Chief of Mission.
To bring COVID-19 prevention and safe migration messages to the people, IOM is supporting a series of awareness raising activities throughout the country. For Accra, the capital city that sees the bulk of coronavirus infections in Ghana, street art was chosen, as it transcends cultures and creates bridges between people. Read more.

Title: WHO and UNICEF to partner on pandemic response through COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund
Content: 03 April 2020
The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF today announced an agreement to work together on COVID-19 response, through the historic COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund powered by the United Nations Foundation and Swiss Philanthropy Foundation.
The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund has been set up to facilitate an unprecedented global response by supporting the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. As part of the agreement, an initial portion of the money from the Fund – which currently stands at more than $127 million – will flow to UNICEF for its work with vulnerable children and communities all over the world.
“COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic requiring extraordinary global solidarity to urgently respond,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “I’m pleased that UNICEF joined the Solidarity Response Fund. With their extensive experience both in fundraising and in implementing programmes, this partnership will help us to work together closely to save lives.”
The money collected through the fund will be used, among others, to train and equip communities and health-care workers to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19. It will help countries expand their health-care capacity and mitigate its social impact, especially on women, children and vulnerable social groups. And it will accelerate research and development of treatments and preventive vaccines.
As a key partner in this joined-up effort, UNICEF will lead emergency efforts to ensure families and communities in the most vulnerable countries are fully engaged in the response and have access to water, sanitation and hygiene and other infection prevention and control measures. UNICEF will also ensure children, caretakers, and frontline responders such as social workers, teachers and healthcare workers are supported through evidence-based guidance through its vast community outreach and country programs.
“This is an extraordinary emergency that demands an extraordinary response, and we need all hands on deck—individuals, corporations, foundations, governments and other organizations around the world,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “UNICEF is pleased to join the Solidarity Response Fund. It will bolster our efforts to strengthen health and sanitation systems and help protect the most vulnerable families from knock-on impacts of COVID-19 on already overstretched health systems.”
Funds raised will be spent in alignment with the global response plan, and where needs are greatest

Title: World Bank Group Launches First Operations for COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Emergency Health Support, Strengthening Developing Country Responses
Content: 02 April 2020
The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors has approved a first set of emergency support operations for developing countries around the world, using a dedicated, fast-track facility for COVID-19 (coronavirus) response.
The first group of projects, amounting to $1.9 billion, will assist 25 countries, including Ghana, and new operations are moving forward in over 40 countries using the fast-track process. In addition, the World Bank is working worldwide to redeploy resources in existing World Bank financed projects worth up to $1.7 billion, including through restructuring, use of emergency components of existing projects (CERCs) and triggering of CAT DDOs and spanning every region.
In a press release issued on April 2, 2020, the World Bank Group says it is prepared to deploy up to $160 billion over the next 15 months to support COVID-19 measures that will help countries respond to immediate health consequences of the pandemic and bolster economic recovery. The broader economic program will aim to shorten the time to recovery, create conditions for growth, support small and medium enterprises, and help protect the poor and vulnerable. There will be a strong poverty focus in these operations, with an emphasis on policy-based financing, and protecting the poorest households and the environment.
“The World Bank Group is taking broad, fast action to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and we already have health response operations moving forward in over 65 countries,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. “We are working to strengthen developing nations’ ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and shorten the time to economic and social recovery. The poorest and most vulnerable countries will likely be hit the hardest, and our teams around the world remain focused on country-level and regional solutions to address the ongoing crisis.”
Responding to widespread supply chain disruptions, the World Bank is also helping countries access critically needed medical supplies by reaching out to suppliers on behalf of governments. The World Bank is also encouraging others to provide financial support to developing countries for the COVID-19 health response.
“This fast response package will save lives and help detect, prevent and respond to COVID-19 in the countries we serve,” said Axel van Trotsenburg, World Bank Managing Director of Operations. “Our country operations will be coordinated at a global level to ensure best practice is quickly shared, including approaches to strengthen national health systems and prepare for potential follow-on waves of this devastating virus.”

The Plan addresses the potentially devastating socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. In his report, Shared responsibility, global solidarity: Responding to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, the Secretary-General calls on everyone to act together to address the impacts and lessen the blow to people.
The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is attacking societies at their core, claiming lives and people’s livelihoods. The potential longer-term effects on the global economy and those of individual countries are dire.
In a new report, Shared responsibility, global solidarity: Responding to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, the United Nations Secretary-General calls on everyone to act together to address this impact and lessen the blow to people.
The report describes the speed and scale of the outbreak, the severity of cases, and the societal and economic disruption of COVID-19, which has so far claimed the lives of 33 257 people, with 697 244 confirmed cases in 204 countries, areas and territories1 .
“COVID-19 is the greatest test that we have faced together since the formation of the United Nations,” said António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations. “This human crisis demands coordinated, decisive, inclusive and innovative policy action from the world’s leading economies – and maximum financial and technical support for the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries.”
The report comes after the IMF has announced that the world has entered into a recession as bad or worse than in 2009. The report calls for a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10 percent of global GDP. The United Nations system—and its global network of regional, sub-regional and country offices working for peace, human rights, sustainable development and humanitarian action, will support all governments and partners through the response and recovery.

Title: A global approach is the only way to fight COVID-19, the UN says as it launches humanitarian response plan
Content: 25 March 2020
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres today launched a US $2 billion coordinated global humanitarian response plan to fight COVID-19 in some of the world’s most vulnerable countries in a bid to protect millions of people and stop the virus from circling back around the globe.
COVID-19 has killed more than 16,000 people worldwide and there are nearly 400,000 reported cases. It has a foothold across the globe and is now reaching countries that were already facing humanitarian crisis because of conflict, natural disasters and climate change.
The response plan will be implemented by UN agencies, with international NGOs and NGO consortia playing a direct role in the response. It will:
In his remark, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said:
“COVID-19 is menacing the whole of humanity – and so the whole of humanity must fight back. Individual country responses are not going to be enough.
“We must come to the aid of the ultra-vulnerable – millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves.  This is a matter of basic human solidarity. It is also crucial for combating the virus. This is the moment to step up for the vulnerable.”

Title: UN staff in Ghana work remotely to ensure continuity of our support to the country
Content: 13 March 2020
As many organizations and businesses worldwide, the UN has also taken measures to ensure it can continue its work to support countries towards peace, stability and prosperity for all the people we serve—and to continue addressing health-related or other types of emergencies. Such preparedness plan has also been set for UN team in Ghana, even before the first cases of COVID-19 was confirmed by the Government on 12 March.
One of the two cases of COVID-19 announced by the Government is a UN staff member who worked in one of the UN buildings up until the morning of 12 March 2020. To ensure the safety of all staff in that building and the continuation of our work for sustainable development, the United Nations in Ghana has decided, as a precautionary measure, that staff on those premises should work from home. This measure is taken temporarily, and decisions are taken in coordination with the national authorities. This supports containment of COVID-19 and is in line with United Nations worldwide standard Business Continuity Procedures. Other staff working in other UN entities’ premises continue working in the office normally. Read further.

According to the WHO, describing the situation as a pandemic does not change its assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It is a stark reminder for implementing needed actions to control the outbreak and change the course of its spread.
Meanwhile, the UN Secretary-General has called on every government to step up and scale up their efforts, adding that "since this is a crisis that affects everyone, we must all play our part."  In a statement, the UN Head said that the declaration of a pandemic is a call to action and that "as we fight the virus, we cannot let fear go viral."

Title: Ghana and Switzerland sign MoU to take action on climate commitments
Content: 02 March 2020
Ghana and Switzerland have signed an MoU to strengthen the mode of cooperation between the two countries under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on climate actions.

Both countries are responding to the need to implement enhanced climate actions, by moving ahead with an agenda to engage in ‘cooperative approaches’, to compliment Ghana’s Nationally Determined Contributions to address climate change
The bilateral agreement will facilitate Ghana’s National Clean Energy Access Programme (NCEP), which will enable the country to receive international financial support to implement projects to fulfill its climate commitments. NCEP’s overall goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by expanding energy access through distributed energy systems to residential houses and small and medium sized businesses. The actions being discussed under the agreement could see the installation of solar PV systems for commercial consumers, solar lanterns, solar home systems and provision of improved cooking systems nation-wide.
A press release issued by the UNDP indicates that the MoU is incredibly unique, and in fact only the second of such dialogues taking place globally, with Peru being the first country to have one. Through a close partnership with the Government of Ghana and institutional expertise on carbon market mechanisms, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was able to support and facilitate the dialogue between Ghana and Switzerland and will continue offering this support as the cooperation progresses.

Title: WHO Ghana Media Advisory Note on Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak -24 February 2020
Content: 24 February 2020

WHO has identified 13 top priority countries, including Ghana, which due to their direct links or high volume of travel to China or their poor scores in International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacities, need to increase their preparedness measures. So far the WHO has dispatched personal protective equipment for health workers, as well as thermometers and other essential supplies for screening and handling suspect cases at airports and other points of entry. Shipments have been dispatched to 12 countries.
Global shortages of essential equipment like face masks have presented problems.  While the top priority countries are WHO’s first areas of focus, the organization will support all countries in the region in preparing for novel coronavirus.
A release issued by the WHO Ghana office indicates that WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate regional work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission.   WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which is regularly updated to take into account the current situation.

Title: United Nations Launches Mission 1.5 Video Game to Curb Climate Change
Content: 17 February 2020
The United Nations has launched an internet and mobile based video game that seeks to collect the views of players on Climate Change policies in their countries and across the world.
The video game, Mission 1.5, is a campaign in which players take on the role of climate policymakers and make decisions to try to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Led by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the campaign aims to give 20 million people around the world the opportunity to have their say on ways to limit climate change that they want to see adopted by government leaders.
After the game, players are asked to vote on key climate actions they want to see adopted. This data will be analyzed and delivered to governments, who often lack access to reliable information on public opinion on climate action.
Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, said: "Together with partners from across the private and public sectors, we have the ability with this campaign to connect millions of people with their governments in an innovative two-way discussion on solutions to the climate crisis, and increase ambition ahead of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year.”
In Ghana, as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions UNDP is currently partnering with Government of Ghana under the National Clean Energy Access Programme (NCEP). The programme aims to operationalize collaborative approaches under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement.
UNDP is also working with Government to build the capacities of the private sector to develop low carbon bankable projects and increase private sector investment potentials for Ghana's Nationally Determined Contributions targets in the energy sector.
Gita Welch, acting UNDP Ghana Resident Representative said, “Mission 1.5 is a very significant addition to the climate fight, especially in this decade of action. It has the unique potential to empower citizens to complement the work that UN, the government of Ghana and other stakeholders are already doing to combat climate change “.
The Mission 1.5 game is available at https://mission1point5.org/  and can be played by people in every country in the world.

The WHO Director General on the advice of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee has declare the novel coronavirus (2029-nCoV) outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
WHO has identified 13 top priority countries (Algeria, Angola Cote d’Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia) which due to their direct links or high volume of travel to China need to increase their preparedness measures. The top priority countries are WHO’s first areas of focus, but the organization will support all countries in the region in their preparation efforts.
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect both animals and humans. Human coronaviruses can cause mild disease like a common cold, while others cause more severe disease (such as MERS - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and SARS – Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Some coronaviruses that are found in animals can infect humans – these are known as zoonotic diseases. Human coronaviruses are usually spread through droplets (coughing) and close personal unprotected contact with an infected person (touching, shaking hands).
On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, how it affects people may not be well known. One week later, on 7 January 2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus. The new virus is a coronavirus, which is a family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS. This new virus was temporarily named “2019-nCoV.”

Title: Empower Women in the fight for Anti- Corruption in Ghana ~ UNDP
Content: 04 December 2019
Women constitute half of the world’s population, yet they are mostly not engaged in discussions on corruption.  UNDP has called for the need to empower women in the fight against corruption.
Accra, 4th December 2019 - The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has urged all stakeholders to encourage women and contribute to their empowerment, so they can effectively support the fight against corruption in Ghana. The call was made by Nana Teiba Chinbuah, Head of Governance of UNDP, at Women in Anti-Corruption Forum organised by the Ghana Anti -Corruption Coalition (GACC) in partnership with UNDP, to discuss and identify mechanisms for strengthening women’s role in the fight against corruption.
Ms. Chinbuah emphasized that corruption impacts negatively on the development of a country, undermines good governance and the rule of law and erodes confidence and trust in the public sector. She noted that, progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would be undermined if corruption is not addressed.
“Women are the custodians of building the value systems of the next generation as they mostly take care of children. With the needed capacity and information, women can contribute to advocacy against corruption in their local communities and demand accountability from public officials”, she added.
Participants at the forum recognized that women constitute half of the world’s population, yet they are mostly not engaged in discussions on corruption, which is one of the most pressing issues of development and social justice. Research also indicates that women especially in developing countries are mostly more impacted by corrupt activities. For instance, UNDP’s Human Development Report (2012) revealed that about 76% of women in a survey responded that corruption has prevented them from having access to public goods and services. All these call for the need to include women in the fight against corruption.
In her presentation on the role of women in Anti- Corruption, a Legal Practitioner and Consultant, Ms. Clara Beeri Kasser–Tee indicated that, creating the right value systems, safe environment for women to freely talk, and giving women more access to opportunities are some of the ways to engage them in the anti-corruption advocacy.
“We need to implement more advocacy strategies on gender equality in public services, where women can effectively play their role as change agents to create systems that we don’t have and to nurture those systems until we have enough consensus within the population that abhors corruption”, Ms. Kasser urged.
The Women in Anti-Corruption forum is part of GACC ‘s new strategic plan (2020 to 2024) launched in September to enforce all anti-corruption laws in the country. The strategic plan focused on educating the public on the forms of corruption and its impact on society, building a vibrant, robust and self-sustaining coalition by 2024, sustaining advocacy for law enforcement and campaigning for the strengthening of anti-corruption laws.
The forum gathered about 65 participants from government, academia, development, civil society, private sector and students to dialogue on the links between gender and corruption.

Title: United Nations and Development Partners begin a 16-day Campaign to End Gender-based Violence in Ghana
Content: 27 November 2019
The UN in Ghana and partners are embarking on a campaign to increase advocacy on gender-based violence as part of the 16-day campaign against gender-based violence.
Accra, Ghana; 27 November 2019 – The first Lady, H.E. Mrs. Rebecca Akufo-Addo and the Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection, Hon. Cynthia Morrison are featuring in a 16-day social media campaign to increase awareness and intensify national advocacy to end gender-based violence. The campaign will run as part of the 16 days of global activism against gender-based violence and will feature personalities in the media, sports and public sectors, starting with the First Lady.
The campaign is organized by the United Nations, the High Commission of Canada, UK Department for International Development, the Australian High Commission, the European Union, and the French and German Embassies.
This year’s global theme of the 16 days of activism, Orange the World: Generation Equality Stands against Rape, calls upon people from all walks of life, across generations, to take a bold stand against rape. It is estimated that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lives. In some countries the figure is as high as 70 per cent.  Evidence shows that women who have experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence report higher rates of depression, having an abortion and acquiring HIV, compared to women who have not.
The theme also reminds us that the systemic silencing of victims/survivors and impunity for the perpetrators contributes to an entrenched and endemic violence against women and girls all over the world.
In Ghana, the theme Call it Out: Stop Sexual Violence against Women and Girls Now, reinforces the global call to foster a world free from violence for all women and girls.
Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive human rights violations occurring in the world. It happens in every country, including Ghana, in both public and private spaces. In Ghana, a significant number of women and girls continue to suffer violence and abuse, many of them in silence.  Statistics from the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) of the Ghana Police Service, show that between 2011 and 2016, 30,408 assault cases were reported nationally. In almost all cases, the victims were women. Many more cases of violence against women and girls go unreported.
“It is time we break the culture of silence and blame around gender-based violence” notes H.E. Mrs. Akufo-Addo. She further calls on Ghanaians and the world at large to “Get up, speak out”.
Join the campaign by re-tweeting using #orangetheworld and #16days.

Title: African Influencers and Business Champions to dialogue on unlocking the continent’s resources for Africa’s prosperity
Content: 04 November 2019
Ghana will host UNDP's Presidential Dialogue and Cluster Meeting from 7-13 November. The Presidential Dialogue is the first to be organised.
African leaders in politics, private sector, arts, media, academia and philanthropies will convene in Accra, Ghana, on 7 November 2019 at a high-level dialogue to explore how the continent can enhance and leverage the use of its own resources, creativity and innovation to effectively finance its development. The dialogue is being organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in collaboration with the Government of Ghana on the theme: “Africa’s Money for African Development: A Future beyond Aid”.
The event, to be hosted by the President of Ghana, H.E. Nana Akuffo-Addo, is part of series of high-level meetings to be held by the senior management team of UNDP in Africa, dubbed the UNDP Africa Cluster Meeting. Discussions will focus on the future of development in Africa and how to capitalize on the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), as well as opportunities emerging from the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Speaking ahead of the dialogue, at a recent meeting with a team from UNDP, Ms. Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, Minister of Foreign Affairs & Regional Integration of Ghana underscored the importance of Africa’s need for self-sufficiency, which is the core theme of the high-level dialogue. She highlighted the opportunities offered by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Africa Union’s agenda 2063 for the continent’s development.
“If we are able to work on all these goals and make progress or achieve them, I think what we will have is an Africa that is self-sufficient”, noted Ms. Botchwey.
Explaining the importance of the dialogue, the Assistant Secretary General and Regional Director for Africa of UNDP, Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa noted that, despite the huge funding gaps (an estimate of up to $1.2 trillion a year) required to implement the SDGs in Africa, the continent is losing about $50 billion annually to illicit capital outflows, mainly from trade mis-invoicing. These, she said, if resolved can address development challenges and debts across the continent. She indicated that the upcoming dialogue is intended to engage thought leaders in conversations to ensure that Africa’s money serves the needs of its people.
“The wealth hidden in the African continent is contained in the earth, the people and the creative energy that ignites innovations from dynamic ideas. This dialogue recognizes the power of African influencers across diverse sectors to accelerate development", Ms. Eziakonwa stated.
The high-level dialogue falls in line with UNDP’s strategic offer for Africa, to engage with African leaders and influencers, to drive sustainable development across the continent.
More than 200 participants are expected to attend the event. Leading African business leaders, environmentalists, climate change experts and youth, as well as renowned actors from the creative industry, trade and agribusiness including women will drive panel discussions at the dialogue.

Title: Urging stronger actions to make healthy diets accessible and affordable
Content: 16 October 2019
FAO celebrates World Food Day and highlights the role of all sectors to Zero Hunger
With the goal of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030, the FAO Regional Office for Africa and FAO Ghana Country Office are joining hands with different stakeholders to celebrate World Food Day with a series of events from 15 to 18 October 2019 in Accra, Ghana.
This year, FAO is calling for action across sectors to make healthy and sustainable diets accessible and affordable to everyone. Africa is still not on track in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger.
FAO’s flagship report ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018’ illustrates an uptick of the number of people suffering from hunger and malnutrition with 239 million people in sub-Saharan Africa or one in five people in the region.
“The heart of the development agenda ticks from the elimination of hunger and all forms of malnutrition. There are no chances of achieving the common vision of a safe, fair, peaceful and prosperous world when perennial hunger and not having access to nutritious foods mire millions of people in a punishing cycle,” said Abebe Haile-Gabriel, the FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa.
Dietary habits have moved from seasonal, mainly plant-based and fiber-rich dishes to diets that are high in refined starches, sugar, fats, salt, processed foods, meat and other animal-source products as a result of globalization, urbanization, and income growth. Such a changing trend has led to the rise of different forms of malnutrition, including obesity, running parallel to the challenges of hunger in the region.
An unhealthy diet is the leading risk factor of death across the globe for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain cancers. It also has a huge socio-economic cost.
Our Actions are Our Future
To spike up inspirations into actions, this year FAO is harnessing colorful and dynamic ways to spread the World Food Day spirit among key stakeholders, especially youth, the future forces for change towards Zero Hunger in Africa. This year’s celebration includes celebrities such as Kwame Eugene, DJ Switch, and Chef Addo to actively engage audiences and demonstrate healthy eating of nutritious indigenous foods. Over the next four days, events such as panel discussions on achieving Zero Hunger, live performances on the cycle of life - from Seed to Salad, cooking demonstration of the Tastes of the Sahel, and a healthy diet walk parade across Accra City are planned.
Abebe Haile-Gabriel urged all stakeholders to take action actions, “Governments to support investments in nutritious and healthy diets by putting in place the right policies and mechanisms in place; smallholder farmers to diversify production through adopting sustainable agricultural practices, the private food businesses to invest in foods that are more nutritious and adhere to nutrition-related laws and regulations. Most of all, we need people to be health conscious and make informed choices on what to consume.”
“This year we have put extra efforts in engaging children and youth to channel through the voices of the future generation. Children and women continue to suffer irreversible effects while nation and the world loses quality human resources for holistic growth due to unhealthy nourishment choices culminating into avoidable non-communicable diseases, highlighted Jocelyn Brown-Hall, FAO Representative to Ghana.
She added, “For us to reverse the undesirable trend, partnerships are fundamental. Farmers, Governments, researchers, the private sector and consumers, all have a role to play. FAO will continue its support to Ghana and other member countries in their efforts /to make sustainable healthy diets /a reality for all.”
World Food Day (WFD) and FAO
FAO celebrates WFD each year on 16 October to commemorate the founding of the Organization in 1945. Events are organized in up to 150 countries across the world, making it one of the most celebrated days of the United Nations (UN) calendar. These events promote worldwide awareness and action for those who suffer from hunger and for the need to achieve Zero Hunger, ensuring food security and nutritious diets for all.

Title: UNOPS Possibilities Forum launched in Ghana
Content: 26 July 2019
A two-day event in Accra has equipped traditionally disadvantage Ghanaian entrepreneurs with information that will help them increase client base, both within and outside Ghana.
Hosted by UNOPS Ghana in partnership with Ghana’s Office of the Minister of State in Charge of Public Procurement, the UNOPS Possibilities (UP) Forum is a capacity enhancement platform for local micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
It strengthens national capacity in Ghana by providing enterprises owned by traditionally disadvantaged groups – in particular, businesses owned by women, youth, people with disabilities – with the information and tools needed to help them succeed.
Ifeoma Charles-Monwuba, UNOPS Ghana Country Director and Representative to Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria said: “UNOPS is committed to supporting the government of Ghana in leaving no one behind, in line with its commitments to the SDGs and its own national policy. The UNOPS Possibilities Forum seeks to support enterprises to contribute meaningfully to the development of Ghana.”
Hon. Sarah Adwoa Safo, Minister of State in Charge of Public Procurement, said: “Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises play a crucial role in the development of Ghana and contributing to alleviating poverty. Ninety-two per cent of companies in Ghana are in this category and they contribute to Seventy per cent of Ghana’s GDP, so focusing on them is what we want to do”.
Hon. Carlos Kingsley Ahenkorah, Ghana's Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, said: “We hope that the UN and in particular UNOPS can assist our Ministry to strengthen a sustainability drive for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Ghana”.
In her keynote address, Hon. Akosua Frema Osei-Opare, Chief of Staff, Office of the President expressed her appreciation for the collaboration that led to the hosting of the event “I am grateful for the collaboration of Ministry of Procurement and UNOPS, and I hope that the UP Forum will support companies to learn about public procurement processes and opportunities, prepare themselves and be inspired by real life success stories.” Sylvia Lopez Ekra, Resident Coordinator of Ghana ad interim (IOM Representative), said: “Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises play a big role in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, as they create employment especially for those often left behind, such as women, youth and people with disabilities.”
Over the course of event, which started 24 July, participants have learned more about the government of Ghana’s mechanism that allocates 30 percent of public procurement spend to businesses owned by women, youth and people with disability. They also discussed how to register in the UN Global Market Place and how to do business with UNOPS. Local entrepreneurs also shared their success stories with participants, to inspire them going forward.

Title: Intensify Innovation by, and for Women and Girls to Ensure Gender Equality
Content: 08 March 2019
On International Women’s Day this year, the world is focusing on innovative ways in which we can propel gender equality and the empowerment of women.
Under the global theme “Think equal, build smart, innovate for change”, the United Nations in Ghana is calling for the intensification of efforts to put innovation by women and girls, and innovation for women and girls, at the heart of initiatives to achieve gender equality in the country.
In a press release issued by the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator for Ghana in observance of International Women’s Day, the UN Resident Coordinator, a.i. Ms. Sylvia Lopez-Ekra notes that “Innovation can help us address some of the barriers that women and girls face in accessing public services and opportunities. We should make it central to our efforts to promote women’s empowerment and in doing so, we need to make sure that women and girls are not only just consumers of innovation, but that they are given the space to be innovators themselves. The countless numbers of life-changing inventions created by women throughout history, prove that they are capable to do so, when society doesn’t get in their way”.
On International Women’s Day this year, the world is focusing on innovative ways in which we can propel gender equality and the empowerment of women.
Under the global theme “Think equal, build smart, innovate for change”, the United Nations in Ghana is calling for the intensification of efforts to put innovation by women and girls, and innovation for women and girls, at the heart of initiatives to achieve gender equality in the country.
Despite notable progress over the years, discriminatory social norms on gender continue to impact negatively on the lives of both women and men in Ghana. Women’s education and economic empowerment are too often compromised by lack of adequate and sustained opportunities, support, and investments. Child marriage and teenage pregnancy remain a critical barrier to girls’ continued education, skills development and full transition into employment. Ghanaian women constitute 70 % of the informal sector workforce and many are low income earners with limited social security protection. Data shows that women and girls spend significant time in care provision for children and the elderly, and in performance of chores such as cooking, cleaning or fetching water and firewood for the household. Shared responsibility could significantly lessen the burden and allow a fuller engagement in the community and public life and improve the access to education and economic empowerment opportunities.
International Women’s Day, observed globally on March 8th each year, seeks to bring to the fore women’s rights and gender equality. Widely recognized as both the preconditions and accelerators for achieving sustainable development, women’s rights and gender equality are an integral part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) which promote prosperity for everyone. SDG #5 is an important framework for holding decision-makers accountable to end gender-based discrimination, all forms of violence, exploitation and harmful practices on women and girls, improve the access to education, sexual and reproductive health information and services, and economic opportunity and participation in decision-making.
“Innovation can help us address some of the barriers that women and girls face in accessing public services and opportunities. We should make it central to our efforts to promote women’s empowerment and in doing so, we need to make sure that women and girls are not only just consumers of innovation, but that they are given the space to be innovators themselves. The countless numbers of life-changing inventions created by women throughout history, prove that they are capable to do so, when society doesn’t get in their way”, says the acting UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Sylvia Lopez-Ekra.
Let us encourage innovation and invest in technology to expand the access to opportunities and skills for women and men, facilitate the transition from education to employment, and close the gender gap. Women and girls must have opportunities to contribute to making real change, and help shape the policies, services and infrastructure that impact their lives.
Achieving a gender-equal world requires social innovations that work for both women and men and leave no one behind. From urban planning that focuses on community safety to e-learning platforms that take classrooms to women and girls, affordable and quality childcare centres, and technology shaped by women, innovation can take the race for gender equality to its finishing line by 2030.
On this International women’s Day, the United Nations in Ghana celebrates all Ghanaian women and remains committed to ensure equal opportunities and participation in the development process in the country.

Title: Let us work to change discriminatory laws to ensure the rights of all – UNAIDS Ghana
Content: 01 March 2019
Today 1st of March is Zero Discrimination Day. It is a day set aside by the United Nations to turn the spotlight on one of the biggest challenges in our societies today: Discrimination.
“On this day, we are obliged to ask ourselves not only about the meaning of discrimination, but also take a moment to reflect on whether we are fully aware of our actions – Are we discriminating in any way?” “Are we respecting the human rights of everyone?” Angela Trenton-Mbonde, UNAIDS Country Director remarks.
On Zero Discrimination Day, UNAIDS recalls the equal dignity and worth of every person, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is calling for action to change discriminatory laws and practices, which are a significant barrier for access to health and other services.
“Human rights violations are happening all over the world because of discriminatory laws and practices,” say Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS in a press release issued from its head office in Geneva, Switzerland. “Laws must protect, not cause harm. All countries must carefully examine their laws and policies in order to ensure equality and protection for all people, without exception.” He adds.
UNAIDS highlights the landmark decisions a number of countries have made to change discriminatory laws and bills. The Philippines lowered the age of consent for voluntary HIV testing without the need to obtain consent from a parent or guardian to 15 years and Malawi removed provisions from a draft bill that would have criminalized HIV non-disclosure, exposure and transmission.
Ghana has made progress in enacting laws to protect the rights of people living with HIV. For example, the Ghana AIDS Commission Act upholds the human rights of persons living with HIV as enshrined in the Constitution, and the right to redress in cases of violation. UNAIDS commends Ghana in this feat and encourages countries to examine discriminatory provisions in their laws and policies and make positive changes to ensure equality, inclusion and protection.
UNAIDS is therefore proposing specific actions that individuals, civil society organizations, parliamentarians and donor organizations can take to change discriminatory laws. These range from being an ally to someone affected by a discriminatory law to joining a nongovernmental organization, tabling amendments to laws and calling for reviews of legislation.
Working together to change discriminatory laws will restore dignity and respect and save lives.

Title: The United Nations Condemns the Killing of Ghanaian Journalist Ahmed Hussein-Suale
Content: 21 January 2019
The United Nations calls for a prompt, thorough and transparent investigation into Mr. Hussein-Suale’s death and full accountability for those responsible.Failure to bring perpetrators of human rights violations to justice, creates a climate of impunity, which perpetuates the cycle of violence against journalists.
The United Nations in Ghana reiterates the message of the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, on the occasion of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists: “When journalists are targeted, societies as a whole pay a price.  This should not become the new normal."
Protecting the fundamental right to freedom of expression also requires that journalists and media workers be protected, and action be taken to proactively promote their safety.
The United Nations in Ghana extends sincere condolences to Mr. Hussein-Suale’s family, friends and well wishers.

Title: 16 Heads of UN Agencies and Diplomatic Missions embark on Social Media Campaign to End Gender-Based Violence in Ghana
Content: 28 November 2018
Sixteen different messages, but one theme - End violence against women and girls.
Sixteen diplomats serving in Ghana are using social media platform to add their voices to the global campaign to end gender-based violence.  The campaign which began on November 25, will run for 16 days until December 10, 2018. The exercise is part of the United Nations 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence which takes place every year.
The diplomats include the UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Christine Evans-Klock, the Heads of Missions of Germany, Canada, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), France, Australia, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the European Union.
Others include the Heads of the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Mexico, the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the Netherlands, World Food Programme (WFP), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and Italy.
These officials are driving the campaign daily with key personal messages showing a strong and united front against Gender-Based Violence in Ghana and around the world. “Through our tweets, we want to amplify the voices of survivors and activists and encourage our combined audience to engage more and act against Gender-Based Violence” says the Head of Mission of IOM and UN Gender Champion, Ms. Sylvia Lopez-Ekra, who is leading this joint effort.
The campaign is a great opportunity to call for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls. For far too long, systemic silencing of victims/survivors and impunity for the perpetrators led to an entrenched endemic of violence. In recent years however, the drive for change had garnered strength as more and more women have come forward by using social media and other platforms to tell their story and call for change.
The theme for the 2018 #16Days campaign is Orange the World: #HearMeToo
