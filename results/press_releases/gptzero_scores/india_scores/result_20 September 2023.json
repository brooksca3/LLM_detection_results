  "text": "Remarks by Dennis Francis, President of the 78th session of the UNGA I thank you once again for your active participation in the 2023 SDG Summit. Our discussions over the last two days have sharpened our understanding of the challenges, as well as the available opportunities to ignite our renewed commitment to achieving the SDGs. As I reflect on the discussions over the past days, one thing is clear: We need to ACT. We need ambition. We need collaboration. We need to be timely. In terms of ambition, I welcome new commitments that have been announced, as well as dynamic new modalities for cooperation. It is recognized that we must use the latest in data, science, and technology to create innovative solutions, and these tools must be available to all. But ambition alone is not enough. It must be backed and butressed by action. We need to mobilize the necessary financial resources, ensuring that they are accessible, timely, and on reasonable terms, especially for countries that are already in debt distress and those experiencing multidimensional vulnerabilities. In that respect, we need to ensure that the international financial system serves all countries, responding to today\u2019s needs and flexible enough to respond to tomorrow\u2019s challenges. And we must ensure that our public institutions are supporting effective policies and accelerating progress toward the SDGs. In terms of collaboration, participants echoed \u2013 over and over \u2013 that individual ambition on its own will only get us so far. We need all stakeholders to actively contribute to achieving the SDGs, including the active involvement of affected local communities. I welcome and feel encouraged by the signals of new and stronger partnerships, which are critical to our success. In the corporate and business sector, they say time is money \u2013 and I am sure that there",
