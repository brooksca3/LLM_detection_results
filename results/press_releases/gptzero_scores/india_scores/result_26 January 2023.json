Since its launch in 2018, this Compact has grown to 45 member and observer entities and has also started meaningful engagement with civil society and private sector partners. Your work is more important than ever. Terrorism remains a global scourge -- an affront to humanity on every level. It affects people of all ages, cultures, religions and nationalities. For women and girls in particular, terrorism is often marked by sexual and gender-based violence. For communities, terrorism makes it more difficult to break the chains of poverty, or create stable political and economic systems, or build resilience against climate disasters. For people already facing grinding poverty, hunger and famine, terrorism makes life exponentially worse -- as we see in the Sahel and elsewhere. More broadly, terrorism takes a sledgehammer to our shared values, institutions and norms and standards. Human rights. The rule of law. Equal and sustainable development. And the peace and security that every country and region of the world deserves. Terrorism finds its home in vacuums. A vacuum of security. A vacuum of effective political and civic institutions. A vacuum of opportunity and hope. A vacuum of respect for human rights, equality and dignity -- especially for minorities and women and girls. And a vacuum of guardrails for technology, where terror can spread at the touch of a button. That\u2019s why the proposed New Agenda for Peace must focus on a holistic and comprehensive approach to building more peaceful and stable societies in which terror has no home.
