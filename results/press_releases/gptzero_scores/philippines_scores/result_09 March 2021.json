From high job losses to exploding burdens of unpaid care, from disrupted schooling to an escalating crisis of domestic violence and exploitation, women\u2019s lives have been upended and their rights eroded. Mothers \u2013 especially single mothers \u2013 have faced acute anxiety and adversity. But women have also been on the frontlines of pandemic response. They are the essential workers keeping people alive and holding economies, communities and families together. They are among the leaders who have kept prevalence rates lower, and countries on track for recovery. This year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day highlights the transformative power of women\u2019s equal participation. We are seeing it ourselves at the United Nations, where I am proud that we have achieved gender parity in UN leadership posts for the first time in history. When women lead in government, we see bigger investments in social protection and greater inroads against poverty. When women are in parliament, countries adopt more stringent climate change policies. When women are at the peace table, agreements are more enduring. And with women now serving in equal numbers at the top leadership posts at the United Nations, we are seeing even more concerted action to secure peace, sustainable development and human rights. In a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture, gender equality is essentially a question of power.
