It is already pushing tens of millions of people into extreme poverty and exacerbating inequalities of all kinds. In the midst of this turmoil, digital technology is a critical lifeline, enabling billions of people to maintain connections with loved ones, buy daily necessities, preserve their livelihoods and receive government assistance. From mobile payments to crowdfunding, digital technology is already helping to meet development challenges. As we begin the Decade of Action to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, it can be a critical enabler, kick-starting the transformative changes we need to create stronger, more resilient and inclusive communities and societies on a healthy planet. That is the background to my decision in late 2018 to establish a high-level Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals. I asked the Task Force to explore the nexus of digital technology, finance and the SDGs, complementing the work of the High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation. I wanted to explore how digital innovation can put more of the $380 trillion in assets managed by the global financial system, and the many trillions channeled through governments, at the service of people and planet. The Task Force\u2019s report, People\u2019s Money: Harnessing Digitalization to Finance a Sustainable Future, sets out an ambitious but achievable set of recommendations that could make a major difference in achieving our collective global goals.
