The objective of establishing these centers is to enhance the capacity of farmers in the merged districts to promote the cultivation of alternative crops and eradicate illicit crops and other drug-related crimes. With funding from the U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the ATCs were established by the UNDP Pakistan Rule of Law Programme in partnership with the Sustainable Development Unit of the Planning and Development Department (P&DD), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in the districts of Bajaur, Khyber, Mohmand, and Torghar. These centers will facilitate the training of the local farmers on the cultivation of alternative crops in the merged districts, where the cultivation of poppy predominates. Alternatively, crop cultivation will create opportunities for income diversification, gradually diminishing the prevalence of any illicit activities associated with narcotics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The training at ATCs will include skill-building sessions on timely land preparation, planting, weeding, irrigation, harvesting, storage, and marketing. These training centers, especially through modern technologies, can improve how farmers in these areas receive, exchange, and utilize information. The farmers will also be connected with enterprises for long-term income and job opportunities. Ms Lori Antolinez, Director, U.S. Embassy Office of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Mr Muhammad Jawed Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Secretary of Agriculture Department, and Dr Samuel Rizk, UNDP Resident Representative joined the event to celebrate the successful completion of the $975K project.
