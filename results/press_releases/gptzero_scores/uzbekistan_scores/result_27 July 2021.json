The United Nations Join Programme Strengthening Social Protection in Uzbekistan conducted the sixth on line webinar addressing gender equality. This time members of the Uzbek parliament, government agencies and ILO\u2019s social partners got acquainted with the concept of gender-responsive budgeting, tools and international practices and discussed the ways of it can be applied into the budget and policy-making process in Uzbekistan. The webinar offered comprehensive insight of the concept of gender-responsive budgeting and international practices and tools based on collective experiences of UN Women, International Labour Organisation, UNICEF and UNDP. According to UN Women Gender-responsive budgeting (GRB) is an approach to systematically integrate gender equality objectives into government policy, planning, budgeting, monitoring, evaluation, and audit. It does not mean simply developing a separate budget for women. It is a comprehensive policy that also includes the collection and allocation of public resources to empower both women and men by considering diversity of their rights, needs, interests, educational, geographical, ethnic, income and dis/ability backgrounds throughout the lifecycle and minimising negative aspects of gender inequality. Currently, Uzbekistan is developing three major strategies until 2030 on social protection, employment, and poverty reduction. It is important to mainstream gender equality in these strategies to ensure that no one is left behind. It is gratifying to observe increased attention to existing gender problems in Uzbekistan that has translated into two laws specifically targeting gender equality. These thoughts were shared in the welcoming speech of Ms Gulnora Marufova, First Deputy Minister of Makhalla and Family Support and the member of Gender Commission under the Senate of Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan.
