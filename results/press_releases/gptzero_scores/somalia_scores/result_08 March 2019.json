The Convention was led by the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development, in partnership with Federal and Federal Member State governments and with civil society organisations. The Women\u2019s Charter issued at the Convention calls for full inclusion of women across the political, economic and social spectrum in Somalia. It comes as the Constitution of Somalia is undergoing a review process and as key electoral and political laws are being developed. In particular the Charter calls for at fifty per cent quota across all three levels of government, including in the security sector, and in public administration. It also calls for zero tolerance for gender based violence and for women\u2019s rights to be enshrined in the revised Constitution, and in the finalised electoral, security and political laws. Socio-economic rights in the form of women\u2019s equal access to land, and to economic opportunities and technologies, to ensure long term resilience and stability, is also a key call in the document. Inputs to the Charter were given over the three days of the Convention by 300 delegates from federal and federal member states governments, women and youth group representatives, disability organisations, private sector organisations and members of academia from across the federal member states. The event was attended by the First Lady of Somalia, Her Excellency Saynab Abdi Moalim, the Mayor of Mogadishu Abdirahman Osman, and the Prime Minister of Somalia, Hassan Ali Khaire, as well as federal and federal member state Ministers and Members of Parliament.
