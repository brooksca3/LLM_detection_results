Mogadishu, 11 July, 2020 \u2013 The unprecedented fight against gender-based violence and harmful practices; including Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and early marriage should be prioritized as part of the wider efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 among the Somali population. According to the recently published Somali Health and Demographic Survey (SHDS), annually, one in 10 ever-married women experience physical violence perpetrated by their spouse. Lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 and the resultant economic impacts are associated with increasing household tensions, which are likely to result to an upward surge in the cases of spousal violence. FGM is almost universally practised in Somalia, despite years of campaigns and the negative impact associated with the practice. According to SHDS, 99 percent of women have undergone FGM of which two out of three have weathered the extreme form of mutilation. Girls in Somalia, forced to stay at home due to COVID-19, are now undergoing FGM in their homes. COVID-19 could have a far-reaching impact on the effort to end FGM, with a potential 2 million FGM cases occurring over the next decade that could have otherwise been averted. FGM has lifelong consequences for girls, has no health benefits and harms girls and women in many ways. FGM promotes early marriage among girls, a practice that robs girls of life opportunities stopping them from reaching their full potential.
