Deqa Yasin, presented a Women\u2019s Charter for Somalia, that calls for fifty percent representation of women in government, and in socio-economic sectors in the country. The Charter also calls for greater protection of women\u2019s rights, and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation (FGM). The Charter was presented by Minister Yasin at a side event of the CSW led by the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development and co-chaired by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Canadian Government. Speaking during her presentation the Minister said the Women\u2019s Charter and its acceptance by the government of Somalia was a milestone for women and girls in her country. \u201cThe demands of the Women\u2019s Charter are ambitious, and rightly so. To ensure they become a reality, we must invest in a real way in the future of women and girls. By doing so we will create a bright future for a peaceful and resilient Somalia.\u201d The Women\u2019s Charter was developed during a three-day Women\u2019s Convention in Mogadishu on 4-6 March, which was attended by 350 female and male gender champions from across Somalia.
