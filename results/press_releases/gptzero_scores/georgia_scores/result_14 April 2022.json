From the start, the United Nations has been actively engaged in delivering humanitarian support to the people in Ukraine, the people who are paying the highest price, and to the host countries of the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. But less attention has been paid to the global impact of the war in all its dimensions in a world that was already witnessing increased poverty, hunger and social unrest. The war is supercharging a three-dimensional crisis \u2014 food, energy and finance \u2014 that is pummeling some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, countries and economies.
