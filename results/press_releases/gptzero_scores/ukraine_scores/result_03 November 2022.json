It has been said that one might not always appreciate something until it is at risk or gone altogether. Over the past few days, I believe the world has come to understand and appreciate the importance of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. For stemming the food crisis. For easing prices and pressures on people around the world. For reducing the risks of hunger, poverty and instability. I am pleased to announce that, today, the Initiative has hit a new milestone. As of today, ten million metric tonnes of grain and other foodstuffs have been shipped through the Black Sea corridor. It has taken just three months to reach this milestone. Despite all the obstacles we have seen, the beacon of hope in the Black Sea is still shining. The initiative is working. It is our collective responsibility to keep it working smoothly. I thank President [Recep Tayyip] Erdo\u011fan and the Government of T\u00fcrkiye for their crucial contribution for that to happen.
