This is the first time the three Commissioners are in the country during its second mandate from March 2023, whereas our investigators have already been here several times. First, we visited Uman in the Cherkasy region and then travelled to Kyiv. We have met several interlocutors, including the Minister of Culture and Information Policy, the Ministry of Defence, the Ombudsman for Human Rights, the Office of the Prosecutor General, and the Security Service of Ukraine. During the Commission\u2019s first mandate, we provided two written reports: to the General Assembly in October 2022 and to the Human Rights Council in March this year. Furthermore, last week we published an extensive Conference Room Paper. It is based on the March report and contains a detailed account of the basis for the findings of the Commission. The Conference Room Paper presents a select number of cases and describes patterns of a wide range of violations by the Russian armed forces. The violations include wilful killings, unlawful confinement, torture, rape and other sexual violence, unlawful transfers and deportations of protected persons and children. Many of these violations qualify as war crimes, and some of them may, if confirmed by further evidence, amount to crimes against humanity, such as the use of torture and attacks on the civilian infrastructure.
