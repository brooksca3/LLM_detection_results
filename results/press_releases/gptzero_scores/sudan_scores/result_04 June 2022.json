Good morning to you all and thank you for coming. First, I would like to say that I was shocked by the killing of a young man yesterday during the protests to mark the violent dispersal by security forces of the 3 June pro-democracy sit-in in Khartoum in 2019. I \u2013 and many others \u2013 had called for restraint yesterday. However, it seems that this call was not heeded and, according to our information, live ammunition was used to disperse protestors. There can be no justification for firing live ammunition at unarmed protestors. This young man reportedly died after he was shot in the chest. This is a tragedy - each of these deaths is a tragedy for Sudan - another young man whose family are in mourning today. His killing must be investigated immediately, and the perpetrator prosecuted. I will be following up on this and other cases of human rights violations in my ongoing engagement with the authorities. Today marks the conclusion of my second visit to Khartoum in my capacity as United Nations Expert on Human Rights in Sudan. I would like to express my appreciation to the authorities for their cooperation and for facilitating my visit.
