To provide a comprehensive solution to land degradation in Armenia, FAO and the Ministry of Environment developed a joint project proposal, with potential funding from the Global Environmental Fund (GEF), that was presented and reviewed during the event.

Land degradation and desertification in Armenia are driven by both natural and anthropogenic (man-made) factors.
