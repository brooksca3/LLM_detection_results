Myanmar has this week marked a bleak milestone with more than 3 million civilians now displaced nationwide amid intensifying conflict.

Myanmar stands at the precipice in 2024 with a deepening humanitarian crisis that has spiraled since the military takeover in February 2021 and the consequent conflicts in many parts of the country, driving record numbers of people to abandon their homes seeking safety. Of the 3 million people who are currently internally displaced, more than 2.7 million people fled as a result of conflict and insecurity since the takeover. It is estimated that one third of those now displaced are children whose education and futures have been upended by conflict. Escalating flighting in many parts of the country, intensified since October 2023, has contributed to this rapid growth in displacement. Sadly, civilians not involved in the conflict pay the highest price across the country with many seeing no other option but to flee seeking safety. The 3 million displaced people are struggling to survive amid a widespread humanitarian crisis that has left a total of 18.6 million people in need. This is a million more than the previous year. Those in need include 6 million children.
