It is a time for reflection on the meaning of suffering, sacrifice, death \u2014 and rebirth. But this year, Holy Week is being observed under the cloud of a war that represents the total negation of the Easter message. Instead of celebration of a new life, this Easter coincides with a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. The intense concentration of forces and firepower makes this battle inevitably more violent, bloody and destructive. The onslaught and terrible toll on civilians we have seen so far could pale in comparison to the horror that lies ahead. Many good-faith efforts by many parties to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine have failed. Today I am calling for a 4-day Holy Week humanitarian pause beginning on Holy Thursday and running through Easter Sunday, April 24th, to allow for the opening of a series of humanitarian corridors. The humanitarian pause would provide the necessary conditions to meet two crucial imperatives.
