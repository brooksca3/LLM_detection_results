It's crucial to recognize that the call for voting third party isn't solely symbolic but a strategic push for a more diverse political landscape over time.  The argument asserts that voting for anyone other than Biden increases Trump's chance of victory. However, this perspective assumes a binary outcome, overlooking the potential long-term impact of promoting alternative voices. A shift toward a multi-party system is a gradual process, and fostering this change requires voters to make choices aligned with their principles.  Moreover, characterizing the choice between a "bland moderate Democrat" and an "extremely corrupt, authoritarian Republican" as high stakes underscores the need for broader political options. Supporting third parties now can pave the way for a more representative democracy in the future, where voters aren't limited to perceived lesser evils.  While the current election might seem high-stakes, it's crucial to consider the long-term goal of breaking the duopoly for a healthier democracy. Third-party votes, rather than being mere protests, can be strategic steps toward that transformative change.

It argues that addressing climate change can have multiple benefits, including reducing the risk of diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. The authors suggest that by investing in renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, not only can the impacts of climate change be mitigated, but also public health can be improved. The article concludes that there is a need for coordinated global action on both climate change and health, as they are closely intertwined and addressing one issue can have a positive impact on the other.

Some of the best options include:      Solar hot water systems: These systems use solar panels to heat water, reducing or eliminating the need for electricity or gas. They are most effective in areas with plenty of sunshine and can provide significant energy savings over time.      Heat pump water heaters: These systems use electricity to move heat from the air or ground to heat water. They can be more energy-efficient than traditional electric water heaters, especially in areas with mild to moderate climates.      Tankless water heaters: These systems heat water on demand, rather than storing hot water in a tank. They can be more energy-efficient than tank-style water heaters, as they do not have to continuously heat and reheat water.      High-efficiency gas water heaters: These systems use gas to heat water, but are designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional gas water heaters. They can be a good option for homes that do not have access to solar or electric hot water systems.      When selecting a climate-conscious hot water system, it is important to consider your specific climate, usage patterns, and budget. You may want to consult with a professional plumber or contractor to determine the best option for your home. Additionally, many utility companies offer rebates or incentives for energy-efficient hot water systems, which can help offset the upfront cost of installation.

The actions taken by former President Trump and his legal team after the 2020 election were within the legal rights afforded to any candidate in a democratic system.   By utilizing the judicial system to address election integrity concerns, they were ensuring that all votes were legal and accurately counted, not subverting democracy. It's important to note that questioning election outcomes is not exclusive to any one political party.   For instance, on January 6, 2017, several Democratic members of Congress, including Representatives Pramila Jayapal, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, Jamie Raskin and Maxine Waters formally objected to the electoral results, citing concerns over alleged foreign interference and voting irregularities. These instances demonstrate that questioning election results is a common practice in American politics, used by both parties to ensure electoral credibility and fairness.

Termites are commonly thought of as pests, but they actually play an important role in many ecosystems and have beneficial effects on the environment. Here are a few examples:   1. Soil Enrichment: Termites help to break down plant material in the soil, which enriches the soil and makes it more fertile.  2. Nutrient Cycling: Termites recycle nutrients in the soil, helping to ensure that nutrients are available to plants.  3. Habitat Creation: Termites build intricate underground tunnels and chambers, which provide shelter and habitat for other animals.  4. Carbon Sequestration: The wood that termites consume and break down would release its carbon into the atmosphere if it decomposed naturally, but the termites' activity instead sequesters carbon in the soil.

This massive increase in wind power is roughly equivalent to the output of 50 nuclear reactors, an impressive number given that there are only around 450 nuclear reactors in the world.  This calculation takes into account the variable nature of wind power. The latest figures however reveal that [onshore wind farms now operate with a capacity factor between 30-48%](https://windeurope.org/newsroom/press-releases/the-eu-built-a-record-17-gw-of-new-wind-energy-in-2023-wind-now-19-percent-of-electricity-production/#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20electricity%20produced,offshore%20wind%20is%20consistently%2050%25.), while offshore wind consistently achieves around 50%. This improved efficiency marks a significant step forward in the renewable sector's ability to provide sustainable energy.  Chinese turbine suppliers led the charge, installing 81.6GW of the total capacity, and dominating four of the top five positions in the global supplier rankings. Despite the competitive market dynamics, which have pushed Chinese manufacturers to seek opportunities abroad, 97% of their installations remained within China. Goldwind topped the supplier list, followed by Envision and Denmark's Vestas, which was noted for its geographical diversity with installations across 36 countries.  Ben Backwell, CEO of GWEC, highlighted the industry's rapid expansion but stressed the need for accelerated growth in emerging markets to meet global Net Zero ambitions. He called for enhanced government collaboration and supportive policymaking to maintain the momentum and address the climate crisis effectively.  This record-setting year underscores the vital role of wind energy in the global transition to renewable resources, even as it faces challenges such as supply chain constraints and the need for greater market support in various regions.

Hes achieved a great deal amidst constant criticism from every direction. He rose to the occasion when literal Nazis took to our streets and when a significant number of Americans made dumb decisions at the polls, electing the most idiotic and corrupt person in the history of our nation in response to our first Black President.    Coming out of retirement, he declared his readiness to serve once more, forging a coalition that has been pivotal in defending democracy. To those who value democratic principles, hes earned gratitude. Biden represents a pathway to a future where our democratic rights are preserved, free from the influence of those opposed to our freedoms. His greatness as a president stems not from being without fault but from his unwavering commitment to democratic ideals and his dedication to uplifting all Americans, especially from the ground up.  His tenure deserves our respect rather than derision. Known for his verbal slip-ups throughout his career, those mocking him today are merely seizing an excuse to belittle him. With democracy facing threats from within, particularly from Republican leaders who recognize their platforms lack of popular support, Biden and the Democratic Party stand as bulwarks against these challenges. It is crucial for the pro-democracy coalition to re-elect Biden and secure overwhelming majorities in Congress, initiating the vital work of repairing our democracy and safeguarding our collective future.

Year-round, isotope-constrained observations reveal strong seasonal variations in BC sources with a consistent and synchronous pattern at all Arctic sites. These sources were dominated by emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the winter and by biomass burning in the summer. The annual mean source of BC to the circum-Arctic was 39  10% from biomass burning. Comparison of transport-model predictions with the observations showed good agreement for BC concentrations, with larger discrepancies for (fossil/biomass burning) sources. The accuracy of simulated BC concentration, but not of origin, points to misallocations of emissions in the emission inventories. The consistency in seasonal source contributions of BC throughout the Arctic provides strong justification for targeted emission reductions to limit the impact of BC on climate warming in the Arctic and beyond.

Dyonisius et al. found that methane emissions from old, cold-region carbon reservoirs like permafrost and methane hydrates were minor during the last deglaciation (see the Perspective by Dean). They analyzed the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric methane trapped in bubbles in Antarctic ice and found that methane emissions from those old carbon sources during the warming interval were small. They argue that this finding suggests that methane emissions in response to future warming likely will not be as large as some have suggested.  **Abstract**  Permafrost and methane hydrates are large, climate-sensitive old carbon reservoirs that have the potential to emit large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as the Earth continues to warm. We present ice core isotopic measurements of methane (14C, 13C, and D) from the last deglaciation, which is a partial analog for modern warming. Our results show that methane emissions from old carbon reservoirs in response to deglacial warming were small (<19 teragrams of methane per year, 95% confidence interval) and argue against similar methane emissions in response to future warming. Our results also indicate that methane emissions from biomass burning in the pre-Industrial Holocene were 22 to 56 teragrams of methane per year (95% confidence interval), which is comparable to today.

This makes it possible to estimate the remaining carbon budget: the total amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide that can still be emitted into the atmosphere while holding the global average temperature increase to the limit set by the Paris Agreement. However, a wide range of estimates for the remaining carbon budget has been reported, reducing the effectiveness of the remaining carbon budget as a means of setting emission reduction targets that are consistent with the Paris Agreement. Here we present a framework that enables us to track estimates of the remaining carbon budget and to understand how these estimates can improve over time as scientific knowledge advances. We propose that application of this framework may help to reconcile differences between estimates of the remaining carbon budget and may provide a basis for reducing uncertainty in the range of future estimates.

Since then, it has become clear that the Montreal Protocol is an important mitigation treaty, affecting many aspects of the global climate. Here, we demonstrate that its effect reaches all the way into the Arctic. Specifically, we show that the implementation of the Montreal Protocol has postponed the occurrence of the first ice-free Arctic by as much as 15 y, depending on the details of future emissions.  **Abstract**  The rapid melting of Arctic sea ice is the largest and clearest signal of anthropogenic climate change. Current projections indicate that the first ice-free Arctic summer will likely occur by mid-century, owing to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. However, other powerful greenhouse gases have also contributed to Arctic sea ice loss, notably ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). In the late 1980s, ODSs became strictly regulated by the Montreal Protocol, and their atmospheric concentrations have been declining since the mid-1990s. Here, analyzing new climate model simulations, we demonstrate that the Montreal Protocol, designed to protect the ozone layer, is delaying the first appearance of an ice-free Arctic summer, by up to 15 y, depending on future emissions. We also show that this important climate mitigation stems entirely from the reduced greenhouse gas warming from the regulated ODSs, with the avoided stratospheric ozone losses playing no role. Finally, we estimate that each Gg of averted ODS emissions results in approximately 7 km^(2) of avoided Arctic sea ice loss.

Bastin et al. used direct measurements of forest cover to generate a model of forest restoration potential across the globe (see the Perspective by Chazdon and Brancalion). Their spatially explicit maps show how much additional tree cover could exist outside of existing forests and agricultural and urban land. Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25% increase in forested area, including more than 500 billion trees and more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity. Such a change has the potential to cut the atmospheric carbon pool by about 25%.  **Abstract**  The restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. We mapped the global potential tree coverage to show that 4.4 billion hectares of canopy cover could exist under the current climate. Excluding existing trees and agricultural and urban areas, we found that there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests. This highlights global tree restoration as our most effective climate change solution to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage. We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by ~223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.  ____  Related Material(s):  - [Can planting trees save our climate?](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2019/07/can-planting-trees-save-our-climate/)

Wang et al. explored the temporal dynamics of CFE on vegetation photosynthesis at the global scale. There has been a decline over recent decades in the contribution of CFE to vegetation photosynthesis, perhaps owing to the limiting effects of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This declining trend has not been adequately accounted for in carbon cycle models. CFE thus has limitations for long-term mitigation of climate change, and future warming might currently be underestimated.  **Abstract**  The enhanced vegetation productivity driven by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO) [i.e., the CO fertilization effect (CFE)] sustains an important negative feedback on climate warming, but the temporal dynamics of CFE remain unclear. Using multiple long-term satellite- and ground-based datasets, we showed that global CFE has declined across most terrestrial regions of the globe from 1982 to 2015, correlating well with changing nutrient concentrations and availability of soil water. Current carbon cycle models also demonstrate a declining CFE trend, albeit one substantially weaker than that from the global observations. This declining trend in the forcing of terrestrial carbon sinks by increasing amounts of atmospheric CO implies a weakening negative feedback on the climatic system and increased societal dependence on future strategies to mitigate climate warming.

Analyses of this countermovement have primarily focused on the role of conservative think tanks. Expanding this research, this article initiates an examination of the structure of key political coalitions that worked to oppose climate action. In conjunction with their allied trade associations, these coalitions have served as a central coordination mechanism in efforts opposed to mandatory limits on carbon emissions. These coalitions pool resources from a large number of corporations and execute sophisticated political and cultural campaigns designed to oppose efforts to address climate change. Through an analysis of twelve prominent CCCM coalitions from 1989 to 2015, I show that over 2,000 organizations were members of these coalitions and that a core of 179 organizations belonged to multiple coalitions. Organizations from the coal and electrical utility sectors were the most numerous and influential organizations in these coalitions. The article concludes with suggestions for further research to expand understanding of complex social movements and countermovements.

The climate was warmer than preindustrial times, with smaller ice sheets. Previous studies suggested that the Pacific ocean was stuck in a permanent El Nio" during the Pliocene. However, climate model simulations do not predict that this would happen at CO2 levels near 400 ppm  unusual changes in climate, such as large changes in cloud cover or hurricane frequency, would be needed to explain it. In this work we reanalyze Pliocene SST data and do not find evidence of a permanent El Nio. Our results suggest that difference in temperatures across the tropical Pacific was smaller than it is today, but only by about 1C. Climate model simulations agree with our new analysis, suggesting that higher CO2, along with small changes in ice, vegetation, and mountains, are enough to explain Pliocene climate. We also show that the SST patterns in the Pliocene Pacific Ocean look similar to those that climate models predict under a lowemissions climate change scenario. The similarity suggests that the Pliocene can help us understand how the tropics respond to an ongoing increase in CO2.  **Abstract**  With CO2 concentrations similar to today (410 ppm), the Pliocene Epoch offers insights into climate changes under a moderately warmer world. Previous work suggested a low zonal seasurface temperature (SST) gradient in the tropical Pacific during the Pliocene, the socalled permanent El Nio." Here, we recalculate SSTs using the alkenone proxy and find moderate reductions in the both zonal and meridional SST gradients during the midPiacenzian warm period (MPWP). These reductions are captured by coupled climate model simulations of the Pliocene, especially those that simulate weaker Walker circulation. We also produce a spatial reconstruction of MPWP Pacific SSTs that closely resembles both Pliocene and future, lowemissions simulations; a pattern that is to a first order, diagnostic of weaker Walker circulation. Therefore, Pliocene warmth does not require drastic changes in the climate system  rather, it supports the expectation that the Walker circulation will weaken in the future under higher CO2

Galaasen et al. report that episodes of reduced NADW over the past 500,000 years actually have been relatively common and occasionally long-lasting features of interglacials and that they can occur independently of the catastrophic freshwater outburst floods normally thought to be their cause (see the Perspective by Stocker). This discovery implies that large NADW disruptions might be more likely than we have assumed in the warmer climate of the future.   **Abstract**  Disrupting North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) ventilation is a key concern in climate projections. We use (sub)centennially resolved bottom water 13C records that span the interglacials of the last 0.5 million years to assess the frequency of and the climatic backgrounds capable of triggering large NADW reductions. Episodes of reduced NADW in the deep Atlantic, similar in magnitude to glacial events, have been relatively common and occasionally long-lasting features of interglacials. NADW reductions were triggered across the range of recent interglacial climate backgrounds, which demonstrates that catastrophic freshwater outburst floods were not a prerequisite for large perturbations. Our results argue that large NADW disruptions are more easily achieved than previously appreciated and that they occurred in past climate conditions similar to those we may soon face.

It doesn't deny or disprove claims about the impact of Climate Change at all.  In fact, it states, as I quoted above, that human activity like reclamation are the primary sources of the increasing island land area.  Here's another statement from your link:  "As global temperatures rise, the melting of glaciers and the thermal expansion of seawater are leading to a continuous rise in sea levels, posing serious risks for low-lying island nations, including coastal erosion, flooding and saltwater intrusion into inland areas. These direct threats not only jeopardize the safety of residents and the integrity of ecosystems but also have detrimental effects on infrastructure, housing, national economies and social progress (Martyr-Koller et al. Citation2021; Nienhuis and Lorenzo-Trueba Citation2019; Tuck et al. Citation2019). Additionally, the increased frequency of storm surges and extreme weather events presents further risks to these nations. Climate change is associated with stronger storms and unpredictable precipitation patterns, increasing the vulnerability of coastal areas (Hossain et al. Citation2022b; Mondal et al. Citation2021). The resulting impact of tsunamis and powerful ocean waves can cause extensive destruction, while subsequent flooding threatens urban areas, agricultural lands, and critical infrastructure, as well as the safety and livelihoods of residents (Ayyad, Hajj, and Marsooli Citation2023; Fuhrmann, Wood, and Rodgers Citation2019; Houser, Wernette, and Weymer Citation2018)."

2020-08-10 22:46:28, 0.261188242271255, reddit_opinion_climate_change.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: Study (open access): [Large stocks of peatland carbon and nitrogen are vulnerable to permafrost thaw](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/04/1916387117) _________________  **Significance**  Over many millennia, northern peatlands have accumulated large amounts of carbon and nitrogen, thus cooling the global climate. Over shorter timescales, peatland disturbances can trigger losses of peat and release of greenhouses gases. Despite their importance to the global climate, peatlands remain poorly mapped, and the vulnerability of permafrost peatlands to warming is uncertain. This study compiles over 7,000 field observations to present a data-driven map of northern peatlands and their carbon and nitrogen stocks. We use these maps to model the impact of permafrost thaw on peatlands and find that warming will likely shift the greenhouse gas balance of northern peatlands. At present, peatlands cool the climate, but anthropogenic warming can shift them into a net source of warming.  **Abstract**  Northern peatlands have accumulated large stocks of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but their spatial distribution and vulnerability to climate warming remain uncertain. Here, we used machine-learning techniques with extensive peat core data (n > 7,000) to create observation-based maps of northern peatland C and N stocks, and to assess their response to warming and permafrost thaw. We estimate that northern peatlands cover 3.7  0.5 million km2 and store 415  150 Pg C and 10  7 Pg N. Nearly half of the peatland area and peat C stocks are permafrost affected. Using modeled global warming stabilization scenarios (from 1.5 to 6 C warming), we project that the current sink of atmospheric C (0.10  0.02 Pg Cy1) in northern peatlands will shift to a C source as 0.8 to 1.9 million km2 of permafrost-affected peatlands thaw. The projected thaw would cause peatland greenhouse gas emissions equal to 1% of anthropogenic radiative forcing in this century. The main forcing is from methane emissions (0.7 to 3 Pg cumulative CH4-C) with smaller carbon dioxide forcing (1 to 2 Pg CO2-C) and minor nitrous oxide losses. We project that initial CO2-C losses reverse after 200 y, as warming strengthens peatland C-sinks. We project substantial, but highly uncertain, additional losses of peat into fluvial systems of 10 to 30 Pg C and 0.4 to 0.9 Pg N. The combined gaseous and fluvial peatland C loss estimated here adds 30 to 50% onto previous estimates of permafrost-thaw C losses, with southern permafrost regions being the most vulnerable.

In many cases, abrupt changes arise from slow changes in one component of the Earth system that eventually pass a critical threshold, or tipping point, after which impacts cascade through coupled climateecologicalsocial systems. The chance of detecting abrupt changes and tipping points increases with the length of observations. The geological record provides the only long-term information we have on the conditions and processes that can drive physical, ecological and social systems into new states or organizational structures that may be irreversible within human time frames. Here, we use well-documented abrupt changes of the past 30kyr to illustrate how their impacts cascade through the Earth system. We review useful indicators of upcoming abrupt changes, or early warning signals, and provide a perspective on the contributions of palaeoclimate science to the understanding of abrupt changes in the Earth system.

Promotional campaigns in the service of a corporations position toward environmental issues such as climate change are prevalent in the oil and gas sectors, where corporate image is seen as a valuable asset in managing risk, controlling negative media attention, and overcoming resistance by antagonistic civil society groups. This article assesses advertising expenditures by five major oil and gasoline companies for the time period 1986 to 2015. We examine four major factors that may influence spending on advertising by the oil and gas sectors: (1) the overall reputation of the oil and gas sector; (2) congressional attention to climate change; (3) media attention to climate change; and (4) a series of control variables including major oil spills, the publication of major climate change reports, overall public concern about climate change, GDP, and oil prices. We find that the factors that most influence corporate promotional spending are media coverage and congressional attention to the issue of climate change.

These experts agree that climate has affected organized armed conflict within countries. However, other drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more influential, and the mechanisms of climateconflict linkages remain a key uncertainty. Intensifying climate change is estimated to increase future risks of conflict.

If this global warming range is exceeded, potential tipping elements such as the Greenland Ice Sheet and Amazon rainforest may be at increasing risk of crossing critical thresholds. This raises the question of how much this risk is amplified by increasing overshoot magnitude and duration. Here we investigate the danger for tipping under a range of temperature overshoot scenarios using a stylized network model of four interacting climate tipping elements. Our model analysis reveals that temporary overshoots can increase tipping risks by up to 72% compared with non-overshoot scenarios, even when the long-term equilibrium temperature stabilizes within the Paris range. Our results suggest that avoiding high-end climate risks is possible only for low-temperature overshoots and if long-term temperatures stabilize at or below todays levels of global warming.

This study links species-specific water requirements for cooling body temperature to the collapse of a Mojave Desert bird community over the past century from climate change. Species occupying the hottest, driest sites were less likely to persist. Birds with the greatest water requirements for cooling their body temperature experienced the largest declines. Large-bodied carnivores and insectivores were especially vulnerable to cooling costs because they obtain water primarily from their food. Climate warming increases the evaporative cooling demand for birds, which will affect geographic patterns in body size and future extinction risk.  **Abstract**  Climate change threatens global biodiversity by increasing extinction risk, yet few studies have uncovered a physiological basis of climate-driven species declines. Maintaining a stable body temperature is a fundamental requirement for homeothermic animals, and water is a vital resource that facilitates thermoregulation through evaporative cooling, especially in hot environments. Here, we explore the potential for thermoregulatory costs to underlie the community collapse of birds in the Mojave Desert over the past century in response to climate change. The probability of persistence was lowest for species occupying the warmest and driest sites, which imposed the greatest cooling costs. We developed a general model of heat flux to evaluate whether water requirements for evaporative cooling contributed to species declines by simulating thermoregulatory costs in the Mojave Desert for 50 bird species representing the range of observed declines. Bird species declines were positively associated with climate-driven increases in water requirements for evaporative cooling and exacerbated by large body size, especially for species with animal-based diets. Species exhibiting reductions in body size across their range saved up to 14% in cooling costs and experienced less decline than species without size reductions, suggesting total cooling costs as a mechanism underlying Bergmanns rule. Reductions in body size, however, are unlikely to offset the 50 to 78% increase in cooling costs threatening desert birds from future climate change. As climate change spreads warm, dry conditions across the planet, water requirements are increasingly likely to drive population declines, providing a physiological basis for climate-driven extinctions.

The origin of my question is that I have been reading a lot about seaweed and that it takes a lot more CO2 out of the atmosphere than for example trees. I was wondering if starting a seaweed company for consumption will be a good idea to get a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere. And I was wondering that if I grow (lets say 1 m3 seaweed), it will take CO2 out of the atmosphere. But when I eat that same 1 m3 seaweed, will I emit the same amount that it took out of the atmosphere when it was growing? Will there be a net win for the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere?  Because if so, that would be a massive thing if you can scale it up and get people to eat seaweed a lot.   And when I compare seaweed to lettuce, will I emit more CO2 with eating seaweed than eating lettuce, when seaweed takes more CO2 out of the atmosphere than lettuce (per 1 m3)?   Thanks in advance!

He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down.   His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done.   He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. As ye sow, so shall ye reap, he counseled one and all, and everyone said, Amen.

The main causes for glacial and interglacial periods are variations in the movement of Earth around the Sun.\[24\] The astronomical components, discovered by the Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milankovi and now known as Milankovitch cycles, include the axial tilt of Earth, the orbital eccentricity (or shape of the orbit), and the precession (or wobble) of Earth's rotation. The tilt of the axis tends to fluctuate from 21.5 to 24.5 and back every 41,000 years on the vertical axis. The change actually affects the seasonality on Earth since a change in solar radiation hits certain areas of the planet more often on a higher tilt, and a lower tilt creates a more even set of seasons worldwide. The changes can be seen in ice cores, which also contain evidence that during glacial times (at the maximum extension of the ice sheets), the atmosphere had lower levels of carbon dioxide. That may be caused by the increase or the redistribution of the acid-base balance with bicarbonate and carbonate ions that deals with alkalinity. During an icehouse period, only 20% of the time is spent in interglacial, or warmer times.\[24\] Model simulations suggest that the current interglacial climate state will continue for at least another 100,000 years because of CO2 emissions, including the complete deglaciation of the Northern Hemisphere.\[25\]  &#x200B;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse\_and\_icehouse\_Earth

Card draws throughout the game add variables to gameplay such as moving your gamepiece forward or backward, subjecting you to Russian disinformation, or secretly making some of the other players into MAGAts.    3. The object of the game is for the Biden player to help as many people as possible before the other players undo the help, within the given time frame.  Doing so allows you to be the Biden player for the next round, otherwise the next person becomes the Biden player.  4. There will be times when, via card draw or landing on certain spaces on the board, some players will attempt to undo their own help.  5. The game ends when all players have been the Biden player but each player can only be the Biden player twice in one game.

This may change under greenhouse warming, but the mechanisms remain uncertain, thus limiting our ability to predict future changes in climate extremes. Using climate model simulations, we uncover the emergence of a mode of climate variability capable of generating unprecedented sea surface temperature and rainfall fluctuations across the IO. This mode, which is inhibited under present-day conditions, becomes active in climate states with a shallow thermocline and vigorous upwelling, consistent with the predictions of continued greenhouse warming. These predictions are supported by modeling and proxy evidence of an active mode during glacial intervals that favored such a state. Because of its impact on hydrological variability, the emergence of such a mode would become a first-order source of climate-related risks for the densely populated IO rim.

Although science suggests that [temperatures will stop rising when we stop emitting CO2](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/), the sad fact is that even on a 1.5C-compatible pathway, we'll keep hearing news stories like this for a while.

Here, we present transient simulations of coevolution of climate, ice sheets, and carbon cycle over the past 3 million years. We show that a gradual lowering of atmospheric CO and regolith removal are essential to reproduce the evolution of climate variability over the Quaternary. The long-term CO decrease leads to the initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation and an increase in the amplitude of glacial-interglacial variations, while the combined effect of CO decline and regolith removal controls the timing of the transition from a 41,000- to 100,000-year world. Our results suggest that the current CO concentration is unprecedented over the past 3 million years and that global temperature never exceeded the preindustrial value by more than 2C during the Quaternary.

Here, we tested for the population-genetic impacts of reduced sea ice cover on the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) sampled across two decades (19952016) from the Svalbard Archipelago, Norway, an area that is affected by rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic Barents Sea. We analysed genetic variation at 22 microsatellite loci for 626 polar bears from four sampling areas within the archipelago. Our results revealed a 310% loss of genetic diversity across the study period, accompanied by a near 200% increase in genetic differentiation across regions. These effects may best be explained by a decrease in gene flow caused by habitat fragmentation owing to the loss of sea ice coverage, resulting in increased inbreeding of local polar bears within the focal sampling areas in the Svalbard Archipelago. This study illustrates the importance of genetic monitoring for developing adaptive management strategies for polar bears and other ice-dependent species.

Testing this hypothesis has proved challenging due to the difficulty of developing in situ records of ice sheet and environmental change spanning warm periods. We present a multiproxy record that implies loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Last Interglacial (129,000 to 116,000 y ago), associated with ocean warming and the release of greenhouse gas methane from marine sediments. Our ice sheet modeling predicts that Antarctica may have contributed several meters to global sea level at this time, suggesting that this ice sheet lies close to a tipping point under projected warming.  **Abstract**  The future response of the Antarctic ice sheet to rising temperatures remains highly uncertain. A useful period for assessing the sensitivity of Antarctica to warming is the Last Interglacial (LIG) (129 to 116 ky), which experienced warmer polar temperatures and higher global mean sea level (GMSL) (+6 to 9 m) relative to present day. LIG sea level cannot be fully explained by Greenland Ice Sheet melt (2 m), ocean thermal expansion, and melting mountain glaciers (1 m), suggesting substantial Antarctic mass loss was initiated by warming of Southern Ocean waters, resulting from a weakening Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in response to North Atlantic surface freshening. Here, we report a blue-ice record of ice sheet and environmental change from the Weddell Sea Embayment at the periphery of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which is underlain by major methane hydrate reserves. Constrained by a widespread volcanic horizon and supported by ancient microbial DNA analyses, we provide evidence for substantial mass loss across the Weddell Sea Embayment during the LIG, most likely driven by ocean warming and associated with destabilization of subglacial hydrates. Ice sheet modeling supports this interpretation and suggests that millennial-scale warming of the Southern Ocean could have triggered a multimeter rise in global sea levels. Our data indicate that Antarctica is highly vulnerable to projected increases in ocean temperatures and may drive iceclimate feedbacks that further amplify warming.

Given that species ranges are closely allied to physiological thermal tolerances in marine organisms, it may therefore be expected that ocean warming would lead to abundance increases at poleward side of ranges and abundance declines toward the equator. Here, we report a global analysis of abundance trends of 304 widely distributed marine species over the last century, across a range of taxonomic groups from phytoplankton to fish and marine mammals. Specifically, using a literature database, we investigate the extent that the direction and strength of long-term species abundance changes depend on the sampled location within the latitudinal range of species. Our results show that abundance increases have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the poleward side of species ranges, and abundance declines have been most prominent where sampling has taken place at the equatorward side of species ranges. These data provide evidence of omnipresent large-scale changes in abundance of marine species consistent with warming over the last century and suggest that adaptation has not provided a buffer against the negative effects of warmer conditions at the equatorward extent of species ranges. On the basis of these results, we suggest that projected sea temperature increases of up to 1.5C over pre-industrial levels by 2050 will continue to drive latitudinal abundance shifts in marine species, including those of importance for coastal livelihoods.

Our current agricultural systems  with emphasis on intensive monoculture practices  and globalized markets drive the emergence and spread of new pathogens and problematic traits, such as fungicide resistance. Climate change further promotes the emergence of pathogens on new crops and in new places. Here we review the factors affecting the introduction and spread of pathogens and current disease control strategies, illustrating these with the historic example of the Irish potato famine and contemporary examples of soybean rust, wheat blast and blotch, banana wilt and cassava root rot. Our Review looks to the future, summarizing what we see as the main challenges and knowledge gaps, and highlighting the direction that research must take to face the challenge of emerging crop pathogens.

By evaluating 149 spring wheat lines in the field under yield potential and heat stressed conditions, we demonstrate how strategic integration of exotic material significantly increases yield under heat stress compared to elite lines, with no significant yield penalty under favourable conditions. Genetic analyses reveal three exotic-derived genetic loci underlying this heat tolerance which together increase yield by over 50% and reduce canopy temperature by approximately 2C. We identified an Ae. tauschii introgression underlying the most significant of these associations and extracted the introgressed Ae. tauschii genes, revealing candidates for further dissection. Incorporating these exotic alleles into breeding programmes could serve as a pre-emptive strategy to produce high yielding wheat cultivars that are resilient to the effects of future climatic uncertainty.

I dont know if alien life exists because there is no proof one direction or the other, but I believe it does because from a logical standpoint, it happening only once in the unfathomable number of opportunities for it to happen is less likely than it happening more than once. I dont think we could ever know it doesnt, but if we could really figure out a good explanation of the conditions that allow abiogenesis, we could reasonably extrapolate a probability for it happening multiple times, and if thy probability is high enough, we could reasonably know it with a similar certainty to other things we know even when not directly observing them.   Saying I dont know if it exists is more reasonable than saying I know it exists or I know it doesnt, but thats not the question as posed.   As an aside, the Drake Equation has almost nothing to do with whether life exists anywhere in the universe, and in this context would only serve to highlight that we cant solve the equation because we really have no idea in what to plug in for F1.

Because different models can lead to divergent conclusions about marine futures, we present an integrated global ocean assessment of climate change impacts using an ensemble of multiple climate and ecosystem models. It reveals that global marine animal biomass will decline under all emission scenarios, driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production. Notably, climate change impacts are amplified at higher food web levels compared with phytoplankton. Our ensemble projections provide the most comprehensive outlook on potential climate-driven ecological changes in the global ocean to date and can inform adaptive management and conservation of marine resources under climate change.  **Abstract**  While the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5% (4% SD) under low emissions and 17% (11% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5% decline for every 1 C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends.

The EC electors are chosen directly by the parties, so they would certainly be controlled by the parties regardless of how many of them there are.

On 10^45 yr time scale the geomagnetic field (GF) is the main controller of GCR flux.   A 3.6 Myr-long record of GF intensity shows no correlation with paleoclimate proxy records. ____  ***Abstract***  Changes in Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) flux have been proposed by some as the main factor controlling Earth's climate. This hypothesis, which invokes enhanced formation of low clouds due to ionization of atmospheric aerosol by GCR flux as a control mechanism, implies that climate sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 levels is overestimated. Here we propose to test this conjecture by comparing a deep-time 3.6 million yearlong (~3026.4 million years ago) record of global climate changes with a proxy record of geomagnetic paleointensity fluctuations. At the time scale adopted for this study, the geomagnetic field intensity is the major controller of GCR reaching the Earth. We compare the records of paleointensity, as a proxy for GCR flux fluctuations, and a record of global climate showing that they are substantially independent. We conclude that, the putative role of GCR flux as a cause for medium to long term (10^(35) yr) changes in Earth's climate is not supported by evidence. ____  ***1. Introduction***  Several studies have proposed a possible influence of variations in the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) flux on Earth's climate, on the basis of an observed correlation between the amount of (GCR) flux reaching the atmosphere and average cloud cover on decadal (Svensmark and Friis-Christensen, 1997; Marsh and Svensmark, 2000) and weekly timescales (Svensmark et al., 2016). Yet, other studies found no evidence for such a GCR-cloud correlation and discussed the possibility that methodological differences lead to different results (e.g. Laken et al., 2012).  More recently, experimental testing of the direct influence of GCR on cloud formation through the CLOUD experiment provided evidence for a very weak direct influence of GCR on cloud formation (Pierce, 2017). Although that study did not entirely excluding the possibility of indirect mechanisms, i.e. through a control on the global electric circuit (Tinsley and Zhou, 2015) and/or on the concentration of ozone close to the tropopause (Krivolutsky and Repnev, 2012). Indeed, different authors have proposed a connection between periods of higher solar activity  thus lower GCR flux , and warmer climate intervals over periods of 100200 kyr (Sharma, 2002; Christl et al., 2004) and during the last millennia (Usoskin et al., 2005) suggesting that effects induced by cosmic rays may affect longer-term changes in terrestrial climate.  On longer time scale (10^(46) yr), GCR variations are influenced by processes external to the heliosphere such as interstellar environment changes (Yabushita and Allen, 1998) or galaxy spiral arm crossings (Shaviv, 2003). On these grounds, a correlation between cosmic ray fluxes, inferred from measurements in meteorites, and occurrence of glacial ages in the last 150 Myr, has been claimed as an unambiguous evidence for a control of GCR on climate (Shaviv, 2002; Shaviv, 2003). However, flaws in the handling of different physical data have been evidenced by (Laut, 2003).  One way to indirectly test their potential effect of on climate is by comparing lateral or temporal variations in the intensity of the geomagnetic field to atmospheric and/or climate conditions. The geomagnetic field, in fact, has a considerable shielding effect on GCR (Walker, 1979; Smart and Shea, 2009). In the modern era, the cut-off rigidity (particle momentum per unit charge) varies from 0 through slightly <17 GV for particle vertical arrival direction (see also www.nmdb.eu).  A decrease in the geomagnetic field intensity of 1020% of the present day value would cause an increase of the GCR flux on our planet by 9070% (Wagner et al., 2000). For comparison, the integral GCR flux at 1 au varies by a factor of four, ranging from 4000 particles m-2 sr-1 s-1 at solar minimum through 1000 particles m-2 sr-1 s-1 at solar maximum (11-year solar cycle; Potgieter, 2013; Armano et al., 2019). During periods of negative solar polarity, when the global solar magnetic field (GSMF) lines of force emanate from the Sun South Pole, the flux of positively charged particles appears more modulated, up to 40% at 100 MeV n-1 at solar minimum, with respect to epochs of positive solar polarity (Boella et al., 2001; Grimani, 2004, Grimani, 2007). The same polarity of the Sun is observed every 22 years, on average.  The passage of interplanetary large-scale structures, such as high-speed solar wind streams and interplanetary counterparts of coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), cause short-term recurrent and non-recurrent GCR flux variations (of typical duration of <1 month; Cane, 2000, Richardson, 2004). A particle detector flown on the European Space Agency LISA Pathfinder mission between 2016 and 2017 allowed for monitoring the percentage change of the GCR proton (p) and helium (He) count rate (proportional to p and He fluxes) during this period of time (Armano et al., 2018 and references therein) and found that p and He nuclei constitute 98% of the cosmic-ray bulk in particle numbers to the total number. In space and above 70 MeV n-1, the GCR flux presents recurrent percent variations with respect to individual monthly averaged values of up to  7%. These variations show the same periodicities of the solar rotation period and higher harmonics.  Forbush decreases, generated by the passage of ICMEs, account for non-recurrent sudden drops of the GCR flux ranging between a few% and tens of %. Neutron monitors (NMs) have continuously monitored secondary particle final products of primary cosmic-ray (with energies >500 MeV n-1) interactions in the atmosphere (Cane, 2000 and references therein) since the early 1950s. In order to infer the GCR fluxes at the top of the atmosphere from NM data, nucleon observations and secondary particle production in the atmosphere are combined in the NM yield functions. NMs allow for a direct measurement of the GCR flux above effective energies (Ec) only. At energies > Ec the NM counting rate is proportional to the GCR integral flux incident at the top of the atmosphere. Ec range from 11 to 12 GeV for polar NMs through >30 GeV for equatorial stations (Gil et al., 2017). NM observations show sudden decreases in intensity >10% only during strong Forbush decreases (see for instance Cane, 2000).  From these observations, it can be concluded that at low latitudes, where insolation is maximal, the shielding effect of the geomagnetic field overcomes the role of both short and long-term GCR flux variations that result effective below 10 GeV-1 n. Consequently, in geological archives, if a (detectable) GCR effect on climate exists, evidence should be found by comparing paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic intensity records (e.g. Kitaba et al., 2017). Here we test this hypothesis by comparing a 3.6 Myr-long record of oxygen stable isotope,  a well established proxy for global paleoclimate change (e.g. Zachos et al., 2001) -, and Earth magnetic field paleointensity - as a proxy for the shielding effect - from ODP Leg 199 Site 1218 (Equatorial Pacific) during the early Oligocene (~26.430 Ma). Paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic records are derived from the same sedimentary archive and can thus be compared directly without the otherwise unavoidable uncertainty in the age model. ____  ***2. Material and methods***  ODP Site 1218 (853.378N, 13522.00W, water depth of 4811 m) is located in the central tropical Pacific (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). The Pleistocene and Miocene sedimentary sequence at ODP Site 1218 comprise two main sedimentary units. The upper 59 m consists of a Pleistocene to Middle Miocene brown clay unit with some nannofossils and occasional barren intervals (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). This upper clay unit is mostly made of wind-blown dust, clays, and radiolarians, some of which were reworked from older outcropping sediment. Below this brown clay unit, from 59 to 242 m composite depth, the section comprises nannofossils ooze and chalk of Lower MioceneOligocene age, which are the sediments examined in this study.  The complete magnetic stratigraphy, including rock magnetic analysis, of sediments from ODP Site 1218 were reported in (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005). Relative paleointensities of the Miocene-Oligocene section (from 50 to 140 mcd) of site ODP 1218 were studied by Channell and Lanci (2014) who have shown detailed rock-magnetic analysis. The reliability of Miocene-Oligocene paleointensity from Site 1218 was tested by comparison with coeval sedimentary record from ODP Site 1090 and IODP Site U1334 (Channell and Lanci, 2014). The three records from equatorial Pacific to South Atlantic gave very similar results implying that observed relative paleointensity represent a global signal.  The portion of ODP Site 1218 examined in this paper range from about 130 m to 190 m core depth. The sediments are Oligocene in age and have magnetic properties virtually identical to the overlying Miocene sediments and share the same reliability of paleomagnetic measurements.  At ODP Site 1218, the magnetostratigraphy (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005) has successfully identified polarity reversals from the lower Pliocene to the lower and could be unambiguously correlated with the reference Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale providing a precise dating of the sequence. The studied portion of ODP Site 1218 is comprised within the top of chron C9n and the bottom of chron C11n.2n with only minor gaps due to sampling problems or core recovery breaches ([Fig. 1](https://i.imgur.com/iqjQr4M.jpg)).

However, potential changes in the blocking area (size), which can affect the spatiotemporal characteristics of the resulting extreme events, have not received much attention. Using two largeensemble, fullycoupled GCM simulations, we show that the size of blocking events increases with climate change, particularly in the northern hemisphere (by as much as $17\%$). Using a twolayer quasigeostrophic model and a dimensional analysis technique, we derive a scaling law for the size of blocking events, which shows that area mostly scales with width of the jet times the Kuo scale (i.e., the length of stationary Rossby waves). The scaling law is validated in a range of idealized GCM simulations. Predictions of this scaling law agree well with changes in blocking events' size under climate change in fullycoupled GCMs in winters but not in summers.

Marine heatwaves, defined as periods of anonymously high regional surface ocean temperatures, have also become common in recent decades. Laufktter et al. show that the frequency of these events has already increased more than 10-fold because of anthropogenic global warming, making marine heatwaves, which typically occurred once in hundreds to thousands of years in preindustrial times, likely to occur on an annual to decadal basis if the global average air temperature rises by 3C.  **Abstract**  Marine heatwaves (MHWs)periods of extremely high ocean temperatures in specific regionshave occurred in all of Earths ocean basins over the past two decades, with severe negative impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems. However, for most individual MHWs, it is unclear to what extent they have been altered by human-induced climate change. We show that the occurrence probabilities of the duration, intensity, and cumulative intensity of most documented, large, and impactful MHWs have increased more than 20-fold as a result of anthropogenic climate change. MHWs that occurred only once every hundreds to thousands of years in the preindustrial climate are projected to become decadal to centennial events under 1.5C warming conditions and annual to decadal events under 3C warming conditions. Thus, ambitious climate targets are indispensable to reduce the risks of substantial MHW impacts.

However, the idealistic vision presented by the OP is, unfortunately, infeasible. No nuclear weapons state that successfully created its own nuclear weapon has ever disarmed. Further, non-hostile countries probably should *not* disarm, & certainly not unilaterally, lest we be left with a world where only hostile powers possess the world's most dangerous weapons.  The best approach is, IMO, a) risk mitigation to avoid "misunderstanding" that could result in catastrophic escalation. b) global monitoring & control of nuclear fuel supply chain. c) agreement among nuclear powers to limit deployed weapons to "reasonable" numbers (which will still be mind-numbingly high). d) economic sanctions regime to discourage would-be nuclear weapons states, proactively if possible.

In the paper your cited it says: "Approximately two-thirds of the total increase in atmospheric CO2 is a result of the burning of fossil fuels, with the remainder coming from SOC loss due to land use change (Lal 2004), such as the clearing of forests and the cultivation of land for food production." Additionally, I recommend reading the IPCC report on Climate Change and Land, there is a section dedicated to land degradation ([https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/)). In the executive summary it says " Better management of soils can offset 520% of current global anthropogenic GHG emissions." If you want to find more detailed numbers, this is a great place to start.   I also wanted to add another topic that is also commonly overlooked -- the carbon in our oceans. There is also a lot of carbon (aptly named "blue carbon") stored in coastal ecosystems and on the seafloor. Recently, a paper published in nature ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z?dom=microsoft&src=syn](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03371-z?dom=microsoft&src=syn) ) estimated the global emissions from seafloor degradation of trawling (a fishing method that drags weighted nets on the bottom of the seafloor) is nearly equal to global aviation emissions. This made headlines recently in this guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/17/trawling-for-fish-releases-as-much-carbon-as-air-travel-report-finds-climate-crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/17/trawling-for-fish-releases-as-much-carbon-as-air-travel-report-finds-climate-crisis)).  I think whether on land or at sea, both of these points highlight how critical nature-based solutions are. I don't know the exact figures but emissions from environmental degradation are comparable to the emissions from fossil fuel consumption. This is not even considering the other drawbacks of degrading the environment -- loss of biodiversity, ecosystem services, cultural heritage etc.  It is clear climate solutions requires eliminating human pressures and letting nature recover from generations of exploitation and ongoing destruction.

Bottom Line Up Front: I suggest to solve the problem you are looking at, start with addressing the following questions:  1. Question 1 - What does it take to make something? = Determine what is the supply chain for a single food product. Find out all the activities needed to produce/harvest, manufacture, package and transport the food product going from first production to end consumption.  2. Question 2 - What is the carbon cost to make something? = Determine what the carbon footprint calculated is for each of the above supply chain activities and the materials they use.  3. Question 3 - How are we calculating the carbon cost to make something? = Study the type of carbon accounting they used and its comprehensiveness and accuracy.  And scope the questions within two research topics:  1. Topic 1 = Supply Chain of Food Production  2. Topic 2 = Carbon Accounting of Supply Chains using Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) or other Carbon Accounting Methods (ISO 14064, Carbon Footprint Analysis (CFA), etc)  Some Preliminary Reading: - Carbon LCA vs CFA: https://howgood.com/state-of-research-lcas-and-carbon-accounting-for-the-food-industry/ - Supply Chain Carbon Accounting: https://supplychain.edf.org/resources/carbon-accounting/ - References to Carbon Accounting: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_accounting - ISO 14064 Overview:   -- Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_14064   -- EPA: https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/conference/ei16/session13/wintergreen.pdf  = Background: =  1. What you are asking for is more precise information on the carbon accounting of food that we buy and eat.  2. I am addressing your question as a quality engineer who has worked in quality management in a low-rate production environment.  I will be suggesting some of the methods to account and control quality for doing carbon accounting.  = Next Steps: =  Once you have a grasp of the supply chain and carbon accounting method to determine the carbon output of a food product, you can start to create accurate carbon data of food that you can report to a consumer on your app.

We challenge this notion by analysing climate velocity, which provides expectations for species range shifts. We find that contemporary (19552005) climate velocities are faster in the deep ocean than at the surface. Moreover, projected climate velocities in the future (20502100) are faster for all depth layers, except at the surface, under the most aggressive GHG mitigation pathway considered (representative concentration pathway, RCP 2.6). This suggests that while mitigation could limit climate change threats for surface biodiversity, deep-ocean biodiversity faces an unavoidable escalation in climate velocities, most prominently in the mesopelagic (2001,000 m). To optimize opportunities for climate adaptation among deep-ocean communities, future open-ocean protected areas must be designed to retain species moving at different speeds at different depths under climate change while managing non-climate threats, such as fishing and mining.

We analyzed sediment at the bottom of the Camp Century ice core, collected 120 km from the coast in northwestern Greenland. The sediment, frozen under nearly 1.4 km of ice, contains well-preserved fossil plants and biomolecules sourced from at least two ice-free warm periods in the past few million years. Enriched stable isotopes in pore ice indicate precipitation at lower elevations than present, implying ice-sheet absence. The similarity of cosmogenic isotope ratios in the upper-most sediment to those measured in bedrock near the center of Greenland suggests that the ice sheet melted and re-formed at least once during the past million years.  **Abstract**  Understanding the history of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is critical for determining its sensitivity to warming and contribution to sea level; however, that history is poorly known before the last interglacial. Most knowledge comes from interpretation of marine sediment, an indirect record of past ice-sheet extent and behavior. Subglacial sediment and rock, retrieved at the base of ice cores, provide terrestrial evidence for GrIS behavior during the Pleistocene. Here, we use multiple methods to determine GrIS history from subglacial sediment at the base of the Camp Century ice core collected in 1966. This material contains a stratigraphic record of glaciation and vegetation in northwestern Greenland spanning the Pleistocene. Enriched stable isotopes of pore-ice suggest precipitation at lower elevations implying ice-sheet absence. Plant macrofossils and biomarkers in the sediment indicate that paleo-ecosystems from previous interglacial periods are preserved beneath the GrIS. Cosmogenic ^(26)Al/^(10)Be and luminescence data bracket the burial of the lower-most sediment between <3.2  0.4 Ma and >0.7 to 1.4 Ma. In the upper-most sediment, cosmogenic ^(26)Al/^(10)Be data require exposure within the last 1.0  0.1 My. The unique subglacial sedimentary record from Camp Century documents at least two episodes of ice-free, vegetated conditions, each followed by glaciation. The lower sediment derives from an Early Pleistocene GrIS advance. ^(26)Al/^(10)Be ratios in the upper-most sediment match those in subglacial bedrock from central Greenland, suggesting similar ice-cover histories across the GrIS. We conclude that the GrIS persisted through much of the Pleistocene but melted and reformed at least once since 1.1 Ma.

This can cause the oceans to stop mixing, because the temp gradient keeps the air/currents moving, and thus cause the deeper waters to lose oxygen. This sets off a climate cycle of catastrophe that has sulfur/methane microbes in the low-oxygen waters grow and create anoxic oceans. The microbes release poison hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere as well. Life in both the oceans and on land is eventually suffocated and poisoned.   This complex cycle has been responsible for most of the mass extinction events in Earth's history.   But don't worry, our oceans aren't losing oxygen at an alarming rate. Beaches around the world don't smell like rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide). People around the world aren't suddenly getting sick (what are the symptoms of hydrogen sulfide poisoning anyway?)

He not only kept then in place, he expanded them for not only China, but for Canada and other western nations.  These tariffs not only directly and indirectly increase consumer facing prices, they also damage supply chains and undermine efforts to repair said supply chains. It's absurd these ridiculously broad tariffs haven't been lifted yet, considering the current state of supply chains and inflation. There is a reason why they haven't been used to this degree in  nearly a century; because they are completely self-inflicting, ineffectual and counterproductive to maintaining economic health.  Additionally, Trump's rational and mechanism for enforcing these tariffs was completely outside the scope of the power granted to the executive here, which is reserved for placing tariffs on nations that have directly declared war on the US.   Just like Trump, Biden, by default, is also abusing the power of the executive by enforcing said tariffs.

However, since electricity generation involves using fossil fuels, it is not established where and when the replacement of fossil-fuel-based technologies by electric cars and heat pumps can effectively reduce overall emissions. Could electrification policies backfire by promoting their diffusion before electricity is decarbonized? Here we analyse current and future emissions trade-offs in 59 world regions with heterogeneous households, by combining forward-looking integrated assessment model simulations with bottom-up life-cycle assessments. We show that already under current carbon intensities of electricity generation, electric cars and heat pumps are less emission intensive than fossil-fuel-based alternatives in 53 world regions, representing 95% of the global transport and heating demand. Even if future end-use electrification is not matched by rapid power-sector decarbonization, it will probably reduce emissions in almost all world regions.

Thus, although SG might reduce globally aggregated risks, it may increase climate risks for some regions. Here, using the high-resolution forecast-oriented low ocean resolution (HiFLOR) modelwhich resolves tropical cyclones and has an improved representation of present-day precipitation extremesalongside 12 models from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), we analyse the fraction of locations that see their local climate change exacerbated or moderated by SG. Rather than restoring temperatures, we assume that SG is applied to halve the warming produced by doubling CO (half-SG). In HiFLOR, half-SG offsets most of the CO-induced increase of simulated tropical cyclone intensity. Moreover, neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-SG when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes (SREX) region. Indeed, for both extreme precipitation and water availability, less than 0.4% of the ice-free land surface sees exacerbation. Thus, while concerns about the inequality of solar geoengineering impacts are appropriate, the quantitative extent of inequality may be overstated. ___  **Related Material(s)**:  Author's Blog Post: [FAQ on idealized solar geoengineering moderates key climate hazards](https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/blog/faq-idealized-solar-geoengineering-moderates-key-climate-hazards)  Author Video Summary: [Halving warming with idealized solar geoengineering moderates key climate hazards](https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/publications/halving-warming-idealized-solar-geoengineering-moderates-key-climate-hazards)  Chris Colose (NASA postdoctoral climate scientist) twitter thread discussing the paper: [here](https://twitter.com/CColose/status/1105222397853138947)  Jane Flegal (Adjunct faculty - ASU): twitter thread offering some criticisms: [here](https://twitter.com/DrJaneFlegal/status/1105143694057857024)

This current agreement is over 50 hostages lives saved, and none of Palestinian prisoners released killed anyone and are unlikely to kill more than 50 in the future. The way I see it is, it's better to save guaranteed lives than uncertain hypotheticals. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  This is a scary time with tough decisions. Israelis feel unsafe and are afraid of something like October 7th happening to their family in the future. You mentioned that you were Israeli, and I have heard from others before and I'm curious how people in general are feeling today about these hostage negotiations and these releases.

Possible analogs to climates from deep in Earths geological past have been suggested but not formally assessed. We compare climates of the coming decades with climates drawn from six geological and historical periods spanning the past 50 My. Our study suggests that climates like those of the Pliocene will prevail as soon as 2030 CE and persist under climate stabilization scenarios. Unmitigated scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions produce climates like those of the Eocene, which suggests that we are effectively rewinding the climate clock by approximately 50 My, reversing a multimillion year cooling trend in less than two centuries.  **Abstract**  As the world warms due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the Earth system moves toward climate states without societal precedent, challenging adaptation. Past Earth system states offer possible model systems for the warming world of the coming decades. These include the climate states of the Early Eocene (ca. 50 Ma), the Mid-Pliocene (3.33.0 Ma), the Last Interglacial (129116 ka), the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), preindustrial (ca. 1850 CE), and the 20th century. Here, we quantitatively assess the similarity of future projected climate states to these six geohistorical benchmarks using simulations from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model Version 3 (HadCM3), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2-R (GISS), and the Community Climate System Model, Versions 3 and 4 (CCSM) Earth system models. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, by 2030 CE, future climates most closely resemble Mid-Pliocene climates, and by 2150 CE, they most closely resemble Eocene climates. Under RCP4.5, climate stabilizes at Pliocene-like conditions by 2040 CE. Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerge first in continental interiors and then expand outward. Geologically novel climates are uncommon in RCP4.5 (<1%) but reach 8.7% of the globe under RCP8.5, characterized by high temperatures and precipitation. Hence, RCP4.5 is roughly equivalent to stabilizing at Pliocene-like climates, while unmitigated emission trajectories, such as RCP8.5, are similar to reversing millions of years of long-term cooling on the scale of a few human generations. Both the emergence of geologically novel climates and the rapid reversion to Eocene-like climates may be outside the range of evolutionary adaptive capacity.

Republicans see that something isn't quite right in the country. But they don't really understand systems. They see people's characteristics as mostly innate, because they aren't aware of how powerful cultural forces can be.  So they ask, "what's changed since the 1950s?" They don't understand how a system that worked before might not work now. They don't understand that America in the 1950s  was much less beholden to generational wealth than it is now, because there was less income inequality back then. They don't understand how oppressing minorities offers tangible benefits for the oppressors, even if the minorities are not inherently different from the majority.  No, they see capitalism as a simple sorting machine - the fittest among us get rich, and the least fit stay poor. They believe that propping up poor people means rewarding failure. And how do they know this? Because they see the so called "poor" people committing lots of crimes and not speaking "proper" English.   They don't ask why possessing marijuana is a crime, but dumping carcinogens into a river is not. They don't ask why welfare fraud is a crime, but differentially valuing Mar-a-Lago at $15 million and $1.5 billion is not. They're blissfully unaware that driving an SUV causes greater aggregate human suffering than mugging someone on the street. I could go on, but you get the point. They exist within a narrow framework of "good" and "bad," and we live in a society where "bad" things are almost exclusively crimes of the poor. Therefore, poor people are bad, and what kind of people tend to be poor? I'll let you figure that one out.   Fundamentally, it stems from ignorance. Ignorance of what constitutes "good" or "bad", and what makes people fall into those buckets. To them, "normal" is what they grew up with, and everything else is an aberration. And how can you argue with them? White men (read: productive, wealthy people) had its better back then, and America ruled the world as a result. (Obligatory /s.)

I hear a lot about different feedbacks. How are these included into the warming estimates? From the way you describe the estimate of uncertainty as a result of the variations in runs of climate models then a feedback has to be included in some way in the climate models to contribute to the uncertainty in warming, right? Is the cloud response you describe included in some way in the climate models that estimate warming? Do we include all the feedbacks we know of in some way into the climate models used to estimate how much warming there will be, or are any left out because we don't understand them well enough? Are any other feedbacks comparable to the cloud response in terms of how much they might effect warming or uncertainty, or is everything else pretty much small potatoes?  I'm also curious about what are the climate models used to estimate warming anyway? They are implemented as computer programs, right? Is their mathematical structure easy to describe?

It was quite good, and I would heartily recommend the book.  However, it does have some problems. The biggest is that it focuses too heavily on Jacques Maritain's Christian Democracy. There is no mention of the Protestant ideas behind Christian Democracy, and many Catholic figures, such as Frederic Ozanam are not mentioned. This meant that part I's chapters were sometimes too narrow in focus.  THAT BEING SAID, I would encourage you to read the book entirely. It is well worth it, and does provide a good description of Christian Democracy.  How Orthodox am I in my Christian Democracy? I agree with the major ideas of Christian Democracy. I do, however, reject parts of the 'socially conservative'  view of the family, that restricted women's role to the home. I find this to be an unbiblical restriction on women.

They are designed to prevent social interaction, and thus it follows thatby their very naturethey make the virtue of amity impossible.  But by virtue of the fact that we are not mere a mere biological existence, but true dignified persons, we possess a dignity that cannot be impinged upon. This dignity is expressed in the virtue of amity and love of neighbour as oneself.   Thus, lockdowns can never be justified, for by definition they violate the first principles of Christian Democracy.

If you stay your hand from saving someone because you're worried you'll be called an Imperialist, it doesn't make you a good person.   Let's say you bite hard into moral relativism, that you think any old metaphysic is as good as any old metaphysic. North Korea wants to have labor camps, hey, that's like their culture. The Colonial South wants to have slavery, hey, that's like, their culture. People in New  York like hotdogs, well, you know how it goes.   If you look the other way because it's difficult to take a stance, it doesn't make you a good person.   I understand what moral relativists want; it's impolite to speak down to others from a position of geopolitical power. It's impolite to be seen lecturing. It's all the more unfashionable when one can play religious or racial dynamics, to chastise the White West imposing its values on the rest of the world.   If you give up your seat at the table because you don't know what to do when someone calls you a racist, it doesn't make you a good person.   But either there's a better metaphysic out there which defends the caste system, which defends witch burning, which defends forced relocations and the stoning of women and the mutilation of children, or there's not.   If you let people suffer because moral relativism feels enlightened and it's an easy answer that lets you off the hook, it doesn't make you a good person.   That's the whole point of moral relativism; there are no good people, there are no bad people. And so, if that's the line you want to take, then there's nothing evil about our stepping in.

Such extremes unprecedented in the observational period often have substantial impacts due to a tendency to adapt to the highest intensities, and no higher, experienced during a lifetime. Here, we show models project not only more intense extremes but also events that break previous records by much larger margins. These record-shattering extremes, nearly impossible in the absence of warming, are likely to occur in the coming decades. We demonstrate that their probability of occurrence depends on warming rate, rather than global warming level, and is thus pathway-dependent. In high-emission scenarios, week-long heat extremes that break records by three or more standard deviations are two to seven times more probable in 20212050 and three to 21 times more probable in 20512080, compared to the last three decades. In 20512080, such events are estimated to occur about every 637 years somewhere in the northern midlatitudes.

Problem is by 1990s fatah became very corrupt as yasser arafat grew older and the conflict was starting to look more hopeless I guess, and so the palestinians saw them as sellouts for israel (which is mostly true at the time) so that brings us to the 2006 elections where hamas won because they promised to work for peace and clean up corruption when the plo has failed to do so.

He was always rude and aloof to everyone but the most insufferable of federalist society tools. He even snubbed some of them if they didn't have the "look." My class was full of his sycophants, conservative kids desperate to ride his coat tails to the Governor's Mansion or Senate. I know he took one guy with him to the Attorney General's office to do all the work for him, and then left him in Jefferson city to rot while he went to Washington.

However, only little is known about what kind of information users find when they are searching for information about climate science, climate change, and climate engineering on YouTube. This contribution presents results from an exploratory research project that investigates whether videos found on YouTube adhere to or challenge scientific consensus views. Ten search terms were employed to search for and analyze 200 videos about climate and climate modification topics, which are contested topics in online media. The online anonymization tool Tor has been used for the randomization of the sample and to avoid personalization of the results. A heuristic qualitative classification tool was set up to categorize the videos in the sample. Eighty-nine videos of the 200 videos in the sample are supporting scientific consensus views about anthropogenic climate change, and climate scientists are discussing climate topics with deniers of climate change in four videos in the sample. Unexpectedly, the majority of the videos in the sample (107 videos) supports worldviews that are opposing scientific consensus views: 16 videos deny anthropogenic climate change and 91 videos in the sample propagate straightforward conspiracy theories about climate engineering and climate change. Videos supporting the scientific mainstream view received only slightly more views (16,941,949 views in total) than those opposing the mainstream scientific position (16,939,655 views in total). Consequences for the public communication of climate change and climate engineering are discussed in the second part of the article. The research presented in this contribution is particularly interested in finding out more about strategically distorted communications about climate change and climate engineering in online environments and in critically analyzing them.

I like your description of Obama as a "masker" in the clinical sense.  I would also describe him as a *masquer* in the theatrical sense: a classical stage actor in a *masque*, a stylized drama in which actors wear masks.  I particularly remember when Obama was elected and everybody cheered and the myriad volunteers who got him elected were ready to help him build a new government of the people.  As I recall it, he brushed them aside saying "I got this" and promptly installed his Wall Street Team as you described.  I remember how much I liked Candidate Obama in 2008, especially when he promised us a Public Option "to keep the insurance companies honest".  Obama was attractive and eloquent when reading scripts, but lousy at anything impromptu.  His first 2012 debate with Mitt Romney was a disaster, and that would have ended it if Biden hadn't saved their relection with the VP debate in which he crushed Paul Ryan with snappy come-backs and a winning smile.

How everyone loves him and just the most positive things for any politician Ive seen in a long time.  So I tuned in to the debate. It didnt feel like two democrats squaring off. It sounded like a democrat (Bowman) facing off against a republican.  Its a shame because the anti-Bowman ads are slick and frequent, but as soon as Latimer actually starts talking he just does that non-committal double speak. But neighbors who voted for Bowman in the past have been saying hes turned bad and isnt the same and his mask has slipped. And again without watching the debates I would be inclined to think there was some truth, but I dont think Bowman has changed. So the ads seem to be working well for Latimer.  With the redrawing of this district I worry how its going to go.

According to the Sixth Assessment Report by Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this planetary warming over multiple decades is human-driven and results in unprecedented and committed changes to the Earth system, with adverse impacts for ecosystems and human systems. The Earth heat inventory provides a measure of the Earth energy imbalance (EEI) and allows for quantifying how much heat has accumulated in the Earth system, as well as where the heat is stored. Here we show that the Earth system has continued to accumulate heat, with 38161ZJ accumulated from 1971 to 2020. This is equivalent to a heating rate (i.e., the EEI) of 0.480.1Wm2. The majority, about 89%, of this heat is stored in the ocean, followed by about 6% on land, 1% in the atmosphere, and about 4% available for melting the cryosphere. Over the most recent period (20062020), the EEI amounts to 0.760.2Wm2. The Earth energy imbalance is the most fundamental global climate indicator that the scientific community and the public can use as the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing anthropogenic climate change under control. Moreover, this indicator is highly complementary to other established ones like global mean surface temperature as it represents a robust measure of the rate of climate change and its future commitment. We call for an implementation of the Earth energy imbalance into the Paris Agreement's Global Stocktake based on best available science. The Earth heat inventory in this study, updated from von Schuckmann et al. (2020), is underpinned by worldwide multidisciplinary collaboration and demonstrates the critical importance of concerted international efforts for climate change monitoring and community-based recommendations and we also call for urgently needed actions for enabling continuity, archiving, rescuing, and calibrating efforts to assure improved and long-term monitoring capacity of the global climate observing system. The data for the Earth heat inventory are publicly available, and more details are provided in Table 4.

In the near absence of proximal geological records from south of the Antarctic Circle, it is disputed whether polar ice could exist under such environmental conditions. Here we use a sedimentary sequence recovered from the West Antarctic shelfthe southernmost Cretaceous record reported so farand show that a temperate lowland rainforest environment existed at a palaeolatitude of about 82 S during the TuronianSantonian age (92 to 83 million years ago). This record contains an intact 3-metre-long network of in situ fossil roots embedded in a mudstone matrix containing diverse pollen and spores. A climate model simulation shows that the reconstructed temperate climate at this high latitude requires a combination of both atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of 1,1201,680 parts per million by volume and a vegetated land surface without major Antarctic glaciation, highlighting the important cooling effect exerted by ice albedo under high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  **Nature Video**: [An ancient Antarctic rainforest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSjWaz3XQc8)

Fossil fuel extraction and use are among the largest anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions, but the precise magnitude of these contributions is a subject of debate. Carbon-14 in CH4 (^(14)CH4) can be used to distinguish between fossil (^(14)C-free) CH4 emissions and contemporaneous biogenic sources; however, poorly constrained direct ^(14)CH4 emissions from nuclear reactors have complicated this approach since the middle of the 20th century. Moreover, the partitioning of total fossil CH4 emissions (presently 172 to 195 teragrams CH4 per year) between anthropogenic and natural geological sources (such as seeps and mud volcanoes) is under debate; emission inventories suggest that the latter account for about 40 to 60 teragrams CH4 per year. Geological emissions were less than 15.4 teragrams CH4 per year at the end of the Pleistocene, about 11,600 years ago, but that period is an imperfect analogue for present-day emissions owing to the large terrestrial ice sheet cover, lower sea level and extensive permafrost. Here we use preindustrial-era ice core ^(14)CH4 measurements to show that natural geological CH4 emissions to the atmosphere were about 1.6 teragrams CH4 per year, with a maximum of 5.4 teragrams CH4 per year (95 per cent confidence limit)an order of magnitude lower than the currently used estimates. This result indicates that anthropogenic fossil CH4 emissions are underestimated by about 38 to 58 teragrams CH4 per year, or about 25 to 40 per cent of recent estimates. Our record highlights the human impact on the atmosphere and climate, provides a firm target for inventories of the global CH4 budget, and will help to inform strategies for targeted emission reductions.

In defence of the British:  My understanding was that the Zionist movement was generally supportive of the partition because it allowed for the founding of a specifically Jewish state. Those Zionist groups that opposed it generally did so only because they felt it would jeopardize Jewish claims to the rest of historical Palestine.  It should be noted that Ben Gurion, subsequent Prime minister expressed his belief that a partition would only be the first step, providing a strategic foothold to eventually claim all of Palestine.  Furthermore Menachem Begin, another subsequent PM, opposed the partition and stated "Eretz Israel will be restored to the people of Israel. All of it. And for ever." Begin was, at the time, a leader in the Irgun Tsvai Leumi, a Revisionist Zionist Paramilitary organization that then committed the Deir Yassen massacre in 1948.

Lauvaux et al. used observations from the satellite platform TROPOMI to quantify very large releases of atmospheric methane by oil and gas industry ultra-emitters (see the Perspective by Vogel). They calculate that these sources represent as much as 12% of global methane emissions from oil and gas production and transmission and note that mitigation of their emissions can be done at low cost. This would be an effective strategy to economically reduce the contribution of this industry to climate change. HJS  **Abstract**  Methane emissions from oil and gas (O&G) production and transmission represent a considerable contribution to climate change. These emissions comprise sporadic releases of large amounts of methane during maintenance operations or equipment failures not accounted for in current inventory estimates. We collected and analyzed hundreds of very large releases from atmospheric methane images sampled by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) between 2019 and 2020. Ultra-emitters are primarily detected over the largest O&G basins throughout the world. With a total contribution equivalent to 8 to 12% (~8 million metric tons of methane per year) of the global O&G production methane emissions, mitigation of ultra-emitters is largely achievable at low costs and would lead to robust net benefits in billions of US dollars for the six major O&G-producing countries when considering societal costs of methane.

This deepening has previously been interpreted to reflect increased alkalinity supply to the ocean driven by enhanced continental weathering due to the Himalayan orogeny during the late Neogene period. Here we examine mass accumulation rates of the main marine calcifying groups and show that global accumulation of pelagic carbonates has decreased from the late Miocene epoch to the late Pleistocene epoch even though CaCO3 preservation has improved, suggesting a decrease in weathering alkalinity input to the ocean, thus opposing expectations from the Himalayan uplift hypothesis. Instead, changes in relative contributions of coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera to the pelagic carbonates in relative shallow sites, where dissolution has not taken its toll, suggest that coccolith production in the euphotic zone decreased concomitantly with the reduction in weathering alkalinity inputs as registered by the decline in pelagic carbonate accumulation. Our work highlights a mechanism whereby, in addition to deep-sea dissolution, changes in marine calcification acted to modulate carbonate compensation in response to reduced weathering linked to the late Neogene cooling and decline in atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide.

The Earth System Models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) generally project greater future warming compared with the previous Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) effort. Here we use four CMIP6 models and a selection of CMIP5 models to force multiple ice sheet models as part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). We find that the projected sea level contribution at 2100 from the ice sheet model ensemble under the CMIP6 scenarios falls within the CMIP5 range for the Antarctic ice sheet but is significantly increased for Greenland. Warmer atmosphere in CMIP6 models results in higher Greenland mass loss due to surface melt. For Antarctica, CMIP6 forcing is similar to CMIP5 and mass gain from increased snowfall counteracts increased loss due to ocean warming.  **Plain Language Summary**  The melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (GrIS and AIS) will result in higher sea level in the future. How sea level will change depends in part on how the atmosphere and ocean warm and how this affects the ice sheets. We use multiple ice sheet models to estimate possible future sea levels under climate scenarios from the models participating in the new Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), which generally indicate a warmer world that the previous effort (CMIP5). Our results show that the possible future sea level change due Antarctica is similar for CMIP5 and CMIP6, but the warmer atmosphere in CMIP6 models leads to higher sea-level contributions from Greenland by the end of the century.

I'm not sure that's the kind of conversation I'm interested in having - but I'll give it one attempt. Let's start with your first point:   > People think the word pollution is a synonym for greenhouse gases. It's gotten so bad that now we have the term conventional pollution to refer to...  I know not everyone is familiar with the messaging and public perception war that has been ongoing around this issue for the last thirty years but I'm sure you'll agree that we haven't been winning it. It's important that you first understand that there are three major buckets of players around this issue: 1-people advocating for action on the issue (scientists, advocates, and knowledgeable sane people) 2-the broad lay public who haven't been trained in science or educated on the issue (frequently and effective mis-educated and dis-informed, in fact) and, 3- the opposition (Kochs, API, ACC, Fox, etc).  The problem is that the lay public isn't trained on the science, and formal efforts to provide effective communications about climate to them are swamped and inundated by dis-information from the opposition, which has dramatically more powerful communications channels and techniques. The lay public has a difficult time discerning fact from fiction on this issue, and who could blame them? They haven't been equipped with science training or information, and they have state-of-the-art propaganda, marketing, and disinformation techniques of immense scale arrayed against them.   Here's how this has played out: initial understanding of global warming was buried by oil companies in the know, then, as academics and public researchers began to understand the problem they faced an uphill battle as they were trained to and were only communicating to students and other academics, hence their message had trouble gaining traction with the lay public. On the other hand, polluters hired Madison Avenue marketing firms and strategic communications consultants. Prominent scientists spent more than a decade with a knife at a gun fight, stubbornly speaking the wrong message from the wrong messenger to the wrong audience, while fossil fuel agents reached the right people in the right way such that awareness of global warming took a serious dip throughout the early-'aughts. These scientists wrung their hands, as you do, over being perfectly accurate and scientifically correct - while our opposition worried about being effective...  I'm not blaming these scientists, or others, but this issue has come a long way - and the twists and turns it's been through in the minds of the public are astounding. For example, the term 'global warming' had built an enormous head of steam (concern, fear) among the lay public around the time just before the first 'Inconvenient Truth' - but it was dashed by clever marketing: fossil fuel interests captured [a brilliant insight](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=72559699567970437507) from conservative messaging gurus, and dramatically moved away from the phrase 'global warming' - and to the phrase 'climate change'.  **Astoundingly, scientists and other pedants climbed aboard** (undoubtedly encouraged by provacatuers) because climate change is *technically* more correct. They just didn't realize they got tricked into losing all their momentum with the lay public...  This is all background and example; here's the point:  For decades the issue has been mired the unhelpful, jargon-y, and pedantic terms 'GHG emissions' and CO2, whatever that is... These terms inspire no worry, motivation, or anything other than a blank face from the lay public. Their eyes glaze over. You're almost as likely to hear that 'CO2 is what we exhale' or '*it's got what plants need*' when you mention it as you are to hear anything insightful - because of extremely effective opposition pr efforts. If you're waiting for *everyone* in the lay public to get a science degree so they can understand the nuance and be technically correct - then we're obviously dead in the water.   Well, finally, scientists and advocates are now getting smart: you know what term is universally reviled by the public? What term elicits a deeply negative connotation? **Pollution.**  Universally effective messaging.   So, scientists in-the-know and the greater movement have shifted dramatically to using resonant and effective messages, like 'global warming pollution' and 'coal-plant pollution' - to great effect, and let's hope it's not too late.   However, you still hear the sticklers saying, 'well, that's not *technically* correct...' and I ask them: "would you prefer to be technically correct and dead, or technically effective and alive?'  The lay public? Of course many people will get all this confused - but imo, you need to pick the right hill to die on. I might suggest your efforts at correcting people's technicalities may sometimes be better spent in other, more aligned ways. Mind you I'm not giving a pass to misinformation, but it helps to keep a sense of proportion and realistic expectations.   Ok - that's just a quick take on one single point. Again, I have similar concerns with almost every point.   Please receive this in the polite, friendly, and hopefully helpful tone as it is intended, and I'm happy to discuss further if you're interested. Also, and perhaps foremost, consider this information as coming from someone who works in this field and has *substantial* experience on this issue, as I have.   Also, I'm on mobile, so please excuse the numerous typos.

However, upscaling of sitelevel CH4 observations across diverse Arctic landscapes remains highly uncertain, compromising accuracy of current panArctic CH4 budgets and confidence in model forecasts. We report a 30,000km2 survey at 25m2 resolution (~1 billion observations) of CH4 hotspot patterns across Alaska and northwestern Canada using airborne imaging spectroscopy. Hotspots covered 0.2% of the surveyed area, concentrated in the wetlandupland ecotone, and followed a twocomponent power law as a function of distance from standing water. Hotspots decreased sharply over the first 40 m from standing water (y = 0.210.649, R2 = 0.97), mirroring in situ flux observations. Beyond 40 m, CH4 hotspots diminished gradually over hundreds of meters (y = 0.0040.164, R2 = 0.99). This emergent property quantifies the distribution of strong methanogenic zones from site to regional scales, vastly improving metrics for scaling groundbased CH4 inventories and validation of land models.  **Plain Language Summary**  Understanding Arctic methane emissions is crucial to forecasting the region's impact on global climate. Ongoing efforts suffer large uncertainties when upscaling emissions since direct observations rarely cover scales relevant to both processlevel (finescale) biogeochemistry and land models that operate on much larger scales. We bridge these scale gaps via highresolution airborne detection of methane hotspots (25m2 pixels) across a 30,000km2 study domain. We quantified a key spatial property of Arctic methane emissions: their power law dependence on distance to nearest standing water. From the ground, we verified that wideranging methane fluxes follow the same spatial power law pattern as domainwide hotspots. These conclusions can improve scaling of emissions in Arctic land models and potentially reduce the disparity between groundbased and atmospheric emission budgeting.

However, recent minor extratropical eruptions have produced a measurable climate impact, and proxy records suggest that the most extreme Northern Hemisphere cold period of the Common Era was initiated by an extratropical eruption in 536ce. Using ice-core-derived volcanic stratospheric sulfur injections and Northern Hemisphere summer temperature reconstructions from tree rings, we show here that in proportion to their estimated stratospheric sulfur injection, extratropical explosive eruptions since 750ce have produced stronger hemispheric cooling than tropical eruptions. Stratospheric aerosol simulations demonstrate that for eruptions with a sulfur injection magnitude and height equal to that of the 1991Mount Pinatubo eruption, extratropical eruptions produce time-integrated radiative forcing anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere extratropics up to 80% greater than tropical eruptions, as decreases in aerosol lifetime are overwhelmed by the enhanced radiative impact associated with the relative confinement of aerosol to a single hemisphere. The model results are consistent with the temperature reconstructions, and elucidate how the radiative forcing produced by extratropical eruptions is strongly dependent on the eruption season and sulfur injection height within the stratosphere.

Mid-latitude cyclones are a way to transport heat away from the subtropics, if there is more heat you need more transport in theory. However, the jet stream is controlled by the temperature difference between the poles and the subtropics, as the poles heat up, in theory the jet stream may slow. These are still theories because we don't have a long enough record to show definitely that these processes are occurring.   Many regions on Earth have different atmospheric compositions, not just in CO2. Depending on what the constituent is, you could or could not see local changes in the weather of the area due to its influence. For example, smoke alters clouds, leading to changes in their size and ability to rain, an example of how local pollution affects local weather. But as far as I know, differences of that magnitude in CO2 do not cause any local changes in weather.

Another would be the models themselves- research CIMP5/CIMP6 as they're important for climate sensitivity, though you already know this given you post them a lot.  I had Peter Kalmus [suggest this source](https://nca2014.globalchange.gov) as well to me recently.  As mentioned in a DM I sent you on /u/ClimateNurse (account isn't old enough to post here, alas!), [David A. McKay covers extraordinary claims here, some of which are from the XR](www.climatetippingpoints.info)  Avoid Wadhams and Beckwith, McPhereson as well. Make sure you emphasize on how global dimming works (I made a giant post about this on /u/ClimateNurse, it's rudimentary though, so it's not 100% accurate but it's a good place to get an idea of how it works.) I also covered the methane bomb/hydrates there.  Katharine Hayhoe has a massive YouTube channel backed by PBS called Global Weirding', and she tackles a lot of claims and ideas involving climate change.  www.skepticalscience.com is great, as is www.climatefeedback.org, as they address David Wallace-Wells 'The Uninhabitable Earth' and the recent think-tank report from Australia predicting the fall of civilization from 2050+.

But here is a cool little angle to think about if you do this thought experiment in class.  Our atmospheric carbon increase is significantly controlled by the amount of carbon the ocean absorbs.  So, for example, if we emit 100 units of CO2 into the atmosphere, the ocean absorbs some part of it (say 20 units) and the rest gets accumulated in the atmosphere. One of the assumptions of future climate change scenarios is that the ocean intake of CO2 will be proportional to how much CO2 we emit into the atmosphere. But recent studies have shown that the oceans change their CO2 absorption behavior according to the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. So, burning all your plastic at once wouldn't directly increase the atmospheric CO2 by a proportional amount. It will change how the oceans absorb that CO2 and what effect that has on ocean acidification and further chain reactions.  I know this is beyond what you are looking for, but I am just rambling here since it's an interesting thought.  EDIT: Minor mistake.

Two books in particular led me to begin questioning my belief system. One was called the race card and the other was called why Americans hate welfare. Simutaneously, I was associating with a lot of sociology and psychology researchers, and I knew that they took a great deal of pride in ensuring that their research was free of bias and reflective of the greater population. Data from these studies and the aforementioned books challenged my existing viewpoints on racism, crime, gender inequality and classism.

A year's average temp can be higher or lower than the long-term average for that year.

"The widely available global average temperature for a specific year isn't a suitable indicator for determining if the "Paris 1.5" threshold has been surpassed. The Paris Agreement focuses on long-term warming trends rather than yearly fluctuations. However, there has not been a formally agreed-upon alternative approach established yet.  "Clarity on breaching the Paris Agreement guard rails will be crucial. Without an agreement on what actually will count as exceeding 1.5 C, we risk distraction and confusion at precisely the time when action to avoid the worst effects of climate change becomes even more urgent."-  Richard A. Betts MBE, Study Lead Author and Head, Climate Impacts Research, Met Office Hadley Center  "Betts says, Using the average global temperature over the last 20 years would mean we would have to wait ten years to confirm whether the 1.5 C ceiling has been reached: creating a decade of otherwise preventable delay. Today we are recommending an indicator combining the last ten years of global temperature observations with an estimate of the projection or forecast for the next ten years. If adopted, this could mean a universally agreed measure of global warming that could trigger immediate action to avoid further rises.  The scientists found that the figure for the current global warming level is around 1.26 C using this recommended approach, with an uncertainty range of 1.13 C to 1.43 C."

During the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum at 9791Myr ago (Ma), a 3750-kyr-long cycle that is generally believed to reflect obliquity forcing dominates the sediment record. Here, we use a numerical ocean model to show that a cycle of this length can be generated by marine biogeochemical processes without applying orbital forcing. According to our model, the restricted proto-North Atlantic and Tethys basins were poorly ventilated and oscillated between iron-rich and sulfidic (euxinic) states. The Panthalassa Basin was fertilized by dissolved iron originating from the proto-North Atlantic. Hence, it was less oxygenated while the proto-North Atlantic was in an iron-rich state and better oxygenated during euxinic periods in the proto-North Atlantic. This redox see-saw was strong enough to create significant changes in atmospheric pCO. We conclude that most of the variability in the mid-Cretaceous oceanatmosphere system can be ascribed to the internal redox see-saw and its response to external orbital forcing.

Here, by using correlated scanning fluorescence X-ray microscopy and environmental transmission electron microscopy at atmospheric pressure, in operando, we directly observe that the (110) facet of a single Cu2O photocatalyst particle is photocatalytically active for CO2 reduction to methanol while the (100) facet is inert. The oxidation state of the active sites changes from Cu(i) towards Cu(ii) due to CO2 and H2O co-adsorption and changes back to Cu(i) after CO2 conversion under visible light illumination. The Cu2O photocatalyst oxidizes water as it reduces CO2. Concomitantly, the crystal lattice expands due to CO2 adsorption then reverts after CO2 conversion. The internal quantum yield for unassisted wireless photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol using Cu2O crystals is ~72%.

While people can upload pictures to social media, the army and police do not upload punishments to social media. Youd be surprised how often the army punishes soldiers, and it actually causes political issues on the far right wing.  2. I think Israel is in a unique situation, with many "firsts" from international law organizations. These organizations probably dont have jurisdiction, but they take unprecedented actions, leading people to think it's because they disapprove of a Jewish state.  3. Im sure some areas in Gaza are worse than others. There are wealthy areas as well, such as Rimal, where Hamas leaders live. Im not sure Ive ever seen a full report about hunger in Gaza or according to what hunger index. Its mostly news and warnings about famine, without any numbers.  4. Thats a tricky one. When people justify October 7, they justify Hamas's existence.  5. Thats just a fact. Combining morality and the military is generally a bad idea, but Israel is in a unique situation. Israeli soldiers have to live next to their "enemy" (terrorists hiding within civilian populations). Im not sure theres any other army that takes so many measures, even at the risk of its own soldiers, to avoid civilian casualties. I havent been proved wrong; yes, journalists and hostages getting accidentally killed is terrible, but mistakes happen in war. Most Israeli soldiers have died from crossfire in this war because of the urban nature.

Frankly, after all the damage Israel has wrought on the civilian population of Gaza, I feel like a ceasefire would only send a signal to Israel that they can use murder and destruction on the civilians as leverage in negotiation. That would be a complete and utter defeat for the idea of a free Palestine, as Israel will always have the greater ability to commit massacres on civilians. As disgusting as it is, I feel like due to the absolute failure of us as an international community, Palestinians only have a choice between continuing to resist, or submitting to slavery.

I mean, they literally had "Stop Bernie" meetings and did backroom deals to clear a path for Biden.   Dems fight harder in primaries against progressives than they do against Republicans in the general because Dems (and their donors) know that if enough progressives get elected they'll derail the gravy train.   It's not impossible for a progressive to win but it won't happen unless we figure out how to beat billionaires and the media and political machines they own. Need to figure out how to un-zombify the general public too. I mean, people actually bought the "Biden is the next FDR" line? Really!?

Hamas has adopted the cynical strategy of purposely increasing the number of civilian deaths, relying on international pressure that the deaths would bring to save them and force Israel to negotiate. They never went into this war with the goal of defeating Israel militarily.  As to the other point, there had been constant negotiations from the Israeli side up until Netanyahu got in and stopped seriously negotiating. It has been the Palestinian leadership that has rejected peace deals previously, going back to Israels founding. This is not even counting the years that Gaza/the West Bank were under Arab occupation.

Though they're Republican, most are not trump/fascism supporters, and have similar goals for public land, low income funding and other issues most Dems could agree with.   I vote primarily democrat, but have a hard time voting for a POTUS so lax on the genocide in Palestine, supporting terrorists in Israel. Biden also ran on preserving nature and land, yet approved the Willow Project (oil/gas in Alaska). Despite Reddit being a TikTok hating platform, I'm also upset Biden approved the ban. No POTUS should prevent free speech or the platforms used to do so.   I'm aware tRump would be worse, but I have decent principles and standards that I don't allow anyone to sway. I can't support a liar, so I may register as an Independent again after this election, assuming the USA still exists as a democracy and not a dictatorship.

Who are you to tell others that the purpose and meaning they find in life isn't real? Also, do you think any amount of pain overwhelms all of life's joys?  Most people are happy to be alive, because even with all of life's pain, it is worth it. Do you think people are lying about wanting to continue life?  3.

But even that is vague because it doesn't explicitly say you can't be president, doesn't define officer, and provides no test for whether or not a person has engaged in insurrection.

In all Palestinain majority cities that had a Jewish community theere, the community was attacked, and most of them destroyed.  The Jewish communities in the Palestinian cities of Tulkarm, Jenin, Nablus, Hebron and Gaza were all destroyed.    The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, collaborated with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.  When Husseini  met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in 1941, he assured Hitler that "The Arabs were Germany's natural friends because they had the same enemies... namely the English, the Jews, and the Communists". In the summer of 1940 and again in February 1941, al-Husseini submitted to the Nazi German Government a draft declaration of German-Arab cooperation, containing a clause:  "Germany and Italy recognize the right of the Arab countries to solve the question of the Jewish elements, which exist in Palestine and in the other Arab countries, as required by the national and ethnic (vlkisch) interests of the Arabs, and as the Jewish question was solved in Germany and Italy"

They should still be able to consume meat but they dont have to overconsume.

While I realized long ago that Thomas was just an unqualified self-hating Conservative shill, it didn't occur to me until this week that Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Coney-Barrett, while also being Conservative shills, also aren't that bright. I can't think of another group of justices in my lifetime who've displayed such a paucity of legal acumen. These guys are pulling bad law straight out of their asses, concepts like precedence and reliability be damned.                    And you're absolutely right about the baker who's case they allowed to come before the Court despite not having the legitimate standing to meet the "case or controversy" standard. We need to realize how much we're up against it when these folks and their promoters and supporters have no issue in doing this damage to democracy right in front of our eyes.

I've been tempted to post my thoughts, but haven't gotten around to it.  On this specific matter; I don't think it's fair to say that Australia has wage boards. I studied them a bit for my honours thesis, and Australian states phased them out during the 1910s, as the unions thought that compulsory arbitration worked better. What we have now is a combo of arbitration and collective bargaining, which set the different rates for different jobs.  To be honest, I think this error is due to the wide definition Dube uses:  >Potentially chosen using consultation with stakeholders, such as business and worker representatives and elected representatives  This statement can apply to both to wage boards and the Australian system of arbitration. There is a difference; in Wage boards, workers have substantial power. In arbitration, the arbitrator could be appointed by the business party, as is the current case in Australia.

But Democrats across the board are still much more likely to support policy that makes voting more accessible. Republicans are constantly introducing initiatives to make it more difficult to vote. Whether it's voter ID laws, voter role purges, fighting absentee voting, forbidding ballot drop boxes, cutting funding for elections, closing polling places, or insisting on single day voting, it's always Republicans proposing that shit.  So yeah, Democrats want to win and will try and drive voter engagement in a way that makes that happen, but they're still the ones making it easier to vote right now.

We examine the role of tipping between two such states in an excitable low-order ocean model. Ensemble simulations are used to obtain the models pullback attractor (PBA) and its properties, as a function of a forcing parameter  and of the steepness  of a climatological drift in the forcing. The tipping time ttp is defined as the time at which the transition to relaxation oscillations (ROs) arises: at constant forcing this occurs at =c. As the steepness  decreases, ttp is delayed and the corresponding forcing amplitude decreases, while remaining always above c. With periodic perturbations, that amplitude depends solely on  over a significant range of parameters: this provides an example of rate-induced tipping in an excitable system. Nonlinear resonance occurs for periods comparable to the RO time scale. Coexisting PBAs and total independence from initial states are found for subsets of parameter space. In the broader context of climate dynamics, the parameter drift herein stands for the role of anthropogenic forcing.  .............................................................................................................................................................  Study (open access): [Extratropical Low-Frequency Variability With ENSO Forcing: A Reduced-Order Coupled Model Study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002530) ______________________________________  **Abstract**  The impact of the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the extratropics is investigated in an idealized, reduced-order model that has a tropical and an extratropical module. Unidirectional ENSO forcing is used to mimick the atmospheric bridge between the tropics and the extratropics. The variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere extratropical module is then investigated through the analysis of its pullback attractors (PBAs). This analysis focuses on two types of ENSO forcing generated by the tropical module, one periodic and the other aperiodic. For a substantial range of the ENSO forcing, two chaotic PBAs are found to coexist for the same set of parameter values. Different types of extratropical low-frequency variability (LFV) are associated with either PBA over the parameter ranges explored. For periodic ENSO forcing, the coexisting PBAs exhibit only weak nonlinear instability. For chaotic forcing, though, they are quite unstable and certain extratropical perturbations induce transitions between the two PBAs. These distinct stability properties may have profound consequences for extratropical climate predictions: in particular, ensemble averaging may no longer help isolate the LFV signal.

It only provides a few instances where it directs how elections should be handled.

There is no remote-sensing method available to reliably monitor the permafrost thermal state. To estimate permafrost distribution at a hemispheric scale, we employ an equilibrium state model for the temperature at the top of the permafrost (TTOP model) for the 20002016 period, driven by remotely-sensed land surface temperatures, down-scaled ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data, tundra wetness classes and landcover map from the ESA Landcover Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Subgrid variability of ground temperatures due to snow and landcover variability is represented in the model using subpixel statistics. The results are validated against borehole measurements and reviewed regionally. The accuracy of the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost is 2 C when compared to permafrost borehole data. The modelled permafrost area (MAGT <0 C) covers 13.9  106  km^2 (ca. 15% of the exposed land area), which is within the range or slightly below the average of previous estimates. The sum of all pixels having isolated patches, sporadic, discontinuous or continuous permafrost (permafrost probability >0) is around 21  106 km^2 (22% of exposed land area), which is approximately 2  106  km^2 less than estimated previously. Detailed comparisons at a regional scale show that the model performs well in sparsely vegetated tundra regions and mountains, but is less accurate in densely vegetated boreal spruce and larch forests.

When you pick sides, you're really laying out the red carpet for these groups to do what they want to do and get away with propagating fear and anger while murdering or hurting innocent people, because that's what they want you to do.  It's not just Hamas that hates Jewish people. It's not just weird Muslim fanatical terrorist groups that hate Jewish people. It's not just redneck white folk that hate Muslims. It's not just Hindu extremists that hate Muslims.  I remember my best friend, a Jewish dude, telling me at the beginning of the pandemic about how anti-Semitism is a huge problem in North America. I didn't believe him, but I started watching interviews and videos online with a keen eye for REAL anti-Semitic diatribe, and it was there. Young white dudes at weird flat earther get togethers blaming George Soros and the "Jews", black moguls talking about "Jewish power" over the media and politics. Regular folks using stereotypes to make jokes that you could feel had more than a morsel of "truth" to them. I just hope y'all realize just like I did, Muslim people go through the same thing. They stay really quiet about it. But it happens on the daily, year round and it's been happening since before 9/11.  Don't be that kind of person. Don't be someone who looks for confirmation-bias as a means to live a life where you feel comfortable because your expectations for reality are always met in your own mind. That is exactly what REAL terrorists are hoping for. It's exactly what the ppl who empower those groups, and fund those groups rely on. They rely on what people consider to be "predictable outcomes". We need to smarten up. Someone needs to start smartening up, and if not us, then how long do we wait for someone else to do it? Just keep that in mind. There are people who will hate who you are, where you're from, what you do, no matter what. There are Jewish people like that. There are Muslim ppl like that. There are Christian ppl like that. Catholics, even evil Buddhists like that. There are agnostics like that as well. We don't know what the logic is for this hatred, but the more we focus on what we perceive to be predictable outcomes, the more we'll keep buying into them, the more we'll keep fighting and hating each other.

Maybe the rates at which women receive alimony and the rate at which men pay it is due to the fact that there is tremendous pressure on men to be providers and women are more likely to have to take time off of work because they need to recover from pregnancies. Whether or not the system is actually biased in favor of women, I am not sure, but that really is not the point. I edited out the part about gender bias, not just because I am unsure if the gender bias in the court system really is as common as the media will have you believe, but also because it does not matter. You do not need to make the case that the courts are biased against men to make a good case against alimony.

Proxies of deep circulation suggest a contemporaneous onset or strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Proxy evidence of gradual salinification of the North Atlantic and tectonically driven isolation of the Arctic suggest that closing the Arctic-Atlantic gateway could have triggered the AMOC at the EOT. We demonstrate this trigger of the AMOC using a new paleoclimate model with late Eocene boundary conditions. The control simulation reproduces Eocene observations of low Arctic salinities. Subsequent closure of the Arctic-Atlantic gateway triggers the AMOC by blocking freshwater inflow from the Arctic. Salt advection feedbacks then lead to cessation of overturning in the North Pacific. These circulation changes imply major warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, and simultaneous cooling of the North Pacific, but no interhemispheric change in temperatures.

In the last deglacial period, the rate of global sea-level rise peaked at more than 4cmyr1 during Meltwater Pulse 1A, which coincided with the Blling warming event some 14,650 years ago. However, the sources of the meltwater have proven elusive, and the contribution from Eurasian ice sheets has been considered negligible. Here, we present a regional carbon-14 calibration curve for the Norwegian Sea and recalibrate marine 14C dates linked to the Eurasian Ice Sheet retreat. We find that marine-based sectors of the Eurasian Ice Sheet collapsed at the Blling transition and lost an ice volume of 4.57.9m sea-level equivalents (SLE) over 500 years. During peak melting, 3.36.7m SLE of ice was lost, potentially explaining up to half of Meltwater Pulse 1A. A mean meltwater flux of 0.2Sv over 300 years was injected into the Norwegian Sea and the Arctic Ocean at a time when proxy evidence suggests vigorous Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Our reconstruction shows that massive marine-based ice sheets can collapse in as little as 300500 years.

We should ride this momentum and plan a mass action where we convince people to just go outside.    Go outside and look at the weather; feel how warm it is. Its probably really nice out, which feels good because its such a beautiful time of year, but it wasnt like this 50 years ago. It wasnt like this 20 years ago, you know that. The last five years have been the hottest on record and because of this, wildlife populations are crashing.    Whatever you think is causing it, it doesnt matter, the world is changing and we need to react now. And there are a lot of elitist fucks that spend a lot of fucking money making sure you dont realize that.

We applied five different statistical methods to reconstruct the GMST of the past 12,000 years (Holocene). Each method used different approaches to averaging the globally distributed time series and to characterizing various sources of uncertainty, including proxy temperature, chronology and methodological choices. The results were aggregated to generate a multi-method ensemble of plausible GMST and latitudinal-zone temperature reconstructions with a realistic range of uncertainties. The warmest 200-year-long interval took place around 6500 years ago when GMST was 0.7C (0.3, 1.8) warmer than the 19th Century (median, 5th, 95th percentiles). Following the Holocene global thermal maximum, GMST cooled at an average rate 0.08C per 1000 years (0.24, 0.05). The multi-method ensembles and the code used to generate them highlight the utility of the Temperature 12k database, and they are now available for future use by studies aimed at understanding Holocene evolution of the Earth system.

It's like walking into a burning building and arguing with the firefighters that the building should be using a different kind of fireproofing material. It's just not relevant at the moment.  Unless you can successfully convert all of the world's major economies to socialist governments that all agree on making climate change their top priority, and do it all within just a few years, this is an objectively unworkable strategy.  I don't advocate for a carbon tax because I love capitalism. I advocate for it because [scientists say we need a high price on carbon](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-2/) to solve climate change and because [there is already momentum behind carbon pricing in most of the developed world](https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/map_data). And because [carbon taxes work](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/addressing-climate-change-through-carbon-taxes/).  Despite my misgivings about unconstrained capitalism, it's clear that a socialist revolution on the scale you're describing will take far longer than we have to get climate change under control. I can feel like our current system sucks while still accepting that I need to work within it to solve the problem at hand within the time available.

Before the 1990s, most ocean temperature measurements were above 700 m and therefore, insufficient for an accurate global estimate of ocean warming. We present a method to reconstruct ocean temperature changes with global, full-depth ocean coverage, revealing warming of 436 10^21 J since 1871. Our reconstruction, which agrees with other estimates for the well-observed period, demonstrates that the ocean absorbed as much heat during 19211946 as during 19902015. Since the 1950s, up to one-half of excess heat in the Atlantic Ocean at midlatitudes has come from other regions via circulation-related changes in heat transport.  **Abstact**  Most of the excess energy stored in the climate system due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been taken up by the oceans, leading to thermal expansion and sea-level rise. The oceans thus have an important role in the Earths energy imbalance. Observational constraints on future anthropogenic warming critically depend on accurate estimates of past ocean heat content (OHC) change. We present a reconstruction of OHC since 1871, with global coverage of the full ocean depth. Our estimates combine timeseries of observed sea surface temperatures with much longer historical coverage than those in the ocean interior together with a representation (a Greens function) of time-independent ocean transport processes. For 19552017, our estimates are comparable with direct estimates made by infilling the available 3D time-dependent ocean temperature observations. We find that the global ocean absorbed heat during this period at a rate of 0.30  0.06 W/m^2 in the upper 2,000 m and 0.028  0.026 W/m^2 below 2,000 m, with large decadal fluctuations. The total OHC change since 1871 is estimated at 436  91 10^21 J, with an increase during 19211946 (145  62 10^21 J) that is as large as during 19902015. By comparing with direct estimates, we also infer that, during 19552017, up to one-half of the Atlantic Ocean warming and thermosteric sea-level rise at low latitudes to midlatitudes emerged due to heat convergence from changes in ocean transport.

Since then, we have thrown every drug company, and arm-chair analyst at it to "make it go away."  Here's the thing: great philosophers realized that anxiety was an essential part of human existence and necessary to promote growth/progress/achievement.   So, having an entire country (or the entire western world) fight a war against anxiety seems counterproductive and harmful. yet here we are - running away from anxiety and numbing ourselves to it with drugs.   To quote Kierkegaard:  >Learning to know anxiety is an adventure which every man has to affrontHe therefore who has learned rightly to be in anxiety has learned the most important thing.  I strongly urge you to read his "The Concept of Anxiety" it is fascinating, and will open your eyes to the productive power of anxiety.

I also think the people who want the US to cut ties with Israel is larger than just "Gen-Z Tiktokers". I see a huge coalition who are coming for the protests - the anti-war libertarians , "America First nationalists" , Gen-Zers, historically marginalised communities, and 2nd gen immigrants from formerly colonised countries.  This war has exposed much of the power and influence that Israel exerts on America, and vice versa. People are now digging deeper into lobbying groups like AIPAC and it's influence on the military industrial complex.  The Iraq war had similar anti-war protests all over the West and 20 years later people largely classify it as a neocon failure. They are weary of America's endless wars where there own citizens don't have free healthcare or education.  Israel continues to land in the cross-section of these different ideologies. We can't predict the future. But I tend to agree with you that as demographics shift voters will shift to a more conditional stance with Israel, so much so that indeed Israel might be more diplomatically isolated from its traditional allies.

To that end, countries agreed to reduce their emissions by nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Using a fully statistically based probabilistic framework, we find that the probabilities of meeting their nationally determined contributions for the largest emitters are low, e.g. 2% for the USA and 16% for China. On current trends, the probability of staying below 2 C of warming is only 5%, but if all countries meet their nationally determined contributions and continue to reduce emissions at the same rate after 2030, it rises to 26%. If the USA alone does not meet its nationally determined contribution, it declines to 18%. To have an even chance of staying below 2 C, the average rate of decline in emissions would need to increase from the 1% per year needed to meet the nationally determined contributions, to 1.8% per year.

Reliable LGM temperatures come from high-latitude ice cores, but substantial disagreement exists between proxy records in the low latitudes where quantitative low-elevation records on land are scarce. Filling this data gap, noble gases in ancient groundwater record past land surface temperatures through a direct physical relationship that is rooted in their temperature-dependent solubility in water. Dissolved noble gases are suitable tracers of LGM temperature because of their complete insensitivity to biological and chemical processes and the ubiquity of LGM-aged groundwater around the globe. However, although several individual noble gas studies have found substantial tropical LGM cooling, they have used different methodologies and provide limited spatial coverage. Here we use noble gases in groundwater to show that the low-altitude, low-to-mid-latitude land surface (45 degrees south to 35 degrees north) cooled by 5.8  0.6 degrees Celsius (mean  95% confidence interval) during the LGM. Our analysis includes four decades of groundwater noble gas data from six continents, along with new records from the tropics, all of which were interpreted using the same physical framework. Our land-based result broadly supports a recent reconstruction based on marine proxy data assimilation that suggested greater climate sensitivity than previous estimates.

Oxygen isotopes are from (Wade and Plike, 2004). Glacial episodes are also reported following the Oxygen isotope (Oi) event-naming scheme of Wade and Plike (Wade and Plike, 2004). The relative paleomagnetic intensity record is rescaled to the average value of the geomagnetic axial dipole intensity for the 0.3 to 33 Myr time interval of 4.8  3.5  1022 A m2 (Selkin and Tauxe, 2000). For reference, the present day dipole intensity of about 8  1022 A m2 is shown as a dotted line. Magnetostratigraphic scale is from (Lanci et al., 2005), absolute ages on the right axis are taken from (Wade and Plike, 2004). ____  ***3. Paleointensity record***  For the purpose of this study we have computed the relative paleointensity (B*) of geomagnetic field in 43 u-channel samples (continuous subsamples of split cores) from ODP Site 1218. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was normalized by isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). ARM was imparted to the u-channel samples with a 0.05 mT bias field and a 100 mT peak alternating field. IRM was induced with a 100 mT impulse field. Both ARM and IRM were subsequently measured at 1 cm intervals and subjected to progressive alternating field demagnetization. The measurement spacing of 1 cm, and AF demagnetization peak fields were chosen accordingly to those previously used for the NRM demagnetization (Lanci et al., 2004; Lanci et al., 2005).  Uniform magnetic properties were checked by inspecting the variability of ARM and IRM. Histograms with the distributions of ARM and IRM intensity, after a 20 mT AF demagnetization (Fig. 2a) show that 95% of samples are within a variability factor of about 4.2 for ARM and 5.8 for IRM, well below the limit suggested by (King et al., 1983). However, we adopted a conservative approach considering less reliable the samples comprised in the 0.25% tails of IRM and ARM intensity distributions and marked them appropriately in the paleointensity record. A further quality checks for the uniform magnetic grain-size along the sedimentary sequence was checked by the IRM/ARM ratio, which is remarkably constant along the whole sequence (Fig. 2b).  [Fig. 2.](https://i.imgur.com/FMcmdmI.jpg) a) Histograms of ARM and IRM intensity after AF demagnetization at 20 mT. Gray bands on the sides of the histograms indicate the 2.5% tails of the distributions, which have been considered as less reliable and removed from the record. b) The diagram of ARM vs IRM after AF demagnetization at 20 mT shows the constant magnetic properties of the sediments.  ARM and IRM were subject to stepwise alternating field demagnetization using the identical peak fields used in NRM demagnetization, then B* was computed by fitting a straight line between the NRM intensity and the normalizer intensity (Fig. 3) following an approach similar to that of the Arai plots (Tauxe, 1993). The angular coefficient of the best-fit line is taken as our best estimates B*.  [Fig. 3.](https://i.imgur.com/LlSZAFL.jpg) Pseudo-Arai plot for typical samples of the studied sections of ODP Site 1218. Sample code (e.g. 1218B-16H-2-69.0) follows the standard IODP labelling, i.e. site and hole-core-section-depth. A large correlation coefficient for the best-fit line between NRM and ARM is generally found in the for AF demagnetization field larger than 20 mT. The small offset of the best-fit line is interpreted as a consequence of a spurious magnetization acquired during NRM demagnetization, as described by (Lanci et al., 2005). Smaller dots represent the demagnetization path; larger dots represent NRM values.  and the correlation coefficient R is used to evaluate the goodness of fit, thus the quality of the data. To avoid an unwanted influence of soft component in the NRM, B* was calculated from the same alternating field demagnetization steps used for calculation of the ChRM directions, which ranges between 20 mT and 80 mT. We finally choose to use the ARM as normalizer for the relative paleointensity (B*) record, although very similar results were obtained using IRM, as shown in Fig. 1. The statistical independence between the normalizer (ARM) and B* have been positively tested at the 95% confidence level using a Fisher exact test (Agresti, 2007), on a 3  3 contingency table to ensure that the paleointensity record is not significantly influenced by lithology. The trend and the relative variability of our paleomagnetic results are comparable with the coeval relative paleointensity record from ODP Site 522 (Tauxe and Hartl, 1997).  The absolute value of the geomagnetic dipole moment is not essential to evaluate the variation of the shielding effect from GCR fluxes because of the linear dependence of rigidity cuf-off of cosmic rays and dipole moment (Strmer, 1930). However, we have rescaled the values of B* by dividing their average values by the 0.330 Ma average geomagnetic moment (Selkin and Tauxe, 2000) Compared to the data compilation (Guyodo and Valet, 1999) from the last 800 kyr (Sint800) when large climate changes occurred across glacial-interglacial cycles, the variability of the Oligocene rescaled paleointensity record is slightly larger ( = 4.4  10^22 A m^2 compared to  = 2.6  10^22 A m^2 for Sint800). ____  ***4. Paleoclimatic record***  Cenozoic climate revealed by multiple stable isotope (18O and 13C) records from oceanic sediments shows considerable variability reflecting longer-term (106 yr) and short-term (104105 yr) global fluctuations of ice-volume and/or deep-sea temperatures, and global carbon budget (Zachos et al., 2001). A detailed record of climate variability during the Early Oligocene is available from deep-sea sediments recovered with Equatorial Pacific ODP Leg 199. The oxygen stable isotope record from the continuous sedimentary sequence of Site 1218 suggests that major glacial episodes, occurred at 29.16, 27.91, and 26.76 Ma (Wade and Plike, 2004), providing evidence for a global climate change signal well above the noise introduced by potential problems related to the sensitivity and laboratory accuracy of the proxy. Large (5065 m) glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations corresponds to these events (Kominz and Pekar, 2001). Remarkable fluctuations in the Carbon isotope record suggest that major changes in the global carbon cycle were associated to these episodes of climate change (Wade and Plike, 2004). The benthic foraminiferal 18O record from Site 1218 is comparable with data obtained elsewhere (e.g. Zachos et al., 2001) implying that observed changes reflect a global signal.  The stable isotope stratigraphy provided by (Wade and Plike, 2004) for the stratigraphic interval between magnetochrons C9n and C11n.2n corresponding to ~26.4 Ma30 Ma based on astrochronology, represents the most detailed record of both short- (<0.5 Myr) and long-term (23 Myr) climate change during the Oligocene (Lear et al., 2004; Wade and Plike, 2004). ODP Site 1218 offers the possibility of directly comparing a high resolution record of relative geomagnetic paleointensity fluctuations, that we use as proxy for changes in GCR flux, with such a record of global climate changes. ____

Izzy isn't becoming "more hated" necessarily, but that Sean is simply rising in popularity so much that it seems like Izzy is becoming "more hated." Furthermore, Americans like humor when it comes to these things. Strickland's trash talk and statements are so absurd that people find it hilarious (which naturally draws people in). Whereas, Izzy has never really been that "funny" in the sense that his trash talk is less absurd.  Now, the polarization can be true to an extent given the things Sean says. He might offend people.

But, at this point in history, \*Israelis\* are certainly a nation, and their right to self-determination already has expression in the form of a state. (There's a big asterisk here because the official position of Israel is that "Israeli" isn't a nationality, that it is the state of the Jewish nation.)  In theory, I don't think this automatically means that this form of expression (a state) needs to be preserved. For example, if this state is inherently predicated on preventing another nation from self-determination, then there would have to be a different solution.  A few ifs in all that, so I think whether one thinks "Israel has a right to exist" depends on where one goes on those.

He was always progressive and always concerned about the environment from as far back as that debate. You didnt like Clinton so you blame Gore?

Populism wins because of the inability of the political class to go down to that niveau of discussion, en contraire, the political class leaves the arena stating they wont discuss on that level, leaving the field to the opponent.

That's an entirely new concept for me to consider.   I haven't had time (yet) to really sit down and explore/consider the argument, so my initial thoughts are incomplete- but, I think there might be some problematic issues in the practical application of the argument.   Firstly, I think that there needs to be an understanding of why violating autonomy is wrong (and to be clear, I do see it was wrong). I'd argue that autonomy is really about a person's potential (whatever that may be for that person). Violating autonomy robs a person of potential. Murder is the easiest example of this: when someone is murdered, they've been completely robbed of ALL potential.  That leads me to my second thought: the argument does not address *when* autonomy begins in a developing person. In my view, this question is really the crux of the abortion debate: when does life/autonomy begin? So it's sort of back to square one. Is autonomy established in the womb? I'll concede, probably not. If autonomy begins after birth, when? Would a mother be morally justified in not breastfeeding their infant because it violated their autonomy? How about in the case of an infant dying of starvation? Would parents be justified in abandoning a 10 year old child for violating their autonomy? By that age, the child could reasonably care for themselves, even if poorly.   I'd be interested in your thoughts.

Even when I ignore the news I'm outside getting first hand experience of the unpredictability and increasingly extreme nature of weather and the effects this is having on plants and animals.  Not a good idea cutting down pristine forest for minerals, shows the problems with exploitative capitalism and not just linked to fossil fuels. Most of what I've read says that EVs are better than internal combustion but there are definitely problems in the mineral supply chain and we need recycling solutions put in place for a decade time when large volumes of batteries will be defunct. I don't think we can simply substitute EV for ICE 1 for 1, we need to reduce our dependence on cars so that personal vehicles are not the standard transport option. But surely EVs have a part to play in transition away from fossil fuel? Even if we do need better environmental protection in mineral extraction

The small number who engaged in terrorist attacks at this time to save persecuted Jews from death by the restrictive immigration policies were so forcefully fought by Jewish authorities in Palestine that it nearly resulted in civil war among the Jews (p. 457).

But they need the money to get him into office, so what they're telling the mega-rich donors is, "All that matters is we win.

And that's because there are a bunch of mentally ill and soulless Trump followers out there who delight in him being a crass and vindictive asshole, but they comfort themselves by claiming he's a genius who is playing 5th dimensional chess.

But it's actually worse in coalition govts. Often a moderate left wing party will win, but won't have enough seats to form a govt. They'll form a coalition with the far right which has won enough seats. Yes, it's counter-intuitive, but that happens. And through the rule, they keep pulling like a tug of war, doing nothing.

Ocean temperatures in the bays upper 250m have cooled to levels not seen since the mid 1980s. Observations and modelling trace the origins of this cooling to anomalous wintertime heat loss in the boundary current that circulates around the southern half of Greenland. Longer time series of ocean temperature, subglacial discharge and glacier variability strongly suggest that ocean-induced melting at the front has continued to influence glacier dynamics after the disintegration of its floating tongue in 2003. We conclude that projections of Jakobshavns future contribution to sea-level rise that are based on glacier geometry are insufficient, and that accounting for external forcing is indispensable.  ____  Related Material(s):  - [Greenland's Jakobshavn Glacier Reacts to Changing Ocean Temperatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHcB5EFDylc) (3:10 duration)

Having said that. Let's be clear about something:  > It can be difficult to attribute an outbreak to a specific cause. But Antarctic ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and are seeing rapid changes. For example, as the ice melts, nearby water becomes less salty. And the bottom water where these notothenioids live is becoming warmer and less salty particularly quickly. Climate change may also affect the life cycle of the parasite, perhaps making it more effective at spreading and transmitting, he concluded.  That climate change causes these tumors is *speculation*. It says so right here.  This paragraph presented is totally out of step with the title. Titles that literally lie are *not* doing us any favors when it comes to winning the climate debate in the US. In fact, it makes that more difficult. If we want climate science as a field to be trusted, we should have a clear, defensible message.  We don't even yet have totally reliable methods for determining if extreme weather events are attributable to global warming (although the opposite is so often asserted in progressive headlines). Honestly, the top submissions to this subreddit are more often than not un-scientific sensationalist headlines. I've never called it out before because it frankly sounds tiring, but this one is egregious.  To be clear, I do think it's plausible that climate change plays a role in these fishy tumors. But in the lack of anything more than speculation at a mechanism for driving this change, and no estimate for how other factors like internal variability may contribute, the belief in that plausibility is really only a personal choice. And the title is knowingly a lie.  At the end of the day, scientific results like this that are only tangentially related to climate change by speculative mechanisms should *not* be drivers of policy decisions. You wouldn't want that to be true for any other policy decision either. I don't necessarily think that that is the intention of the original paper authors, but it *is* the implication of the journalist who wrote the article (as evidenced by some comments here).

Anyway, I wasn't able to watch the old movie based on the novella until years after I first discovered the radio theater version, so I naturally had made my own mental image of how the triffids looked like. So I was needless to say very disappointed by the movie design. The 2009 2-part film did a better job, but the plot was completely bonkers and had one of the dumbest deus ex machina ending I've ever seen.  The radio theatre had an open ended conclusion. The triffids were not 'beaten' but the story had still been told and I was left in an odd state between feeling satisfied and still wanting more.  Way too many modern stories try to explain all their mysteries and leave no loose threads, forgetting that it's the remaining unknowns that leaves fans to obsess over the story for years to come.

The fine is conditional, so if they protest again they would need to pay plus get hit with a second fine, which will be higher due to the repeated character.  Basically, protestors get priced out of being able to protest, unless they do it quietly where nobody takes heed of them.  So nothing will change.

Owing to different model performances against observations and the lack of independence among models, there is now evidence that giving equal weight to each available model projection is suboptimal. This Perspective discusses newly developed tools that facilitate a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of model simulations with observations, process-based emergent constraints that are a promising way to focus evaluation on the observations most relevant to climate projections, and advanced methods for model weighting. These approaches are needed to distil the most credible information on regional climate changes, impacts, and risks for stakeholders and policy-makers.

Here, we report modelling results from hydrate-modulated methane seepage from Vestnesa Ridge, offshore western Svalbard, suggesting that continuous leakage has occurred from the seafloor since the early Pleistocene up until today. Sustained by modelled deep subsurface thermogenic sources of Miocene age, large scale hydrocarbon fluid migration started 6 million years ago and reached the seafloor some 4 million years later. The modelling results indicate that widespread methane seepage offshore western Svalbard commenced in earnest during early Pleistocene, significantly older than late Holocene as previously reported. We propose that the onset of vertical hydrocarbon migration is the response of rapid burial of potential hydrocarbon sources induced by increased sediment deposition following the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciations, 2.7 million years ago. From the modelling results we propose that source rock intervals capable of generating hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon reservoirs buried kilometers deep have continuously fueled the gas hydrate system off western Svalbard for the past 2 million years. It is this hydrocarbon system that primarily controls the thermogenic methane fluxes and seepage variability at the seabed over geological times.

For example, there was recently a law that would have allowed liquor stores to operate refrigerators. That seems like it's good for liquor stores, right? Well, all almost all the liquor stores opposed it because the ones that couldn't afford to upgrade to refrigeration were going to get outcompeted by the big stores that have the surplus cash to dump into that.  Maybe that's an issue for the market to decide, and they should be allowed to compete, or maybe you feel that a lot of businesses that provide jobs to local people and create local wealth should be protected from big box mega corporations that are bad for cities health.    But ballotpedia just says "Supports allowing refrigeration in liquor stores."

For Hillary in 2015, the DNC shut out Sanders and the other nominees.  They didnt get any support, and there was an active campaign to promote her.  But ti backfired, and she lost the election.  The DNC was much more subtle in 2019; Biden was trailing after an early lead, and Sanders was leading the pack, but on Super Tuesday that rep from South Carolina Jim Clyburn whom everyone was waiting with baited breathe to hear his endorsement, he backed Biden.  And he was staunchly establishment, and he brought the black vote with him.  And while most every other congressional member had held off endorsing anyone, after this key endorsement the whole of the Democrat side of congress also suddenly endorsed Biden.  Biden was trailing, he should have lost, but the sudden endorsement from most of congress ended up swaying the votes on that Super Tuesday, as well as most the states on the following days.

The same system we built can instead be used to simulate better ways to build what we need, draw funding from the entertainment industry to fund various climate efforts, monitor changes in agricultural fields, and develop solutions to complex issues. It's only useful currently for engineering tasks, I can't use it to change anyone's minds or pressure government into changing regulations in our favor, especially since we are going to switch to a 501c3. But what it can do is takeover the camera on crossroads and intelligently divert traffic to optimize idling times, learn how to help plants flourish even in chaotic weather, prepare for disasters, and most importantly find green alternative product designs to use in place of the ones we most depend on, including the entire process in making them, as well as phasing out the entire concept of planned obsolescence. Our product has potential in every field of climate change, and we plan to work very closely with as many cleanup organizations as we can get through to.

I was hoping that there was a dissenting theorem or theories that formed the foundation of climate change denialism. A comparable example would be Lamarckian evolution and Darwinian evolution. In their respective time periods, both theories were viewed as having similar credibility, but now in hindsight we know that Lamarckian evolution is incorrect and fails to provide an adequate model. I was approaching climate change from a similar perspective and trying to understand the dissenting scientific consensus, but your response shows that there doesn't seem to be any credible one. Thank you for your time. On an aside, I'm not averse to reading technical literature, so could you point the way towards any introductory papers, reviews, articles, or texts on understanding climate change.   Edit: I have bad grammar.

The left isn't afraid to criticize "their guy" like the right is. He's enabling a genocide and won't call it out, and it's not wrong to point that out. People are actually upset about it, because people are dying. It's not weird for that to be a big thing suddenly. Turns out, people don't like seeing kids get murdered.  The issue isn't the criticism, nor infighting, the issue is the people that will be turned off of voting because it won't feel emotionally fulfilling. People treating voting like it's something to feel proud of rather than a duty. Because of this... there's an actual risk that people just won't vote for Biden.   People need to realize voting doesn't always feel good. It should, but we're stuck in a crap system so the options are "feels bad" and "fascism incarnate" and a vote for neither means the fascist wins. So we need to vote to ensure that we even still have a crap system to reform in the future.

However, copied from the other thread:  >	Mark Jacobson does not deserve to be taken as a credible source of information  >Mark Jacobson is a professor from Stanford who has been advocating for 100% renewable energy for a long time, including a couple  other feasibility studies like this one.  >His most infamous attempt came several years back, and battery storage prices were considered too prohibitive to really consider. So his roadmap paper was a big deal at the time, because that iteration claimed we could cheaply transition to 100% renewables easily and without needing battery storage.  >Some other scientists were skeptical of his conclusions and dug into his model, and found that there were what appeared to be serious errors that dismissed all his results. They published a rebuttal paper explaining this. The crux of the problem was that Jacobson was using completely wrong numbers for hydro capacity in the US, and therefore hydropower was able to basically cover the role that batteries or other storage tech would have been needed for.  >Jacobson response was that he didnt make any errors, instead the other researchers failed to take into account that he was assuming that hydro plants in the US would be retrofit to increase their capacity something like 10x.  >Now, on the surface, its already a little dubious to just assume you can just handwave a 10x increase in power capacity. But even if that worked out, Jacobson didnt list that in his paper, so the model in his paper is wrong. Either he made a mistake in his original calculations and made up the 10x increase as a cover, or he made a mistake in the paper, either way its his own issue.  >The reason Jacobson doesnt deserve credibility is his response to this. Rather than acknowledge he made a mistake somewhere, he decided to sue the other scientists for defamation because they made him look bad and hurt his professional reputation. This was an intentional instance of malicious litigation. He admitted as much in an interview. After the case was thrown out and he was forced to compensate the defendants for their legal fees, because the lawsuit was absurd, he was interviewed about it. Jacobson says he never really expected to win the lawsuit outright. He was hoping for a settlement, which would include a public apology from the other scientists and a retraction of their criticism.  >Which means, Jacobson, when presented with the fact that the paper he published was verifiably wrong, tried to threaten his detractors with a lawsuit he knew he couldnt win to try and bully them into not pointing out his mistakes. Thats why he doesnt deserve credibility. Because hes a man who willfully lie to cover up any errors on his own work.

For one thing, their production generates a massive amount pollution (I read a figure once that an EV must be driven for at least twenty years to be more ecologically efficient that its gas-powered equivalents due to the emissions released during its manufacture, but I am not fully certain of the veracity of this claim). For another, they are too slow to recharge. Owning one essentially requires that a) you own a house to conveniently charge it from and b) that you will never need to regularly drive a distance exceeding its limited range, or else otherwise possess an alternate means of transportation (i.e. a gas powered car... which more than somewhat defeats the point). What percentage of the population is this feasible for? Further, it seems even more absurd to me to continue dumping resources into a technology with such substantial limitations when a better alternative already exists. Hydrogen vehicles circumvent nearly all the prohibitive flaws innate to electric ones. The only barrier to mass adoption is an abject lack of fueling infrastructure... So why aren't we spending our resources on developing this rather than throwing them into a well chasing after the folly that is battery powered vehicles? I cannot make sense of it.  Even worse than inefficient, they may actually do more harm than good.

Trump made is so that everyone gets a standard deduction of around 12.5k. It goes up a little bit each year so I'm not sure where it's at now. The people really struggling won't wind up paying anything on taxes.   It's the middle class that is getting the short end of the stick here. They usually go straight to Turbo tax or some crap tax service they find at a supermarket. They miss out on deductions for their homes and things like that. The gov knows that most of the people won't want to waste the time or effort to hire a real accountant, even if they would come out ahead in the end.  BTW it was Dems that tried to hire all those new IRS agents. The only people the newbie IRS agents would have been able to go after would've been the middle class people without accountants, the "low hanging fruit". Rich people with real accountants would have nothing to fear from these newbies. Biden knew this, and tried to make this his primary source of income for all his dastardly deeds while in office.

A vast majority of the people who volunteer for the military do so because it is their best economic option, not out of a sense of duty.  This has a number of bad consequences for society.  First, there becomes an incentive for the rich and powerful to ensure that there is an underclass desperate enough to risk their life in the military for pay. If everyone is thriving, there wont be enough volunteers to join the military... the powerful will make sure that doesn't happen.  Second, it creates an even bigger disconnect between the people choosing to go to war and the people fighting in the war. If there is no conscription, the rich and powerful don't have to risk anything in a war. Their kids won't be fighting in it, because they are rich enough to not need to join the military. With no conscription, there is no risk that their family will have to actually fight in a war. Therefore, there is less incentive to avoid war than if they had to risk their family in the conflict.  War is horrible, and that horror should be shared with all in the society, not just the poor.

2022-08-09 06:15:11, 0.030473790766450428, reddit_opinion_climate_change.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: When I saw this paper being released the other day, I was wondering whether anybody would bring it up here! This paper is valuable, and the authors are completely correct that more research is required on the problem of climate change as an existential risk. However, it doesn't contradict what I wrote above.   The main argument of this paper are that there has been comparatively little research into (1) low-probability, high-impact climate change scenarios, and (2) 'risk cascades', whereby climate change increases the likelihood of existential threats such as nuclear conflict, which is what /u/Current-Health2183 was referring to.  This is true. But as the name suggests, low-probability high-impact events are low-probability. That does _not_ mean we shouldn't be taking them seriously. It is important to understand the range of risks in order to make sensible decisions. But there is a difference between acknowledging that low-probability high-impact risks are possible and worth taking seriously, and claiming that they are likely or certain, which is what /u/Current-Health2183 (and many other laypeople) are doing.  As the paper explains, quantifying risk cascades is difficult (if at all possible). Again, it is important that we are able to accurately quantify risk if we are to be able to make informed decisions. If research suggests that climate change dramatically increases the risk of nuclear conflict (a definite existential threat) then this is essential to know, and would translate to climate change also becoming an existential threat. But these risks have not been quantified, and you cannot use the absence of evidence to argue that something is true. Stating that "Climate change _will_ lead to... war", as /u/Current-Health2183 wrote (emphasis mine) is not supported by evidence. It may well be true that climate change will increase the probability of conflict, but (1) this has not been quantified, and (2) conflict itself is not an existential threat (again, an event does not have to be an existential threat for it to be catastrophic, but we have to be precise).

It sounds like your wife is trying to keep her job and reading the room and she hasnt paid close enough attention. It also doesnt sound like she is annoyed with you and trying to shut you up because of your beliefs but because it is not safe to openly say or do things where you are. Like wear a keffiyeh or put a Palestine flag in your yard. OP sounds like she is being censored or about to be censored in the privacy of her own home.

Thus, they are not fossil fuels.      Petroleum, natural gas and coal come from biomass, primarily from plankton and decaying marine organisms, and single-celled bacteria that evolved in the Earths oceans about three billion years ago. Over millions of years, layers of sediment built up, along with plankton, algae, and bacteria. Heat and pressure began to rise and the degree of heat and the amount of pressure, along with the type of biomass, determine if the material becomes petroleum or natural gas.      Members of these massive colonies died off and sank to the bottom of the sea and were gradually covered by accumulating sediment. These layers of sediment grew heavier and heavier until the dead bacteria trapped below were cooked by the pressure and temperature into a stew of liquid hydrocarbons.      The term fossil fuel is really a misnomer that caught on and is still being used.      When a company comes up with the idea of making plastics out of algae or other various plant materials, theyre really just replicating the same natural process to manufacture plastic as Mother Nature did, only we can do it more quickly today through industrial processes.

If prices keep going up, and interest rates are still at where they are, by November I'd bet on Trump winning.  Biden needs to focus less on young voters, who according to this poll are the least likely to vote and the least likely to pay attention to politics, and instead shore up the Democratic diverse coalition and independents. Be overtly firm on immigration without fear for what progressives will say. Continue pushing for pro-worker policies, such as the recent tariffs, even if they undercut climate initiatives.

They also talk about sodium batteries as if they have no constraints themselves. That was amusing.   I found something interesting though.

I chose to post this part specifically, because it was the most ridiculous part of the entire thing but in my honest opinion, the entire video is just another attempt at propaganda. First of all, the video is heavily cut and edited together, despite Hagari (the IDF spokesperson) saying that it's "raw footage" - there is no continuous footage at all, they don't actually show him going anywhere not even from the alleged tunnel to the hospital and each time he claims to have found something or has something important to show us, it's a brand new clap that's been edited into the video.  They say a senior Hamas commander lives next door to a school but don't give neither the name of the commander nor the name of the school, the only thing they say is that it's in the vicinity of Rantisi hospital that was recently forced to evacuate. Don't you think that's a lot of important information to leave out, especially as the fight is supposed to be against Hamas and targeting it's leadership? [The tunnel claim was already disproven](https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1724198250754748847?s=46) and it [turned out to be nothing more than an elevator shaft](https://twitter.com/ioan2010link/status/1724169360401428626?s=46) \- you can even Google separate photos and you'll see shafts the exact same as this alleged Hamas "tunnel" and thats why he tried to excuse not going inside in the video when he showed it. The IDF already tried to use a similar excuse with the Qatari hospital just last week, [when they claimed that a water tank in the hospital courtyard was the entrance to a tunnel](https://twitter.com/AJEnglish/status/1721940876811727065). He also shows us the sudden footage of weapons, which may as well have been planted there as there's no way to know. The "list of guardians" that he claims to have on the wall is not a list at all, when he is pointing at the "Hamas names" he is just pointing at days of the week on a regular calendar that has the week written down from Saturday - Friday and there is not a single name there.    In general, he provides no actual or concrete proof that it was an operations base or Hamas base at any point. The fighters may also have simply been there for treatment or the other option is that from the [testimonies of released hostages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX6TE1Inx3E&lc=UgxivS4gROPJmT42o_F4AaABAg), as well as [one of the testimonies published from a girl held hostage at the present](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/hamas-releases-what-is-claimed-to-be-first-footage-of-an-israeli-hostage-israel-hamas-war-2449936-2023-10-17), it's known that Hamas provides medical care for their hostages. They may have taken the people to the hospital for a certain period of time for medical issues and then left or went to the hospital for treatment themselves. There is no conclusive evidence in this video for the things they are alleging and it doesn't justify attacks on hospitals under international law. The only reason they publish this kind of things is because public opinion is starting to turn on them slightly but they need an excuse and justification to keep the war going, as well as the indiscriminate bombing and the targeting of medical care...hence they are constantly going for the "Hamas base" argument, because by painting this whole situation as a "war on terror", they can eventually have the green light to do whatever they want.

There are progressive black voters and conservative black voters, the same way there are progressive white voters and conservative white voters. But conservative white voters vote for the Republicans while conservative black voters vote for the Democrats, so black Democrats as a whole end up being to the right of white Democrats because you're not filtering out all the conservatives.

He just released a video instead of having an event to announce his bid for reelection. It feels like we're going down the same route where the Dems field a weak candidate.   I think Trump is a complete scumbag and a danger to the country, but the dude is reality TV star. He knows exactly how to keep the media talking about him.

Turning 35 in a few months, so I understand the situation probably stings a lot more for you younger folks.  Still, it helps me to remind myself that we are, at least technology-wise, moving in the right direction. Not as fast as we have to, yet, but the movement is gaining momentum every day. This is not something that can be reversed over the course of a human lifespan, but I'm hoping that I'll get to experience us getting to net zero at least before I die. At least then I can go to rest with the hope that future humans can someday experience the world somewhat the way it was when I or my parents were young.  I also suggest keeping up to date with research being done on how to mitigate climate change, or methods or drawing down carbon. Co2 mineralization like Enhanced Rock Weathering is really exciting research for instance. I'd also recommend following Carbonbrief. They report of much of the climate related news and the politics surrounding them, but in a condensed and down-to-earth way. Following Zeke Hausfather on Twitter has also done me a lot of good. I also recommend Cleantechnica. It occasionally has an angry and doomy article or two, but overall that site has done me a lot more good than bad. Just be warned is all I'm saying.

I gave a example how most of these sources are not true, usa has around 10x more reported cases than India according to the links i sent, and then if we compare population the 10x becomes even more , that means even if 90 percent cases dont get reported we still cant be ass bad as western media portrays us. Ok if usa is 250000 per year and india is 30000, and we asume the 30000 is only 10% then we would have 300000 which is not so bad compared to our population which is 73% more. Ok lets assume it's actually 95% then it would be 60000 which is still not that bad because again 73% percent more population and poverty.

And yes I called it filth. And if you don't like that I called it filth, come see me and I'll explain it to you." In the same speech, he called for an end to the separation of church and state in public schools.  Robinson said that heterosexual couples are "superior" to gay couples because the latter cannot conceive a child together. Robinson compared homosexuality to cow manure, maggots, and flies, explaining that the latter all serve a purpose in God's creation; whereas, with homosexuality, Robinson remarked, "If homosexuality is of God, what purpose does it serve? What does it make? What does it create? It creates nothing."  On February 3, 2024, Robinson threatened trans women with arrest over bathroom use and suggested that they "find a corner outside somewhere".

They didn't just wake up and decide to be evil for shits and giggles. We can't grow past things like racism unless we understand why people hold these views, and racists do change, especially when they interact on a personal level with the groups they despise. It often comes back to the culture they were raised in...  ...When I was a teacher, one of my students brazenly called Obama a monkey, to provoke a reaction in me. It was less about racism and more about asserting my status as an outsider whom they did not respect, thus justifying their choice to avoid doing their math assignments. I had another student who said "kill all Muslims" during the pledge of allegiance... right after a mass shooting committed by a couple of Muslims. They'd never met a real life Muslim. These kids weren't evil, and it would be a shame to write them off for being imperfect humans like the rest of us.

The handful of companies producing the majority of emissions only exist because people are buying their products. Individuals are driving the demand for cheap, disposable products. Obviously some consumption is needed, but we consume far more than we need to. We are also happy to stay uninformed of the impacts of our decisions in order to keep plausible deniability (e.g. fast fashion, conflict minerals in electronics, factory farming,).   2. There are absolutely meaningful changes that people can make to reduce their environmental impact, but they aren't popular: having fewer kids, moving to high-density housing, ditching the car, adopting a vegan diet, cutting out airline flights, etc. Instead, articles like to suggest low-effort but low-impact activities like recycling or using LED bulbs or turning down the heat. Enough to pat yourself on the back for looking like you care, but lacking impact.   3. Headlines and articles like this encourage complacency. They are the perfect excuse to do nothing and ignore climate change at an individual level. Too easy to say "It's not our fault. 'They' need to do something about climate change."  We need both individual and policy changes to maximize the fight against climate change, and there is no reason they need to be mutually exclusive.

Separation of Church and state, in its original meaning, meant that the state would not unilaterally impose a particular religion upon its citizens. It never meant that religion should be banished from public life, and christians denied the right to vote their conscience. It doesnt preclude organic religous identity, and if it did, then the problem isnt organic religious identity, its church state separation. As I made very clear, some mild restrictions of freedom to achieve a greater good are common in all political ideologies expect libertarianism and its various strains, and I hope we can agree libertarianism is moral syphilis.

Combining these two effects, about 75% of warming happens after about 30-40 years, which is where your number comes from (Mathematically, the 40 year timescale is the exponential decay scale that comes out of solving the one-box energy balance model ODE, if that means anything to you, and is the ratio of two parameters: the ocean's heat capacity to its deep ocean heat uptake rate). Here is a visualization of these "fast" and "slow" modes of global warming that I made for a talk recently: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhpofSnVoAADZk-?format=jpg&name=medium](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhpofSnVoAADZk-?format=jpg&name=medium) 2. **Natural carbon sinks:** when humans emit fossil CO2, or other greenhouse gases, it throws the carbon cycle out of equilibrium. Pretty quickly, the surface ocean and terrestrial biosphere come back to equilibrium by sucking up some of that CO2 (e.g. by dissolving it in the ocean or by taking it up in soils or plants). Just like for ocean heat uptake, this happens on a number of timescales.  These two processes are thus competing: ocean heat uptake delays some of the warming for later, while CO2 uptake just straight up cancels future warming. It seems to be somewhat of a coincidence that after about 10 years (that /u/DrFolAmour007 is talking about), these two effects pretty much cancel exactly, leading to the fascinating result that: **global warming is directly proportional to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions.**

The christofascists are so narrow minded they cannot conceive of the notion that other non bigoted parents could possibly love their children unconditionally, even in the face of gender and/or orientation diversity. Theyre that weak and fragile that they would rather hurt their own kids mentally/physically, or even be estranged from them completely just because their kids identify a certain way.   Its so revolting how some people think their kids are disposable like, but I find it just as disturbing that these same people who would throw their own kids away are advocating for LGBTQIA+ youth being removed from loving homes just because theyre incapable of seeing anyone elses personal perspective.

They simply differ in their means to achieve such an outcome.  These stances have appeared to have flown well enough with enough American Christian democrats (including myself) that they've decided to adopt it alongside CD, which makes sense, as both would be ideological fringes in the American political system that at least have enough common traits (as well as a common source, though both ended up developing separately) to have worked in tandem with each other.

Examples: (1) Why does your company belong to an anti-environmental lobbying group that routinely fights strong climate policy? (2) Why hasn't your company set long term greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals? (3) Why does your company routinely place its industrial facilities in low income communities and communities of color? (4) Why does your corporate PAC give money to climate deniers?  Believe it or not, companies actually get really nervous when enough members of the public ask these kinds of questions. It's one of the only things that "inspires" them to change. I've done corporate accountability work for a long time and I've seen it happen. You never know if you're going to be the one whose email or phone call or post pushes them into evolving.

I'm not a computer scientist, so take what I'm saying with a popcorn bag's worth of salt...  It seems to me systems like chatgpt are called "AI" out of pragmatism and vernacuar reasons and not some actual rigorous classification intended to communicate meaningful properties about the software. It's my understanding that all AI content is effectively sourced from human-made content that is "rearranged" by the program.   Chatgpt and other systems are also primarily "learning" via brute force. To make an analogy in theme to the Chineese Room: Imagine you need to get an A on a 500-word essay, however you're only allowed to submit it in chineese (assume we don't know anything about it). We, as people, would probably try and get a rudimentary understanding of chineese, then work forward from there. AI programs would approach this task by submitting thousands upon thousands of "essays" that are just different combinations of chineese characters/words (think like the library of babel or infinite monkey theorem). The program sees that a handfull of its submissions got a 1% grade rather than a 0%, so it starts using the 1% submissions as a more important template. The system will then submit several more thousand "essays" until it gets a 2% grade; this will continue ad nauseum until the A grade is reached.

It's such a massive issue that this is a common reaction. Rural Americans only have to hear the word "democrat" and their mind is made up. If the party wants to change this, they've got to start making some inroads in areas that they haven't traditionally found success, and I think that starts with the right type of candidate. Sutton seems excellent, and he's a good model to go off of. It's just that too few Democrats can capture the same energy that he has gathered.

As the financial incentive/consumer demand for renewable energy grows, their investment in those sectors will grow and energy companies will move into that sector (they are essentially "energy" companies, not "oil" companies, so it is in their interest to be involved in various kinds of energy production.  3) Municipal agencies (government) tend to pursue opportunities with a lower return on investment, since they (1) have a much more stable structure to be able to accommodate long periods of return (it is more common for companies in the US to go bankrupt than the government itself) and can accept a much lower rate of return for the risk in their investments, and (2) can afford to make investment decisions for the public good, rather than return on investment (their shareholders are the public, so financial returns are not the primary goal).  Because of this, if an investment is risky, but only offers a 25% return over 5 years, a company may not pursue that, but a municipality might.

Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) offers an alternative negative emissions technology (NET) option. Here we conduct the first inter-model comparison on the role of DACCS in 1.5 and 2C scenarios, under a variety of techno-economic assumptions. Deploying DACCS significantly reduces mitigation costs, and it complements rather than substitutes other NETs. The key factor limiting DACCS deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios average DACCS scale-up rates of 1.5GtCO2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300EJ/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that DACCS can be deployed at scale, and finding it to be subsequently unavailable, leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8C. DACCS should therefore be developed and deployed alongside, rather than instead of, other mitigation options.

The reality is that youre talking about two different funding methods. The money for Ukraine and other countries primarily comes in the form of loans, which are then used on weapons sales that fund our MIC.   Farms, schools, and national parks also have the option to take out low interest loans, but thats not the kind of funding they need. They need federal grants. To get more federal grants, Congress has to pass legislation.   This is a boring distinction, I know, but it really does matter. We truly do need more federal grant money, and it does need to go to these groups, but conflating these two things doesnt help. We need people like you to put pressure on Congress because thats who controls that funding. Complaining about Biden holding Russia at bay isnt going to help our farms and schools.

They use fortran which I believe (could be wrong?) keeps like 64 decimal places. But, when you iterate over hundreds of years, rounding even to the 64th decimal place can lead to different outcomes. Which is why they run models multiple times with the same initial conditions to see how this internal variation of the models code (among other things) leads to different outcomes.

Civic nationalism, which does not have hatred, by its very nature can become hateful nationalism because it creates and strengthens unnecessary divisions among people based on superficial things like food and language and national narratives that are always changing and always pretending to never change. True Christianity as applied to a state is universal and expansionist. Patriotism is a very small dose of nationalism that is a useful tool to unite people, but it is NOT a Truth in any way, it is a malleable thing that serves a higher purpose and should never be an end in and of itself. It is also a tool akin to fire, where if left unchecked / unattended, it will burn down your home. Pride in group belonging is a natural thing, but many sinful things are natural and many things can become sinful through excess. It is our responsibility to be humble, fully selfless and serve our neighbors.   The only nationalism that has ever been and will ever be valid was that of Israel before Christ, and even then it was far more welcoming to foreigners than today's nationalisms.

Third, the opinions of the uneducated masses (under no direction, "no bias") are worthless. Free opinions are worth what they cost. The AGW doomers say this all the time: normal people are stupid, trust the scientists. Technically, they are correct. I'm not asking my grandma's opinion on particle physics or how an HVAC system works. The issue is that they assume that monetary/career incentives, social ostracization, and general corruption don't affect what a scientist will tell you. They also assume all scientific fields are of equal rigor or even equal legitimacy (not the case at all). Certain fields have no true experts because the field itself is illegitimate. If you take into account corrupting influences, an expert's opinion is worth more as a prior. Surveying experts where expertise matters is not always useful, but surveying the general population where expertise matters is always useless.

I'm afraid most of us will face something deeply unpleasant at some point, even those who live in "safe" places.  Some trends are positive. Wind and solar projects are taking over, largely because they have become cheaper than fossil fuels. See [this graph](https://reneweconomy.com.au/solar-and-wind-power-through-energy-crisis-to-chart-record-renewables-growth/) for instance, and the [exponential growth](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-energy-consumption?tab=chart) of solar worldwide. This trend determines where electricity will be coming from in the next decade(s), and it enables a clean electrification of many things.  Similarly, electric vehicles are at the beginning of an S-curve (see [Electric car sales in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicles_in_Europe)), so their growth is also exponential. Smaller electric vehicles have already grown a lot, e.g 300 million e-bikes in China.  That's just for two sectors of the economy. Other sectors are either at the early stages of decarbonisation (e.g steel, shipping) and others are lagging (e.g agriculture). We need to move much faster and I agree with your conclusion.

How this is done varies, depending on the method of distribution: robocalls, social media, email, text message or websites. Right now, research on audio and video manipulation is more difficult because many big tech companies have shut down access to their application programming interfaces, which make it possible for researchers to collect data about social media, and the companies have laid off their trust and safety teams.

The problem with America is the fact that people still think that "socialism is when the government does stuff". Socialism needs the complete upheaval of the capitalist class and reactionaries who support them. It's turning the state, which is a mechanism used primarily for class repression, into one that represses the Borgioues instead of the proletariat. You're  basically saying"we need a little bit of socialism AND capitalism" but that's not how socialism and capitalism work, if you have "a little bit of capitalism" for a "healthy economy" you don't have socialism, it's a binary either you are or you aren't.

Instead we get the ridiculous notion that it was Nancy Pelosi (or Nicki Haley, depending on who you ask) who should have stopped it.  How are we still arguing that he's a strong man who gets things done when he couldn't even stop his own "peaceful" protest from turning into what we all saw on TV?

It might also come from the fact that models might underestimate the some of the albedo impacts (including here dust) and might underestimate how cold the deep ocean was 15 kyr ago and how much of the "warming" that shows in the models in the last 7000 yrs actually went there.  All the above explanations are in no way "good news", since most of the model biases (underestimating albedo changes and ocean warming) would imply that a much larger amount of warming from AGW might still be "in the pipeline".

When these organizations have been severely criticized externally and internally as being extremely biased against Israel? When there are detailed reports of internal problems, hiring practices such as hiring BDS activists to be it's reporters? [B'tselem](https://en.kohelet.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Refuting-the-Israel-Apartheid-analogy-2.pdf) does a similar thing by the way, playing a more activist, dissenting, role than actually caring about human rights abuses.  What boggles my mind is that you all keep using these 3 NGOs, as if what they report isn't critiqued, that it is absolute fact, that their evidence cannot be questioned. When in fact, each one of these are highly criticized by a myriad of groups, [including international lawyers specializing in international law.](https://ngo-monitor.org/pdf/NGOMonitor_ApartheidReport_2021.pdf)  The ***fundamental*** problem that these groups have vis-a-vie "Apartheid" is that something you all miss:  **There is no universally accepted legal definition of apartheid.** Nor is there an such a concept of "Apartheid State" in international Law.  HRW get's some credit in it's Threshold Crossed report for admitting both of these things. Furthermore, the definition that HRW cobbled together does not meet the international standards under the  The Rome Statute (1998), which defines crimes under the jurisdiction of the ICC, treats apartheid as a crime against humanity.   Amnesty International - which is far more egregious - at one point saying the very existence of Israel since 1948 is apartheid, and that the Oslo Accords, despite being agreed to by the PLO, Israel, and witnessed by International community, was a tool of aparatheid.  At least HRW focuses exclusively on Occupied Territories. And that's fair you can make the case, but the problem here is the **occupation**.  International humanitarian law  the legal framework that applies to a belligerent occupation  prohibits discrimination based solely on race, religion, and political opinion without reasonable grounds for the distinction. It does, however, permit the occupying power to apply different laws to its own citizens as opposed to the local population.   B'tselem in it's report talking about Jewish supremacy, can't even define what legitimate expressions of Jewish self-determination and sovereign equality. Nor can it actually prescribe a meaningful solutions to Israel's security. It is self contradictory, simultaneously decrying any annexation attempts of the West Bank,  but demanding that there be one legal framework between the river and the sea.   This is why we don't accept the Apartheid claim. It comes from highly biased NGOs, that improperly use international law, engage in lawfare, and have shoddy work to back their claims. And the **only** reason YOU bring these up is because for some reason you thinkt hat whatever they say must be true.

This is about the stigmatizing of all Palestinian people and those that object to the conditions in Gaza.   This is also about how Republicans have exploited the situation to their political advantage, in efforts to demonize Biden wherever they can and flip the narrative so they can be on the right side of antisemitism for once. Wrongly characterizing all protestors as terrorist sympathizers, and Palestinians as Hamas devotees.   And it's also about a lot more than that. Very little has to do with who is reporting this, it's the underlying context that's important.  Also, plenty of liberals are critical of Netanyahu and the IDFs actions in Gaza, and many would support the accepting of Palestinian refugees as long as conditions are met, like the Biden administration is considering, and also as long as Palestinians have a home to go back to.  I am an American Jew with Ashkenazi heritage,.my ancestors were likely secular zionists.   Yet, I am capable of having a nuanced opinion, and I am as liberal as they come. I can sympathize with the plight of the Jewish people, I can condemn the extreme violent measures of Hamas and Netanyahu's far right regime. I can understand the complex history of this conflict, involving the Palestinian people suffering disproportionately over the course of the last century. But I can also sympathize with the suffering of Jews as they lived through a period of heightened anti semitism and ethnic diaspora.  Either way, there are a fair amount of liberal adults who would support a ceasefire agreement, who object to the conditions in Gaza, and who would support Palestinian refugees status.

In order to fully understand this relationship, it is necessary to constrain the quantity and type of degassed magmatic volatiles, and to determine the depth of their source and the timing of eruption. Here we present direct evidence of abundant CO2 in basaltic rocks from the end-Triassic Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), through investigation of gas exsolution bubbles preserved by melt inclusions. Our results indicate abundance of CO2 and a mantle and/or lower-middle crustal origin for at least part of the degassed carbon. The presence of deep carbon is a key control on the emplacement mode of CAMP magmas, favouring rapid eruption pulses (a few centuries each). Our estimates suggest that the amount of CO2 that each CAMP magmatic pulse injected into the end-Triassic atmosphere is comparable to the amount of anthropogenic emissions projected for the 21st century. Such large volumes of volcanic CO2 likely contributed to end-Triassic global warming and ocean acidification.

I do see a lot of online discussions of regenerative agriculture that tip into a kind of woo-woo alternative medicine space. I've seen some regenerative agriculture conversations connected to a guy named Dr. Zach Bush that I find suspicious. He's an alt med supplement salesman who suggests that all human illness is a result of pesticide residue on our food, specifically glyphosate. He has a "regenerative agriculture" organization set up called Farmers Footprint that frames regenerative agriculture as a anti-pesticide movement rather than one that is oriented towards addressing emissions and climate change. I think Dr. Bush is just trying to sell his supplements, so I would stay skeptical in the regenerative ag space, especially with any sources that cite him as an authority.

Criminals convicted of grievous crimes that make them a danger to society do not deserve a right to participate in its decisions because they have flagrantly demonstrated an oppositional attitude to it, and thus forfeit a right to be considered a member of the polity. Being a member of the polity implies certain responsibilities to the polity, namely respecting the decisions decided by the polity. Flagrantly violating these decisions and then trying to claim a right to be involved in decision making is like a child consistently asking for ice cream for dinner and then demanding a right in decision making over dinner. This does not mean that a prisoner cannot, either as part of or following their eventual reinsertion into civil society, be regranted the right to vote. It does mean, however, that until they rejoin the polity by respecting the common good, they do not deserve a say in the self governance of the body politic.  Similarly, immigrants who have not been legally admitted should not have the right to vote because they are not members of the national community, and thus are not members of the polity.

What is the difference between wanting Hamas to remain in power or choosing policies that keep Hamas in power?   This conflict is not like Afghanistan or the War on terror. There is no where for Hamas to hide and regroup. Destroying a government is entirely possible based on thousands of years of human history.   Your position is no different than allowing the Nazis to remain in power after beating them back into Germany because you didn't want Germans citizens to die in the process of finishing the war.   Peace for the sake of peace isn't a principled position it is appeasement and an acceptance for more war and death.

The war was a defensive war by nature from the beginning.

It wasn't about gaining as much land as possible, it was about maintaining defensible borders. Reading the text of Plan Dalet makes that clear. Those who were expelled- a fraction of the population- were done so justifiably, as they were the ones involved in a war to wipe out the Yishuv.

This might sounds reasonable for an urban setting, but it sounds bad outside the city. It also sounds like it encourages people not to own large stretches of ecologically friendly land, and instead encourages those who would violate the land and put it to use.  In an urban setting, it makes sense, because more people rent, which means titleholders do not own the land as much as they steward it, which in my mind binds them to stronger regulation by the municipal government. It also might make sense, in an rural setting, to treat massive commercial farming similarly.  But nevertheless, my understanding is that taxing a man merely for the land he holds and uses as his own is presumptively robbery, and it is up to the government to justify such taxes, and the only way I can see this is as a charge for services in protection of the land, and so forth. Only if we treat the government as the ultimate the property owner can we justify an intrinsic title for property taxes like we justify an intrinsic title on financial transactions.  In fact, how property taxes are assessed reveals exactly how imaginary this title for tax really is: property tax assessments work by acting like the owner sold the property at its supposed market value, despite the fact the owner did not and usually has no intention to.  And so, property taxes really do do what I speculated they do: treat the sovereign as ultimate landowner, and everyone else are their vassals, with their land their fiefs privileged to them by the king.  >But in practice its a tax. Its not about collective ownership. In fact, it would prevent monopolistic, unproductive land ownership, and hence make home ownership more achievable.  The OP specifically justifies such taxes on the basis of the original common ownership of land.

When Hamas took over, Israel gave them three conditions to drop the blockade:  - Acknowledge Israel's right to exist    - Denounce violence against Israel   - Uphold all standing treaties between Israel and the previous government of Gaza (Fatah)  Seems like a REALLY low bar to not have blockade. Also it never needed to be an 'open air prison', the conditions in Gaza deteriorated rapidly under Hamas' initial years in power. It's amazing how people treat Palestinians like some sub-species that's incapable of acting in the best interests of their people. All this bs about the blockade and open air prison is effectively saying 'Well palestinians just can't help but be violent and are unable to run a functioning society, it's not their fault they are like this, so stop oppressing them!'. It's so insulting to Palestinians. I've met many intelligent Palestinians from Gaza, some of whom are dear friends. They are very open eyed about who is to blame for Gaza's current situation, but they can't speak publicly because it puts their family in danger from Hamas

This is (one of the reasons) why Republicans commit crimes with abandon - they know the Dems won't go after them unless the crime is *utterly egregious*.  And the higher-up the person is in the Republican Party, the more cover they get from the Dems.  This isn't anything that's unique to Merrick Garland - it's a problem with the Democrats.  They care more about appearances than they do about holding criminals accountable.

His party manage to uncover was Republicans casting ballots for dead relatives.  You can be honest, you know that your plan would disenfranchise voters that disagree with you.  You know the only way your party wins is if you rig the system, hell you guys lost by over 7 million popular votes last time.  And Trump didnt just lose by a massive margin, he lost to a candidate that one was excited to vote for.  The American people dont idolize Biden, they dont wear his stupid hats.  They voted for him because they wanted stability and you know the only way you can take that away is to disenfranchise voters under the false pretext of combating fraud.

You would need to prove intent to harm US citizens. Obama wasnt the best president, but I dont think he explicitly wanted to bomb US citizens abroad in Yemen. Yemen is a real messed up country. People arent wearing a Hey Im with the Houthis t-shirt. However, we should be criticizing the US government covering up drone strikes in 2019. They passed a ruling in 2019 where they no longer have to publicly report drone strikes. We cant criticize anymore drone strikes because theyre no longer publicly reported. Now thats fucked.   edit: prove not approve.

Although it is frequently associated with anti-establishment sentiment. The reason it has become a negative word is because Republicans play as fake populists. They cry about coastal elites destroying our country while taking money from the ultra wealthy and cutting their taxes.  Republicans get away with it to some extent because so many high profile creatives are politically liberal. But the reality is that Republicans are the party of the Elites. The fact that every Republican president in my lifetime was either a legacy person from an ultra wealthy family or an actor or both while the Democrat presidents all came from fairly humble beginnings is telling.  Joe Biden is talking about a movement that benefits the bulk of the people in this country and not the ultra wealthy. I don't think it's inaccurate to describe it as populist. And that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

We went into Gaza and pretended we had proof and bombed hospitals and other places that were filled with people and still showed nothing after. A couple tunnels here and there.   I dont care if Hamas is under the hospital or whatever else, you dont bomb it with kids and families inside. What they did doesnt justify what we are doing. If we want to get rid of Hamas all we have to do is offer a real peace deal but we dont want to and never really have for the most part. We created so much mess just to avoid peace its ridiculous and we blame everyone else,  Especially the people who have no control over anything in their lives.

Im generally towards some lighter business regulations, but Im fine with where income taxes are. Im very worried about the rising debt. While I personally have some more socially conservative views, with the exception of the life issues (execution, euthanasia, abortion) I dont think the government should try to really set social policy.  The biggest thing is that I dont start with a negative assumption of the federal government. There are some areas that the federal government can do better in, and Republicans are often too cynical about it.   The Democrats (at least for now) are okay with being a broad coalition, while the Republicans, especially over the last 10 years, have become increasingly dogmatic and partisan, with Trump especially having a complete stranglehold over the party now.  The radical elements in the Democrats can be annoying, and I worry that the party is losing its coalitional nature as more dogmatic progressives/left wingers want to purify it.

There is absolutely no need for "anti-terrorist" activities on civilians, esp by whipping them with sticks and treating them sub-human. That's oppression, blanketed under the facade of anti-terrorist activities for enablement, which I feel the world is now no longer naive enough to accept.  A) I truly think that exactly is the Israelites failure. They believe everything their government and media sells to them, and give up on Palestinian lives so easily. Under no circumstance is the CURRENT mass murder justified, so it is irrelevant to discuss what their reasons are for justifying it.  But for the sake of learning, could you share instances when they've withdrawn and faced increased terror? You could just share the timelines and I'll read up on it. Thanks.   B) I am really glad to know there are peace activists in Israel. Could you share the names or pages of a few, I'd really, really like to follow. I always believe human beings are inherently good and I would love to see messages of peace and unity from Israeli activists. It is impossible for me to digest that one whole nation just hates another whole nation. Humans don't work like that, they're (or should be) more intelligent than that and able to recognize they're all the same.

Wadhams is himself the scientist who did the fieldwork on which the book is based. IIRC he does get political but really only at the last chapter which is aimed at the common "what do we do now that we know this science?" kind of question.  There are a couple others I can't recall off the top of my head but I'll edit this comment to add.  Edit:  Haven't read it but have skimmed, and it looks like a good start for what you're asking: *Our Final Warning: 6 Degrees of Warming* by Mark Lynas. In fact, this question got me thinking, so I'm gonna go find a copy to read.    *Climate Change and the Health of Nations* by Anthony McMichael is also a good historical data analysis of climate changes across the recronstructable past. Not good for current science but good for look at how history has been shaped by even small climate movements, and goes well into *how* we come to chart climate with reconstructions.  Vaclav Smil has a number of rather crunchy books on the historical and present data re: civilizational energy use. Not really climate science, but gives you an idea of how tough a transition to less-polluting sources might be.  The [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/home) is really good. Think it's out of Germany but there's lots to see there.   Additionally, for local/regional to Colorado science, search this sub for published research. Peer-reviewed stuff gets a tag 'Study' and should be findable that way. Reading into the methodologies of some of those studies would give you some more specific ideas of how we come to know what we do re: climate and anticipatable changes to it.  There are two climate scientists who do work mostly re: Colorado/Western US but are well-informed and give good summaries of how we know what we know, IIRC. [Scott Denning](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateCO/comments/qilpjr/csu_climate_scientist_gives_good_summary_of_the/) and Brad Udall are both at CSU (search him, there are a couple posts including a talk with his collected data) and are both good resources I think.

No irrefutable evidence of a base under Al Shifa, boxes (apparently given by IOF) of MEDICAL SUPPLIES, written in English and not Arabic or even fucking Hebrew, inprisonment of children, actively allowing settlers to encroach on the Palestinians land.

Socialism is a very broad word that is often defined in a large variety of ways. Ive always defined it as someone who believes in government/community ownership of large sectors of the economy. Pure socialism is government ownership of all enterprise, but most (non fringe party) socialists in the European and American contexts dont go quite that far, yet they still believe large sectors of the economy should be nationalized. Socialistic is a more general adjective for heavy government coercion in markets, but thats different from being a full socialist ideologically.   To give give a basic answer, shes not a socialist because she, at her core, still believes in the existence of markets and private enterprise. Shes more aligned with the progressive/social democracy wing in terms of her ideology, as she thinks markets and companies should be very strongly regulated and that larger corporations should have certain restrictions. [Her corporate charter idea is undoubtedly](https://www.boston.com/news/policy/2018/08/16/elizabeth-warren-capitalism-bill) very left leaning, in the sense that it sets stricter rules for a companys governance and financial practices, but it still allows them to operate in a market.   It [deserves critique](https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2019/02/05/senator-warrens-accountable-capitalism-bill-has-big-problems/#1b7d902d471b), [and is still an enormous  government intrusion into the market](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/08/elizabeth-warren-accountable-capitalism-act-terrible-idea/) but it largely mirrors the co-determination/social market model many European countries have for large businesses, most notably Germany. Since ownership is still private under her plans she isnt a real socialist, but she is still much farther to the left on the economic-political spectrum. Ive always thought social democrats is a better way for describing people like Warren and Sanders anyways.      The labor theory of value is a mostly academic concept, but Warren isnt a pure socialist so I dont see how its terribly relevant to determining her beliefs at the moment. No different than a question like Do you have a critique of unregulated capitalism in the sense that its a bit of a gotcha question.

For, the God is not a straightforward democrat how gives gifts equality to all, but rather prefers to gives his gifts to all through others. Through Adam to his descendants, through Noah to his descendants, through Abraham to his children, through Moses and to Israel, through David and to Judah, through the Apostles and to the Church, through the martyrs, through the saints, and ultimately everything through Christ, God gives his graces to the many through one or a few.

Personally, I condemn the actions and remarks about the food and water, and wish there were a clearer distinction between the Hamas (who they are at war with), and the Palestinian people.

This is why there's so few people that aren't and actively go out and help people. Because not being greedy and selfish requires effort, being greedy and selfish does not. This is basic human biology.  Capitalism is the giant scape goat that people blame everything on when they don't actually understand what the world is like.  Capitalism didn't exist all throughout history when the rich owned everything and the poor suffered, just like today. Capitalism wasn't a thing throughout the entire 1000 years of Roman rule, but yet it had the same outcome. Because that is the inherent state of humanity.  The problem with this whole, "we need to destroy the system and rebuild it back up!" is that people ignore a VERY IMPORTANT aspect of this: **Humans are not equal, and they will never be equal. People who are not equal will use opportunities to elevate themselves while others sit behind. Thus creating a gap. This gap is fine at first, but slowly builds over time to the point where it gets really bad, like today.**  I don't agree with it, but this is human nature.

They've been doing this since Reagan. It's called the Two Santas strategy.  During a Republican president's term, they spend like absolutely crazy. This bolsters the economy in the short-term and makes it look like they're doing good, and they find as many big flashy bullshit things to do as they can (the Wars on Terror and Drugs, the border wall, etc) to look like they're getting stuff done and being good presidents and keep public support, while driving the national debt up as much as humanly possible.   Then, when their momentum wears off and a Democratic president wins, they can start screaming about the national debt and telling the public to look how high it is and how bad that is and how the Democratic president had better do something about it. The Democratic president lowers the national debt, has conservative spending policies to avoid raising it any higher, and isn't able to do a lot of big stuff due to being forced to focus on lowering the national debt. Clinton left office with a national *surplus,* the only time that's ever happened, and Bush responded by jacking it up to record levels with his war. Obama lowered it back down considerably, not to a surplus but *way* lower than it was under Bush. Trump comes in and breaks Bush's record for highest national debt, and Biden has been doing his darnedest to lower it again. Meanwhile, the Republicans blast those presidents and get everyone to call them useless, lame ducks, failures who get nothing done, all because they're busy being forced by the Republicans to solve the problems that the Republicans themselves intentionally caused.   Why is this called the Two Santas strategy? Well, the first Santa is the Democratic Party - their policies can to some extent be seen as "handouts" or "gifts." They want to give people free/cheap healthcare, education, social services, planned parenthood, social security, things that most people normally do actually want. Republicans don't want to give people any of that, in fact they want to take such things away wherever they exist, so in comparison they look like the Grinch to the Democrats' Santa. So what to do, since becoming actual popular candidates through popular and people-helping policies isn't something they're willing to do?   Well, focus on making themselves look like the real Santa, and the Democrats look like pretenders. With their rampant spending, they simultaneously boost the economy in the short-term, which makes voters think that they're being helped, and also fuck over the economy in the long-term once the Democrat's in office which makes the voters think they're being screwed by the Democrats. They give big handouts and tax cuts and such to the rich and to corporations, which *in the short-term* "trickles down" to everyone (again granting the illusion of prosperity) and further reinforces rich/corporate support for the Republicans over the Democrats. And the Democrats, when they get back in office, are stuck running damage control and not being able to give out their handouts anymore while the Republicans run an effective smear campaign on them and point at how "good" the economy was when the Republican was in office and how much the Republican "got done."    Most people don't know or care to learn enough about this to realize it's how it works, and of those who do, many of them constantly being lied to and misled and "what about"-ed by the Republican party to keep them from figuring out the truth. It's a frighteningly effective strategy that has been central to the party's ability to maintain power and influence for decades, and it seems like there's little the Democratic party can really do about it. The Republican Party has long abandoned any illusions about governing for the people and for the good of the country, choosing instead to shamelessly do the opposite and trick people into believing otherwise. The Democratic Party may not be a whole lot better in terms of its motivations, but it still tries to maintain the illusion of being "for the people" and "for the country" and tries to fix the problems the country faces, and this allows it to stay wrapped around the Republican Party's proverbial finger.

Just a read a few articles where Judge Merchan asked Trump's lawyer, Blanche, whether there was previous case law that showed Trump retweeting or reposting somebody else doesn't constitute violating a gag order and Blanche said there was no such case law examples.  Assuming Judge Merchan decides against Trump, I think he will start with a fine because that is what Alvin Bragg was asking for. I was watching MSNBC this morning, and the panelists, including a few lawyers, agreed that it was smart for Alvin Bragg to ask for a fine first, because Bragg knows Trump can't help himself, and a few thousand dollar fine is nothing to Trump. The lawyers on MSNBC think that Trump will continue his behavior and the fines will keep escalating, until finally jail time is considered for Trump.    While I personally prefer that Judge Merchan just throw Trump in jail, I think Judge Merchan wants to be careful on this, and show the public that he gave Trump one too many chances, before he finally gives the ultimatum to Trump that next it won't be a fine, it will be jail time.

Scientists always make comparisons with preindustrialised age of 1850 to tell us how we messed up.  Even today scientists don't want to be alarmist. Damn, the glaciers in Indo-Pak border were supposed to melt in 1,000 years. But it's all gone in just 30 years. In the rains half of that country goes under water. The permafrost was estimated by our scientific community to survive at least 100 years. The ice sheets are fast disappearing in just three years. And we are told, don't be alarmists, be positive. Why are we, the people, not ready to declare climate emergency. Why are we so sanguine and clutching at the straws of some scientists claiming it's not all that bad.  The root cause of the crisis is modern lifestyle that encompasses profit-oriented corporate philosophy, economic growth, personal ambition, technology, commercial farming, animal husbandry, real estate, modern medicine, aviation, etc. Fossil fuels are only a small part of the problem. Even if we become net zero or carbon neutral tomorrow it doesn't mean climate crisis will be resolved or humans will survive extinction. Why is everyone trying to project net zero as Nirvana.   To depend on technology to save mankind is a serious misconception that all lobbyists are busy peddling. Technology is the root cause of the crisis. It's like asking a rapist to find ways to deal with sexual assault cases.  The only way out is to reverse the development trends, find alternative lifestyle to modern concrete jungle, cars, fashion accessories, everything. We are running out of time. Now when COP meetings take place I just get into depression. Nothing happens at these stupid meetings except for a lot of companies making a lot of money in the jamboree and the promise of growth of greenfield projects.

I was so impressed by Al Gore's documentary and presentations that I became his ardent follower. But in about 10 years I started realising that he is simply lobbying for solar and wind energy companies. He has vested interests. The educated and aware news media cannot get a grasp of the grave threat, and they too talk about how unicorns in green technology are going to make new billionaires. All I have to say is, W.T.F.  The real issue is, we have been brought up in modern lifestyle for the last two centuries. All political, corporate and modern-day religious leaders talk about how to achieve "your goals". No one is ready to say your goals are driving us to the cliff, to our extinction. It's unnerving and unacceptable for us to say go back to subsistence farming, give up modern jobs, our aim to buy the latest fashion accessory, car, etc. No one even wants to propagate frugal living.  Human life today is reflected perfectly in YouTube and IG. Everyone wants to make money and flaunt their "exotic lifestyle." Sane voice on YouTube is few and far between. As a BBC documentary on YouTube says, Gen Z has no hope of resolving the climate crisis. So they don't even have a long term plan. Now let's all say "W.F" to that.

We find that, coherent with increasing air temperature, there is an intensification of the hydrological cycle, evident from increases in humidity, precipitation, river discharge, glacier equilibrium line altitude and land ice wastage. Downward trends continue in sea ice thickness (and extent) and spring snow cover extent and duration, while near-surface permafrost continues to warm. Several of the climate indicators exhibit a significant statistical correlation with air temperature or precipitation, reinforcing the notion that increasing air temperatures and precipitation are drivers of major changes in various components of the Arctic system. To progress beyond a presentation of the Arctic physical climate changes, we find a correspondence between air temperature and biophysical indicators such as tundra biomass and identify numerous biophysical disruptions with cascading effects throughout the trophic levels. These include: increased delivery of organic matter and nutrients to Arctic nearcoastal zones; condensed flowering and pollination plant species periods; timing mismatch between plant flowering and pollinators; increased plant vulnerability to insect disturbance; increased shrub biomass; increased ignition of wildfires; increased growing season CO2 uptake, with counterbalancing increases in shoulder season and winter CO2 emissions; increased carbon cycling, regulated by local hydrology and permafrost thaw; conversion between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; and shifting animal distribution and demographics. The Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its 20th Century state and into an unprecedented state, with implications not only within but beyond the Arctic.

In the present study, we present an analysis of global cropland area change for the first two decades of the twenty-first century derived from satellite data time-series. We estimate that, in 2019, the cropland area was 1,244Mha with a corresponding total annual net primary production (NPP) of 5.5PgCyear1. From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9% and cropland NPP by 25%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5% as a result of intensified agricultural land use. The presented global, high-resolution, cropland map time-series supports monitoring of natural land appropriation at the local, national and international levels.

It's crazy how the nuclear plants still in operation are all built on massively outdated designs that are basically barely controlled time bombs, while any safer designs have been prevented from being fully researched or built. Pressurized systems full of water = steam explosions and hydrogen explosions, and on top of that the system requires constant active cooling. Any disruption to the power supply, and boom. It's beyond stupid. People habitually assume those explosions are nuclear in nature but they're not, it's the steam and hydrogen (and graphite, in Chernobyl) going off and tossing the nuclear material around. If we just stop building these things out of crap that's blatantly flammable and/or explosive most of the danger is eliminated.

Let me give you an example. In 1967, when Israel got control of Gaza and the west bank, they also got control of the Golan heights, and within it 40,000 arabs (mostly Druz). All three territories were offerred Israeli citizenship, but only the arabs of the Golan took it. As a result, they enjoy all the benefits of living in a modern country with free health care. They are fully integrated into Isralei society. The same fate could have been for the arabs Gaza and the west bank. Sadly, every chance they have to be peaceful and advance their interests, they choose violence instead, and people like you justify their behaviors.

The Biden admin just capped the price of many prescription drugs, most notably insulin. That list will continue to grow, too.  >Inflation is proving to have been largely artificial and forced on us by greed corporations.  Not entirely true. Corporations take advantage of inflation to increase their profit margins, but real issues like COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine are obvious contributors. That's why inflation has been felt across the developed world, and it's worth pointing out that it's been much worse in other countries while Biden's been in office. In fact, inflation is now back to normal levels, though we'll still need time to recover from its effects.  >Its just not rhat safe out there anymore. Mass shootibgs are everywhere.  It's not like the left isn't trying to address mass shootings. Gun death rates average way higher in red states. The simple fact is that the national government is legislatively deadlocked and there's a bunch of right-wing nutters on the Court.  >The far right is constantly threatening violence while the far left eggs them on.

I'd be interested to hear what you're referring to.  >Why should we be expected to give a shit about all the idpol bullshit and the interests of tiny percentages of the population when they can't even deliver us a decent life?  There's a number of things to unpack here, but I'll stick with the most important, which is that identity *politics* is overwhelmingly a distraction tool of the right. The Biden admin's signature initiative has been the Inflation Reduction Act. It is injecting huge amounts of money into American manufacturing and industry and addresses a ton of other kitchen table issues. No part of it has anything to do with what anyone would call identity politics.  >As a working-class class man, I've fucking had it why should I remain a liberal? Seriously, why? I'm tired of struggling to survive.  Biden visited a UAW picket line *today.* While that itself is just a gesture, it's in line with the administration's noninterference in the union's choice to strike. Allowing unions to control their side of the negotiation is pro-labor politics.  There's also the Inflation Reduction Act, which I know I already mentioned, but I think it bears repeating. Massive investment in semiconductor manufacturing. Infrastructure funding to rival Roosevelt's New Deal. Reigning in prescription drug prices.  When you step back from the fit that the GOP is throwing over gender expression and teaching the history of slavery, all of these policy accomplishments and efforts are evident. It takes a while for things like major infrastructure projects to spin up, but we're still recovering from the COVID economy as is, to say nothing of the massive GOP corporate tax cuts.  >Liberals don't care about me  >Of losing my health and car insurance  I mean, one side is actively pushing for a greater government role in health insurance and the other is pushing against it. A split congress makes it hard for either to get much on that front.  >How am I supposed to stay liberal when it feels like they're just trying to distract us no different than how the right does with this stupid culture war business?  But I don't think "liberals" are trying to distract you. I think you're only seeing liberals when they engage with the people who are already the loudest in the room, conservatives.

It's not just about land.   Israel's move toward the far right largely came about as the result of efforts toward peace being rejected over and over again. The Palestinians were offered a very good deal in 2000, including over 90% of the West Bank, all of Gaza, and a $30 billion reparations package. Arafat turned it down with no counteroffer and the second intifada followed shortly after. Israelis learned that trying to negotiate is seen as weakness and ultimately leads to more violence. This is not a worldview that many in the West understand.  But even looking at it from the angle of violence begetting more violence, i.e. Gazans "wanting revenge," it's important to recognize that this works both ways. They blew up Israeli buses, shot up bars, and sent suicide bombers. Israelis turned toward the politicians who promise to protect them, because the more left-wing players had thus far failed. Obviously Bibi in particular also failed, and probably made things worse in some ways, but there was a reason people bought into his platform. Before October 7, the last 17 years were much more peaceful than the late 90s/early 2000s in terms of terrorism within Israel.  At this point the view is largely that Palestinians in Gaza can be as radical as they want. But their means to act on that radicalization, including rocket launchers that are STILL being used to indiscriminately fire at civilian areas, will be destroyed.

Even CD would likely remain a fringe ideology, even without Distributism. The only chance that these third parties would get to demonstrate their capabilities is if the Two Party System collapses, which is highly unlikely for a number of reasons.  As for the bit on Catholic Traditionalism, while I definitely acknowledge that Traditionalist Catholics (such as J.R.R. Tolkien) would be more supportive of Distributism due to its more traditional economic approach, Im a little skeptical in calling it a far-right ideology. If we are tying it to Traditionalist Catholicism, its worth noting that its more Reactionary elements, which would be the Integralists, wouldnt likely be Distributists, but would still subscribe to the economics of Corporatism (or even National Syndicalism) due to the aforementioned reasons of centralization. While Traditionalist Catholics are certainly Right-Wing (at least culturally/socially), I would mainly (though not exclusively) reserve Far-Right label the Integralists. Besides, it would be difficult to tie them to Fascism (with the likely exception of Clerical Fascism, at least with the Integralists), as they tend to view Fascism (both Classical & Neo-Fascism) as modernistic ideologies, with the latter having slightly more opposition due to it having neopagan elements. In short, while Distributism is certainly a fringe ideology, as well as being Culturally/Socially Right ideology, Id argue its not an inherently Far-Right ideology.

But they don't, so it's up to us to get people motivated to vote Democrat and keep building our power until we can get what we want.  My rule for voting is simple. 1st choice is progressive Democrats (or any progressive in a ranked choice election). 2nd choice is moderate pro choice Democrats. 3rd choice is any Democrat we can get, because they still help with party control of the House and Senate, even if they don't directly advance our goals any other way.

For example, she publicly filed a divorce and made a public statement that she was no longer associated with the person or had seen them in years, but then her and the person both had various court documents (traffic tickets, applications for various things) listing the same address for several years. Then after being supposedly separated for years, they got back together  while she was married to another person and living with them. Regardless of what it is or isnt, shes clearly lied about something with this arrangement given the multiple of contradictory statements.

Honestly, if Trump were even moderately intelligent, after losing the election in 2020 he could've just given up power, not tries to pull the classified documents shit, talked to some lawyers to shore up his shady business loans or at least to make sure his company was in a friendlier state (e.g. Texas or Florida), and then he could've coasted the rest of his life, content with knowing that he would go in the history books forever.  If he didn't try doing the blatantly illegal coup and classified docs shit, I don't know that there would've been the political will in NY to do that Trump Org case. And sure, he'd have the E Jean Carroll case, but if he shut his trap and let the lawyers handle it, it'd be a manageable amount of money to pay.  Heck, he could even do a lot of the political grift still. Just say you're running for president, suck up a shitload of donations into your PAC, then when 2024 comes along say that you're reconsidering your run because you're worried about your health and want to spend your golden years with your family.

The more methane you add, the less the effect of adding any given amount, so you can't simply multiply the amount you add times the current effect of adding a small amount.  Yes, the methane gets oxidized before you see the full temperature impact, even if you add it all at once.  There are some factors which seem to increase sensitivity as you move farther away from normal.  Methane lives longer the more you have, although this seems to be overemphasized in my opinion because destruction by tropical lightning isn't remotely close to saturated.  The clouds used in climate models are generated by parameterizations generated by observations around current values.   We can increasingly simulate these clouds directly on small scales (not climate model scales).  This seems to indicate that the values used in climate models are wrong in climates much warmer than currently exist.  This seems to indicate that past a certain level of global warmth, you get a sizeable abrupt upward shift in global temperatures associated with the disappearance of temperate marine cloud decks.  This seems to be necessary to explain the warm poles with not greatly warmer tropics during the time of the dinosaurs, which climate models have long had trouble explaining.  The science behind this is still quite open.

And you keep getting down voted because you're completely ignoring other people's points against predominantly going nuclear   Unfortunately it's not the 70s anymore and it still takes upwards of 30 years to get a plant up and running, AND even longer for its energy output to offset the massive amount if carbon it takes to build one. So, we kind gotta deal with the timeframe we have now. I don't think we should completely write-off nuclear, and I definitely dont think we should shut down plants already in operation, but I think if we focus all of our time and energy into building plants instead of fundamentally changing how society operates (less car dependency for example), it's going to take much longer to reach net zero versus implementing wind, solar, etc.  This source shows that renewables won't infact be implemented at their current rate forever (page 26), where it is clearly seen to be following an exponential curve: https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-Long-Term-Strategy.pdf  You may also notice that switching our energy source is not the only strategy listed in the fight against climate change, and there any multiple strategies the don't include "spending all of our time and resources creating nuclear power plants because it's our only hope against climate change."

Palestinian liberation does not call for the destruction of the state of Israel, it simply calls for Palestinians to be treated as human beings, not animals.   Yes, Israeli society is more accepting of queer people. I agree with you on that, it is a fact. I am not denying that queer rights are an issue in many countries in the Middle East. However, that does not change the fact that Israel uses this fact to try and distract from their apartheid regime. Look at the Twitter account of Israel, where they posted a picture of an IDF soldier raising a pride flag among the ruins of Gaza. That is the very definition of pinkwashing, and in doing so they dehumanise Palestinians in order to try and justify their deaths.

In any case, these will be important to interact with the major ESM models right now, at least in the US: Fortran, MPI, NetCDF. Those are all just incidentals though, which anyone can learn. More important is probably to learn about the actual physics of each coupled components, which really just boils down to physics itself. The best advice on a path to take will therefore depend on your previous studies, I think. I'm not sure what a masters in climate change involves.

I mean yeah it's technically true that the US did aid in escalating it because they did what they did, but it's almost on the level of saying that it's the US's fault for resisting the Soviet Union and not preventing it's collapse- if that hadn't happened then there would be no war in Ukraine now either.  NATO expansion is the silliest one. We're supposed to not expand NATO because Russia doesn't like it? The whole point of NATO is to challenge Russia. That goes back to my very first point.  No one is ever going to cease pointing out the utter absurdly of Russia invading a country because they threatened to join a defensive pact to keep them from being invaded by Russia.  Kind of the same logic again for the Crimea. It's the US's fault that Russia invaded because we couldn't stop them from invading. What could we have done? I guess sanctioned them harder, but they couldn't put up the same fight that Ukraine has so military aid on that scale wasn't really an option.  I do agree that Russia calculated that they got away with it, so they figured they could do it in Ukraine too. Look at the timing. If Trump was the president, they probably would have gotten away with it. My guess is that they had the plan in place and figured, "Fuck it." Let's see what happens.  The separatists in the Donbas where sponsored by Russia. In that case the US had no part in it. It's possible that they might have even legitimately sought to break off from Ukraine even without Russian direct involvement. Again, that's an unavoidable effect of the dissolution of the USSR.  The corrupt Ukraine government. Yeah, absolutely Russia would have preferred to have a puppet government in Ukraine rather than seize it by force. Same as the Donbas, but in reverse. The Ukrainians didn't want that.   I guess maybe the US could have fought against it and favored Russia. This is the one thing I suppose we could have actually done differently, but why would we? It's about on the same level of not helping Ukraine and just letting Russia take it over. We could do that too.

Unscrupulous lawyers that will constantly delay, or try to muddy the waters exist, but they usually have better avenues to make motions or introduce evidence which may change the strategy, whereas Trump is just a dumpster fire who sabotages his own defense, because he thinks he's competent enough to conduct his own defense.

2022-12-22 21:20:40, 0.03047255511555901, reddit_opinion_climate_change.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: Colorado residential consumers consumed 135,291 million cubic feet of natural gas in 2021, with  energy value of around 38 TWh.   https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/NG_CONS_SUM_DCU_SCO_A.htm https://buildingclub.info/calculator/convert-natural-gas-cubic-feet-to-kwh-ft3-to-kwh-online  Colorado residential consumers consumed 53.7 TWh of electrical power in 2021.   https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/09/f33/CO_Energy%20Sector%20Risk%20Profile.pdf  Let's assume a residential gas furnace "fleet" average of 80% efficiency, and an average coefficient of performance for heat pumps of 2.4 (the ratio of heat energy provided from a heat pump to the electricity input, at the average temperatures for December and January (22F).   That means if everyone were to switch to electric households now, the 30.4 TWh of heat presently provided by natural gas would have to be replaced by roughly 12.7 TWh of electrical output on the grid for nearly every customer who replaces their furnace with a heat pump.   12.7 TWh is about 24% more electricity than is presently delivered to Colorado residential customers.   Questions:   1. What is the production capacity factor at present in Colorado for electricity? Can it even meet the increased demand for this kind of residential mandate in the next 10 years?   2. Can it meet the demands for electric cars as well on top of the residential mandate?  3. If the gas is simply diverted to electrical production for the grid, what is the cost for the mandate vs benefits from burning the gas to power the all electric homes in the future?  Let's say the costs of installing heat pumps in every home presently served by a gas furnace is $12,000. 70% of all of the 2.4 million homes in Colorado means a cost of $28.3 billion in total. If the $5k furnace is halfway through its life on average, then the difference in costs are only about $9500 per home, so the net is $22.4 billion dollars in cost to go electric.   Is that cost reflected in lower CO2 emissions, ozone, NOx, and particulate overall? What is the cost per kgCO2 saved?   The point of this exercise to to question the wisdom of this mandate compared to other options.   How about mandate that insulation and infiltration standards for new homes meet stringent requirements? Insulation doesn't wear out. It saves CO2 immediately and directly. It's incredibly effective.   I argue that it is more effective than switching to electric for the next couple of decades.   Mandate high energy efficiency standards first. These high standards will crush the demand for electricity generation demand increases over time- the problem evolves its way out of existence. Cutting residential energy for climate control by half means a far lower cost to transition to electricity in the first place, and pays dividends over 50-80 years (much smaller heating and cooling units).   But this makes too much sense, I know.   Imagine a world where you used 1/4th of your present energy. Those energy standards probably would add 10k to the cost of every home. And it will pay for itself within a few to several years through smaller heating equipment needs and lower bills.  Efficiency gains far outpace new energy development over the past 40 years. Efficiency is the place to start,  not well meaning but blind mandates. We need to reduce energy use,  not simply shift residential gas use for power plant gas use  with dubious cost/benefit ratios.

The article itself literally ***INDUSTRIAL,*** not even total emissions. AND the numbers shown don't fucking sum up to 71% 2. The link to study the Guardian claim as their sources is a dead link that no one can access in case someone wanted to vet this "study". Had to dig it up manually hoping to find the correct one, and guess what? The numbers apparently seems to match 70.6% with 100 companies. I said apparently because I still can't find the full list and showed just 20 of them.  \[[actual viable link](https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-production/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1501833772) of an ok summary\]    1. Oh no wait, apparently these are **CUMULATIVE EMISSIONS OF A 30 FUCKING YEARS PERIOD.** Witch by the way was 1985/2015, making it completely fucking useless as a judgement of anything currently going on, unless you're just here to play a sad blame game and pretend it's all their fault.    2. And oh look again, they even did an estimate of 2015 alone and apparently it took them **224 COMPANIES** to reach their 72.1% of global **INDUSTRIAL** emissions. Or you know, over 115% more than in the last 30 years. But I guess using numbers based on reality doesn't sound too good for a shitty narrative. 3. And again, the last available data here is 2015, which means willfully wanting to ignore the last 8 years of huge fundamental progress which at this point is just straight up dishonest, or ignorant to a point where it becomes dangerous for other people, to not consider in the measurements. 4. The Guardians sure loved putting the word "responsible" up there, as if they all did this fucking alone and it was all their unilateral choice to pollute as much as possible. Especially when the fucking study didn't call them responsible for jack shit. They are **PRODUCERS.** Which means they are the one physically doing the actions that emits the GHC in the air, but they aren't responsible, or at least it's incredibly dishonest and disingenuous to pretend they are the only one responsible, or even the one with the most responsibility.    1. If you have a cringe Hammer or any other dumbass car Americans use to waste extra fuel, and you go fill up at Exxon, they aren't the responsible ones, YOU ARE. At the very least you're responsible of all the liters (or gallons) you could have saved by buying a decent car. And if you live in a city and had the choice of using a bike or walking or public transport, then you are responsible for most of that gas being burned in your fucking car.Same exact thing if the government has to turn on Coal plants to power your shitty Crypto mining computer, or if you need methane to power up your heater when you had the choice of getting a heat pump. 5. Literally EVERYWHERE you can see people talking about actual serious and solvable problems about the climate crisis, you will see HORDES of morons using this shitty article and this unrelated and clearly never read study as a crutch to justify themselves and vomit as much whataboutism and doomerism as they possibly can.  And the last point is the most important and what fucking enrages me. It would all be fine if you just wanted to be happy ignorant goblins by reading the horoscope or making sport theories, but this is literally used hundreds of times every single fucking day everywhere as a clutch by climate deniers, doomers that just want to not do anything and people who advocate to do nothing about anything. And you can't call me a liar on this because just today I already seen it 2 times before reading that here, one to talk about how useless it was to do anything at all regarding crypto mining "because muh companies 71%!!1!!11!"  At this point I would legit not be surprised if 40% of the comments posting this crap non stop are just paid oil companies/polluters bots or trolls.

As a black academic he recounts that other professors told him not to publish, and was under police protection due to threats because his research didn't show results that were in line with the left view that blacks were more likely to be shot by the police.

I admittedly blame the right more for this than the left, but that might be my biases talking.   I know plenty of fairly conservative folks and am in some online political discussion spaces with them. They have strong feelings about tax policy and about protecting businesses. They want the government less involved with their day to day lives. They're conservatives.   But they don't think that gay people need to be hidden away in closets. They recognize that a teacher mentioning their spouses regardless of the sexes and genders involved isn't "indoctrination".   They may not be great about locker rooms and trans folks, but they also don't think denying people access to medical care is a good idea.   They aren't for legalizing drugs or defunding the police, but they also don't think drug dealers should be executed and they realize that the prison system isn't great and needs reform.   This puts them *solidly* to the left of the republican party right now while still very much being conservatives. That's the issue.   "I think kids shouldn't be aware that gay people exist" is effectively a position of "gay people shouldn't exist publicly" which is an extreme position and if you say that, yeah, us on the left that think people are people are going to call you on it.   as an example, not an accusation

The [rockets won't stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel) if the iron dome goes down, so defunding it will just increase the civilian death toll in the conflict.

Before continuing to advocate taking down the iron dome though please also think about the incentives Israel will have if we defund the iron dome. If Israel can't shoot rockets out of the sky, they're not going to just shrug, they'll go after *more* ground targets in Gaza. Even if you don't think Hamas uses hospitals and residential areas as launchpads, the area is dense enough that there are no potential launch sites that wouldn't be nearby to such civilian infrastructure.

Unlike the late 20th century when the rise in atmospheric methane was accompanied by an enrichment in the heavier carbon stable isotope (13C) of methane, methane in recent years has become more depleted in ^(13)C. This depletion has been widely interpreted as indicating a primarily biogenic source for the increased methane. Here we show that part of the change may instead be associated with emissions from shale-gas and shale-oil development. Previous studies have not explicitly considered shale gas, even though most of the increase in natural gas production globally over the past decade is from shale gas. The methane in shale gas is somewhat depleted in ^(13)C relative to conventional natural gas. Correcting earlier analyses for this difference, we conclude that shale-gas production in North America over the past decade may have contributed more than half of all of the increased emissions from fossil fuels globally and approximately one-third of the total increased emissions from all sources globally over the past decade.

First, he concerns himself more with USA atrocities because he is American and feels his countrys acts are his concern and responsibility.

Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians. Also, their opposition was the Whig party, which was against the Indian Removal Act and vowed to protect minorities against mob rule. Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery.  (Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it's common knowledge that Republicans are actually the racist ones.)  Then the parties switched when the Democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all Democrats owned slaves, but 100% of slaves were owned by Democrats. Not a single Republican in history owned a slave. As we know, the parties switched again when Republicans repudiated slavery and Democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.  Then the parties switched again when a Democrat assassinated Republican Lincoln.  After the Civil War, the parties switched again during the Reconstruction Era, when Republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the Democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.  The parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people ). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by Democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.  Somewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.  The parties switched again when Republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which Democrats fought fiercely against.  The nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the Democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched Democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.  The parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointed the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.  The parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.  Then parties switched again when the Democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.  The parties switched when a Democrat assassinated MLK.  This brings us to modern times. The parties continue to switch all the time.  The parties switched when Democrats proposed racist policies like affirmative action to limit opportunities for certain racial groups in order to grant privilege to other racial groups.  The parties switched when the Islamic fundamentalist Omar Mateen and several other ISIS mass shooters aligned themselves with Democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  The parties switched again when liberal student groups in schools like UCLA and Berkeley call for segregated housing to make "separate but equal" housing quarters for black students. Actually this is a current ongoing thing, so the parties are right now in the middle of switching on this topic.  Parties always switched currently now that Democrats are rioting and violently protesting democracy.  The parties switched once more when the Democratic Nominee for President, an old white man, said "you're not black" if you don't vote for him, in a moment of clarity of how the Democratic Party sees their largest voter base: as property belonging to them.  So as you can see, because of Party switching, Democrats were always the ones who stood up against racism and wanted peace and unity while Republicans were always the racist and violent ones calling for division and discord.

It's appalling that a guy who led a revolt on Jan 6th is still allowed to (and continues to get) as much support as he does, to the point where he's leading in several swing states.   Can Biden rebound? Sure. Is this over? Not by a long shot. Still a year to go. But these poll numbers do NOT look good. Biden already has the 2nd worst approval ratings as long as they've been polling, only Carter did worse.

Cooperations are like small children, they're gonna continue prodding at the cat (the cat is the employees of that company) because they've never been given reason to believe in consequences. The cats in the United States have been declawed (the declawing is a highly multifaceted issue concerning workplace abuse, financial abuse, social abuse, and the elimination of a sense of brotherhood among citizens) by their children overlords and any swipe of a retaliation just doesn't have the same effect that the intact Japanese cat had when it swiped at the prodding hand.

It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints, this situation is unlikely, so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018, there is a 64% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. Although the challenges laid out by the Paris Agreement are daunting, we indicate 1.5 C remains possible and is attainable with ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors.

My advice to this task  Learn as much as you can about your audience. Know them better than they know themselves.   Segment your audience based on behavior.   Try to find examples of folks who were against climate change but changed their minds. What was it, specifically, that led them down a new path? They may not know but there is typically identity related (who they think they are) hints to what swayed them.   Strategically craft messaging to you audiences.

However, weather when considered globally is now in uncharted territory. Here we show that on the basis of a single day of globally observed temperature and moisture, we detect the fingerprint of externally driven climate change, and conclude that Earth as a whole is warming. Our detection approach invokes statistical learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the relationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and humidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global mean temperature or Earths energy imbalance. Observations are projected onto this relationship to detect climate change. The fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data. Detection is robust even when ignoring the long-term global warming trend. This complements traditional climate change detection, but also opens broader perspectives for the communication of regional weather events, modifying the climate change narrative: while changes in weather locally are emerging over decades, global climate change is now detected instantaneously.

A fallacy is simply something that has any chance of maybe being wrong.   Fallacious reasoning is always an indication of a weak foundation for a position. It doesn't mean the position itself is inherently incorrect, but is an indication of the likelihood of such. This is why it's important to identify what is fallacious reasoning and what is not. Appealing to an authority is not in itself fallacious reasoning. Suggesting it's always a fallacy and there's nothing wrong with it undermines the purpose of identifying and categorizing fallacious reasoning.  "9. The ad verecundiam fallacy concerns appeals to authority or expertise. Fundamentally, the fallacy involves accepting as evidence for a proposition the pronouncement of someone who is taken to be an authority but is not really an authority. This can happen when non-experts parade as experts in fields in which they have no special competencewhen, for example, celebrities endorse commercial products or social movements. Similarly, when there is controversy, and authorities are divided, it is an error to base ones view on the authority of just some of them.

In this study, we analyse the SLTYs in China in peak summer (JulySeptember) for the period of 19732017, during which typhoon landfall intensity (LFI) experienced significantly abrupt strengthening in 1987 and 2003. The period is divided into three sub-periods: period-I (19731987), period-II (19882003), and period-III (20042017). It is found that the increase in LFI is dominated by the enhancement of intensification rate but not intensification duration. Meanwhile, the SLTYs in China have also abruptly increased since 2004, characterized by the count of about 65.9% (72.7%) of SLTYs in China (South China) in period-III. Further analysis shows that the warming subsurface ocean heat content (OHC) over the northern South China Sea (SCS) plays a key role in modulating typhoon's intensification, which subsequently enhances the easterly steering flow leading typhoons to move westward. Low-level water vapour convergence and vorticity are enhanced accompanied by warming northern SCS along the coastal region of southeastern China, resulting rapid typhoon intensification before landfall.About 9.7% of typhoons with landfall in South China experienced a rapid intensification process in 24 hr before landfalls in period-III. However, the per-centage is only 1.6 and 3.1% for period-I and period-II, respectively. The warming land surface over South China plays a minor role in attracting typhoons to landfall in South China, which named as warmward landfall .Overall, the abrupt enhancement of LFI and more SLTYs in China since 2004 are governed by the warming ocean, while the abnormal easterly steering flow and warming land surface over South China leading typhoons to move west-ward play a secondary role.

It's a great read and has some of the stuff you're looking for. There's a chapter dedicated to interrupting a construction site that's pretty enjoyable. My favorite low level activity from the book is just pulling up surveyor stakes wherever they're found.   Beyond that, and solely in the interest of the creative process, there's a sliding scale of escalation that I think would be worth exploring. At the low end, let out the air in tires of high emissions vehicles. Target oil and gas gathering pipelines. These are fairly small and often run dozens of miles through unmonitored rural areas. Gather publicly available pollution information and publish it. I can't speak for all areas, but for example the environmental commissions in Texas have to publish all pollution events from the oil and gas industry. It's just so much, it's almost never gone through and reported on.    At higher disruption levels would be what most of us would think of when we think sabotage; blocking shipments, spiking trees, etc... Pretty much anything that would raise the price of business. The top end is where we get into the things that only the most extreme folks would consider; assassination, large scale destruction like burning down buildings, or trying to manufacture the next Covid.   All that said, there could be some fun in exploring some of the legal options. I'd read something about a group of Gen Z going whole hog to win a city council election if it were done right.

There are some fair discussions to be had about them, but lots of people just say myths about GMO.  Organic is more resource consuming, it's even questionable if the current organic crops can be called organic given how many centuries of human "manual" genetic intervention they had.  It seems like transportation is not always a big factor in emission, [according to this](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/food-footprints?stackMode=relative&facet=none&country=Beef+%28beef+herd%29~Lamb+%26+Mutton~Beef+%28dairy+herd%29~Prawns+%28farmed%29~Cheese~Pig+Meat~Poultry+Meat~Eggs~Rice~Tofu+%28soybeans%29~Milk~Tomatoes~Maize~Wheat+%26+Rye~Peas~Bananas~Potatoes~Nuts&Environmental+impact=Carbon+footprint&Metric=Per+kilogram&By+stage+of+supply+chain=true), and freight transport is actually very efficient, emission wise, so that doesn't add up to as much as I think you are trying to imply when favoring local vs imported. There might be cases where imported can be the best option.

Of course, we could try to consume less plastic at the grocery store, but that requires a lot of time and effort, that frankly, a lot of people dont have in this capitalistic world Where many people work two jobs or long hours. I mean, I would be so much better at the stuff I had a housewife or house husband. Company should produce less thing with plastics, but they have no incentive to do so.

Everyone's policies would bring us around 2.7C of warming, promises(whatever they are worth) about 2.4C. Maybe by 2050 temps will only be increasing by .1C a decade.   Try not to have to much of an American-centric view. Manchin isn't helping but neither are ANY Republicans. China and India are rapidly expanding emissions now while that is largely cancelled out by progress in EU and US. Momentum is shifting in our favor.   We know of ways to mitigate the damage as well. Planting 500 billion trees would cancel out 20 years worth of emissions at today's rate. Renewables are cheap. Electrical devices are getting more efficient. Most large auto manufacturers have commited to ending ICE vehicles. Hyundai recently announced they are no longer researching them in the lead up to ending manufacturing. We're figuring out ways to use hydrogen for things that can't be electrified. We're just plan running out of easy to use oil. The cost of oil will continue to get more and more expensive. Look at the world in 1940 and compare it to today. The differences are insane. That same amount of change (if not more do to technology) is going to happen again.   We've done damage, we're going to do more but it appears to me that in 2100 we'll look back at fossil fuels as embarrassing as our ancestors clean up our mess. I don't look at the system we have right now as worth saving anyway. Let's rebuild how this world works to something more sustainable.  Also, don't get news from doomerism places.

The other object you referenced (volcanos, mammalian bodies, etc) have a physically enclosed space which builds up pressure that causes it to expel as you say the excess mass. This is not the way our atmosphere behaves, so we would need to figure out a way to force this expulsion of mass, which is totally unfeasible due to the amount of mass we would want to remove.

But let's make it a more direct comparison:  Imagine you live in a city of 2 million people and a gang across town shoots up a police station and kills some cops, so the cops respond by bombing several homes, killing your family, and claiming that they had to because the gang is hiding among the population and the only way to fight back is to just mass murder civilians.  Imagine people you don't even know are hiding weapons in tunnels under your neighborhood and the police just bomb every house and hope they collapse the tunnels, would you defend them? If they destroyed your home and killed your family and didn't even give you a chance to evacuate because they don't know if you'll warn the gang members, would you still defend them murdering your innocent family?  And then there's the bombing of shelters and evacuation routes. Imagine they do warn you and your family does pack up and leave on the designated evacuation route, but the route is getting bombed on a daily basis and the police claim they don't know if gang members are evacuating too so they have to! Imagine you survive and get to a shelter at a school or a hospital and then it gets bombed and the police say gang members were probably hiding under the shelters and using you as a shield.   Would you still side with the police for mass murdering civilians that did everything they were told and peacefully abandoned their homes so the police could destroy them and seize their land?  It is trivially easy to put yourself in the shoes of a Palestinian and immediately recognize that what Israel is doing is morally indefensible. No sane, rational person can arrive at any other conclusion.  Especially when you consider that money is fucking genociding Israelis! Hamas' effectiveness is pitiful and Israelis only account for 5% of all deaths in the conflict to date. Claiming that Israel must tolerate genocide of its people in order to respect human rights and not commit war crimes is an absolutely asinine take.

When there is a legitimate military target in a neighborhood, that target may be bombed and it may cause incidental damage to the other surrounding civilian infrastructure. Israel is not targeting civilian infrastructure, they are targeting military targets and civilian infrastructure is being damaged as a knock-on effect.  Instead of accusing Israel of wrongdoing, you should be asking why Hamas stole hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid to build an underground fortress while depriving the people of Gaza of that aid. The aid was given to help the people of Gaza, not so that Hamas could build a fortress.

Grid stability is analyzed in five regions; six isolated states (Texas, California, Florida, New York, Alaska, Hawaii); Texas interconnected with the Midwest, and the contiguous U.S. No blackouts occur, including during summer in California or winter in Texas. No batteries with over 4-h storage are needed. Concatenating 4-h batteries provides long-duration storage. Whereas transitioning more than doubles electricity use, it reduces total end-use energy demand by 57% versus business-as-usual (BAU), contributing to the 63 (4379)% and 86 (7790)% lower annual private and social (private + health + climate) energy costs, respectively, than BAU. Costs per unit energy in California, New York, and Texas are 11%, 21%, and 27% lower, respectively, and in Florida are 1.5% higher, when these states are interconnected regionally rather than islanded. Transitioning may create 4.7 million more permanent jobs than lost and requires only 0.29% and 0.55% of new U.S. land for footprint and spacing, respectively, less than the 1.3% occupied by the fossil industry today. ________________________  Related Material(s):  - [Evaluation of a proposal for reliable low-cost grid power with 100% wind, water, and solar](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722)  - [Stanford prof ordered to pay legal fees after dropping $10 million defamation case against another scientist](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/07/09/stanford-prof-ordered-to-pay-legal-fees-after-dropping-10-million-defamation-case-against-another-scientist/)

Concurrently, emissions of anthropogenic aerosols will decline, due to coemission with GHG, and measures to improve air quality. However, the combined climate effect of GHG and aerosol emissions over the industrial era is poorly constrained. Here we show the climate impacts from removing presentday anthropogenic aerosol emissions and compare them to the impacts from moderate GHGdominated global warming. Removing aerosols induces a global mean surface heating of 0.51.1C, and precipitation increase of 2.04.6%. Extreme weather indices also increase. We find a higher sensitivity of extreme events to aerosol reductions, per degree of surface warming, in particular over the major aerosol emission regions. Under nearterm warming, we find that regional climate change will depend strongly on the balance between aerosol and GHG forcing.

Delaware does not follow other naming patterns because it is named after the first governor of Virginia whose name is associated with the Lenape people of the Delaware Valley. Delaware would be a good example if you were reaching for administrative divisions of countries named after Europeans, like Pennsylvania or Georgia or Louisiana.

There is no extra solar radiation incident on the surface of the planet.  The same solar radiation is striking the earth as before.

It continues to heat up until outgoing radiation increases to the point that it equals incoming radiation (which never changed).  In other words, solar insolation never changes (it can't in this scenario).  The only radiation that changes is the outgoing.  There is no "extra energy incident on the surface of the planet".

I just want to say hello to everybody, he told the hundreds of people crammed into the small sports hall, rattling off a list of local officials helping his 2024 bid in the critical early state.        For most of the next 90 minutes, the Republican frontrunner read dutifully from a script, outlining his vision for a second term, and only occasionally veering off-piste.        After meandering through around a dozen policy items, Mr Trump wrapped up.        This is what we must do, in conclusion, to restore our country to greatness, he said. The great silent majority is rising like never before.  &#x200B;  This is not the bootstrap, grassroots-led Trump campaign of 2016, nor is it the chaotic re-election bid he waged from within the White House in 2020.        The bombastic dynamism remains a hallmark of his stage presence, but Mr Trumps unpredictable verbal detours are no longer the dominating feature of his campaign appearances. His once lengthy rants have been curtailed, replaced by more detail-oriented speeches, albeit with his trademark snipes at political foes.        The change is by design. The 2024 campaign is a sophisticated operation intent on propelling Mr Trump back into the White House for what his inner circle hope will be a revolutionary second term.        The Sunday Telegraph has spoken to key figures within Mr Trumps orbit to lift the lid on how his inner circle hope to sweep him back into power in a years time.        It can be summed up as a three-pronged strategy: obliterating Republican rivals, fiercely preparing for a likely re-match with Joe Biden, and putting in place an administration-in-waiting.   Unlike his insurgent 2016 campaign, run by a ragtag team of associates and family members, his 2024 campaign is in the hands of some of the best Republican minds in the business.        It is led by Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, veteran strategists with decades of experience in getting candidates elected.        Insiders suggest Ms Wiles, in particular, plays a senior role in directing operations. During her career she has worked to help three Republicans win the presidency and is credited with making two longshot candidates Florida governors  most notably Ron DeSantis.  &#x200B;  Based in Mr Trumps home state of Florida, she helped him to an unexpected win in the critical state in 2016, repeating the feat in 2020.        She has the central casting background which appeals to Mr Trump, who has privately commended her celebrity background to friends. Her late father, Pat Summerall, was an American football player and legendary sports broadcaster, though Ms Wiles has never sought the limelight herself.        Whit Ayres, a veteran strategist who worked with her on Mr DeSantiss first run for governor in 2018, says her great strength is her ability to keep her head down, stay out of the news and try to keep the drama to a relative minimum.        He is among numerous Republican strategists to praise her ability to tread the delicate balance of stage-handling an often impulsive candidate not known for obeying orders.        I dont think anyone could manage Donald Trump, but Susie Wiles would come closer than anyone else I know in doing so successfully, said Mr Ayres.        Ben Ginsberg, who has acted as a lawyer for the Republican Party and presidential campaigns, has known both Ms Wiles and Mr LaCivita for years.        They know how to win and run campaigns, and how to keep campaigns organised, he said, noting a contrast to Mr Trumps 2016 and 2020 campaigns.        Mr LaCivita has worked on numerous national campaigns. He once served as political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and is intimately acquainted with the Republican Partys political apparatus.        Other key figures in Mr Trumps inner circle are Jason Miller, a longtime adviser, and Steven Cheung, who heads up communications  among the few 2016 members to return for 2024.        The slimmed-down team has brought an end to the revolving-door of staff that were a hallmark of Mr Trumps 2016 campaign as well as his presidency.  &#x200B;  There are weekly phone calls between core advisers to discuss strategy. The campaigns operation is based in a low-key West Palm office, in contrast to the 2016 base in the gold-plated Trump Tower on Manhattans Fifth Ave, or even the sleek powerbase of his 2020 operation, in the influential suburbs of the US capital.        The hub of the operation, however, is a few miles away in Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trumps private club and main residence, where he holds court among critical Republican players.        Gone, of course, are his incessant Tweets. While he still fumes on social media, his team have interspersed his feed with video recordings of him outlining campaign policies.        Most are scripted by his team, though with his input, recorded from Mar-a-Lago, and then posted to his Truth Social account and fundraising pages.   Mr Trump was the first major candidate to enter the 2024 race, but until recently he kept a low profile on the campaign trail, holding far fewer in-person appearances than his Republican rivals.        Insiders say this was a deliberate effort to preserve resources while the field narrows. Holding large rallies is expensive, and it is a long road to November 5 2024.        But his team has not been idling, focusing instead on a robust, boots-on-the-ground voter turnout operation in the early Republican primary states.     **Read the article here: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2023/11/05/inside-trump-presidential-campaign-2024-election-jail/**

This would include both the effects of decreasing aerosol cooling (short lived in the atmosphere) and the thermal inertia of the climate system. Both of these effects are built into climate models.  &#x200B;  The reason there is a thermal lag is because a lot of the heat trapped on the planet by greenhouse gas emissions is actually getting taken up by the ocean, so the planet is not able to quickly come to equilibrium with the rate at which heat is trapped. Eventually, the atmosphere will warm up enough that the trapped heat comes into balance with the cooling by extra blackbody radiation due to the increased atmospheric temperature.

New high-resolution 3D seismic data reveal abandoned channel systems, slumps, and subglacial landforms inside tunnel valleys.   Migrating channels fed by seasonal surface meltwater erode tunnel valleys within 100s to 1000s of years during deglaciation.   Modelled tunnel valleys form time-transgressively close to the retreating ice sheet margin.   Our results explain the formation of tunnel valleys in most previously glaciated regions.  **Abstract**  The geological record of landforms and sediments produced beneath deglaciating ice sheets offers insights into inaccessible glacial processes. Large subglacial valleys formed by meltwater erosion of sediments (tunnel valleys) are widespread in formerly glaciated regions such as the North Sea. Obtaining a better understanding of these features may help with the parameterisation of basal melt rates and the interplay between basal hydrology and ice dynamics in numerical models of past, present, and future ice-sheet configurations. However, the mechanisms and timescales over which tunnel valleys form remain poorly constrained. Here, we present a series of numerical modelling experiments, informed by new observations from high-resolution 3D seismic data (6.25 m bin size, 4 m vertical resolution), which test different hypotheses of tunnel valley formation and calculate subglacial water routing, seasonal water discharges, and the rates at which tunnel valleys are eroded beneath deglaciating ice sheets. Networks of smaller or abandoned channels, pervasive slump deposits, and subglacial landforms are imaged inside and at the base of larger tunnel valleys, indicating that these tunnel valleys were carved through the action of migrating smaller channels within tens of kilometres of the ice margin and were later widened by ice-contact erosion. Our model results imply that the drainage of extensive surface meltwater to the ice-sheet bed is the dominant mechanism responsible for tunnel valley formation; this process can drive rapid incision of networks of regularly spaced subglacial tunnel valleys beneath the fringes of retreating ice sheets within hundreds to thousands of years during deglaciation. Combined, our observations and modelling results identify how tunnel valleys form beneath deglaciating mid-latitude ice sheets and have implications for how the subglacial hydrological systems of contemporary ice sheets may respond to sustained climate warming.

Its nice to get regular people to do a little part to help out, like stop overbuying/wasting food.  But rather than changing nothing else and just asking people to adjust to a system that doesnt just work on its own, the vast majority of focus and effort should be fighting against the things that got us here in the first place that are still actively making it worse.  You dont fix the world by telling people how to act, people act based on the shape of the environment they exist in.  People are acting in such a way that they are participant in the things that are causing climate change, but they are not in control of it, and they do so because it is enabled, nay, enforced.  Most people on earth have absolutely no control over production, distribution, laws, etc..  They dont have control over what they can choose to do with their time, at least with regards to the things we do that have the largest impact.

There is more at stake in this world besides the climate, and they are deeply connected.  Any time you hear someone saying that its the responsibility of people in society who presently hold absolutely no power whatsoever, rather than the responsibility of those who have all the power, take a second to think about that.

It has been hypothesized that this geologically rapid degassing of volcanic carbon dioxide altered seawater carbonate chemistry, affecting marine ecosystems, geochemical cycles and sedimentation. Here we report on two sites drilled by the International Ocean Discovery Program offshore of southwest Australia that exhibit clear evidence for suppressed pelagic carbonate sedimentation in the form of a stratigraphic interval barren of carbonate minerals, recording ocean acidification during the event. We then use the osmium isotopic composition of bulk sediments to directly link this protracted ~600 kyr shoaling of the marine calcite compensation depth to the onset of volcanic activity. This decrease in marine pH was prolonged by biogeochemical feedbacks in highly productive regions where elevated heterotrophic respiration added carbon dioxide to the water column. A compilation of mid-Cretaceous marine stratigraphic records reveals a contemporaneous decrease of sedimentary carbonate content at continental slope sites globally. Thus, we contend that changes in marine carbonate chemistry are a primary ecological stress and important consequence of rapid emission of carbon dioxide during many large-igneous-province eruptions in the geologic past.

We don't have 40 years to wait for price and efficiency to scale up, and I certainly don't see this technology being able to pull billions of tons a year (because it's not just the 30 BILLION from this year, but the billions from every year previously).   I'm not here to be a bummer, but I am here to be realistic. Unless there is a significant scientific breakthrough in carbon capture technology that sees us scale up to pulling billions of tons a year, I don't see it being a realistic way to help our situation.

I go through bouts of highs and lows pretty often, and it takes a while to stable out. Im working on getting more informed, but I've gained some perspectives on the meantime.  My personal bad habit is/was emotionally internalizing almost everything I read on social media about climate. I suggest to take most of what people comment here with a grain of salt. (even me!) Reddit is not a very good place to learn about this on its own.  I think we humans like binary thinking. We want a straight, true, easy answer to things, good or bad. With climate change, often we resort to either "we're fine!" or "we're fucked!" From what I can tell, the future in terms of climate is still very, very unknown. We can predict all we want, but time only tells what can happen.  For me there's something oddly comforting in that.

That mentality was core to the problem that were facing now, said Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz. Though he had resigned by the time the final blow was dealt to Glass-Steagall in 1999, Gingrich was instrumental in picking it apart. In fact, the New York Times noted in 1998 that, during a failed attempt to repeal Glass-Steagall, Gingrich scurried through the afternoon to line up the necessary votes in favor of repeal.

Here we express them in terms of numbers of people left outside the human climate nichedefined as the historically highly conserved distribution of relative human population density with respect to mean annual temperature. We show that climate change has already put ~9% of people (>600 million) outside this niche. By end-of-century (20802100), current policies leading to around 2.7 C global warming could leave one-third (2239%) of people outside the niche. Reducing global warming from 2.7 to 1.5 C results in a ~5-fold decrease in the population exposed to unprecedented heat (mean annual temperature 29 C). The lifetime emissions of ~3.5 global average citizens today (or ~1.2 average US citizens) expose one future person to unprecedented heat by end-of-century. That person comes from a place where emissions today are around half of the global average. These results highlight the need for more decisive policy action to limit the human costs and inequities of climate change.

If so, nay. For several reasons.  Have you seen Chernobyl? Imagine the scene where Jarred Harris' character is explaining why the reactor exploded with the red and blue labels. In this case, the red is increased CO2 increasing heat, and the blue is the aerosols pumped into the air to counter this. Without reducing our use of fossil fuels, CO2 increases, so we have to increase aerosols to account for the increase in trapped solar radiation by reflecting more before it gets trapped. However, aerosols rain out, and need to be continually replenished to maintain the cooling effect. There are also suggestions that their cooling effect is not uniform, and in fact may be nonexistent in some places, and so whichever nation/state/organisation in control of them would probably face massive political pressure (like, climate wars levels of pressure).  If they ever stop injecting aerosols, the "red labels" are still there. So we get all the global mean warming that we otherwise would have had, in the space of time it takes for the aerosols to rain out. I.e. in less than a decade. This would be pretty catastrophic.  Add to this the fact that aerosol injection counters only the warming effect of CO2 and not other effects such as ocean acidification and air pollution, it's at best a very very short term band aid while we simultaneously undertake massive carbon capture and storage efforts or at least massive decarbonisation, in my opinion.  My main worry is that the powers that be make a leap from climate change denial to geoengineering via SRM without the sensible intermediate steps of developing renewable energy and decarbonisation.

The Arab States and the Husseini clan did choose violence rather than live next to their Jewish neighbors.  When Arab states told Palestinian Arabs to run, they did.  When they were forced out by Israel, typically (but not always) after engaging in violence, they left.  After failing to kill the Jews, multiple times, they continue to do so over and over and over again.

I'm not thinking that they are not incapable of doing so by the way, but I had thought for sure that it was economic corporatists that supported fascism, not distributists. Sure, they both are guild ideologies, but distributism is more decentralized in nature compared to corporatism. Correct me if I'm wrong.  As for the Americans supporting both ideologies together, I'd argue that it is the result of an Anglosphere development, as Christian democracy in the continental European sense never arose in the Anglosphere on its own, mostly because it never needed to. Countries where it did end up rising have historically had stronger anti-clerical movements in those nations, propagating the Christians to get involved into the process of political democracy. In the Anglosphere, there wasn't as significant of an anti-clerical movement to mobilize the devout Christians into a political group to fight against it. With ideologies like the Christian left or Christian right (which are of a different origin compared to CD), I'd argue that their existence wasn't due to anti-clericalism mobilizing the religious, but due to political ideologues (whether conservative or social democratic) mobilizing the religious.  The rise in true Anglo-Christian democracy is more of a recent development, motivated by a desire to oppose the duopolistic left-right ideologues that have tried to capitalize on the religious vote. A hypothesis I have is that when CD did rise in Anglospheric countries like the United States, it latched onto it distributist principles, since they likely hit closer to home, due to distributism being an inherently Anglo-Catholic ideology. It was even an influence on the Tories with their Big Society program under PM David Cameron. It only seemed logical for both to work in tandem with each other, as they both have a common origin (i.e. Catholic social teaching). They both simply developed apart from each other, as distributism remained more of an Anglo-Catholic ideology, while Christian democracy evolved with the continental European/Latin American political system.

Your Bitcoin in your wallet is independent of all other Bitcoin. No one can take it and what someone else does with their Bitcoin has no effect on your Bitcoin. Bitcoin is actually the fix for the current fractional reserve banking ponzi.  Bitcoin is a protocol. It was built to track transaction in a globally distributied ledger that says who, which address, control which bitcoin. Also, anyone can view and audit when ever they want. The Bitcoin block chain is actually audited every 10 minutes by the miners and other nodes participating in the network. On the other hand the federal reserve has never been audited.  Also the Bitcoin issuance is very predictable we know that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin and that every four years the supply of Bitcoin decreases by half.  Using supply and demand  and some other metrics we can easily make predictions about the future. Good luck doing that with the federal reserve and US government. No one knows what Powell will do with rates or new money printing. How much US dollars will be created in 2035, we don't know. We do know how many Bitcoin will be created as we know the average block time and the block reward for that year.   How do we guarantee that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin. There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin because it is a key design feature of the cryptocurrency. This limit is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol and cannot be changed without the consensus of the majority of the network's participants. In order to change the consensus rules all nodes on the network would need to "agree" and make the change. This will never happen though, as why would a node who has a personal commitment and holds Bitcoin themself want to dilute their money or potentially ruin the protocol. The code is all open source which means anyone can make changes to Bitcoin. Many other people have tried to make another Bitcoin but all have failed. Dogecoin actually is a fork of the Bitcoin code.   Bitcoin is a revolutionary way or removing trust from a monetary network. The more people using Bitcoin the more powerful it becomes.

I 100% agree with the part before the **therefore**. Volcanoes at higher latitudes should have a greater effect on the northern hemisphere than the whole globe, and I bet the northern most the volcano the more local the cooling effect and the lesser on global temperatures. The eruption happens above 65N during winter the effect on global temperature is almost 0 (the polar night).  I 100% disagree with the part after the **therefore** for the following reasons:  1. The globe is not warming evenly. [The north hemisphere is warming faster than the south.](https://www.berkeley.edu/news2/2013/04/ITA.jpg). And within the north hemisphere the more north you go, the more it warms. Climate change may be worse for the changes in the temperature gradients from north to south than for global warming.  2. The Arctic sea ice plays a crucial role in the Holocene climate. If there is no ice for the summer heat to consume, it will get very warm very fast. Then the Polar Night comes and temperatures will fall below 0. All that water released by heat and an open Arctic ocean will fall as ungodly snow. If we lose the Arctic sea ice we lose our world.  3. The effects of these injections are temporary, so the best time and place to use them is during summer over the Arctic, when there is maximum insolation. Because it will be day most of the time the cooling effect works 24/7 for the duration of the aerosols.  As an added benefit the very far northern regions are not ads green as the rest of the world and are less inhabited than middle Earth.

This paper looked at many environmental drivers, like fall temperatures, fall precipitation.

We argue that (a) performance metricbased approaches to parameter GSA are actually identifiability analyses, (b) the use of a performance metric to assess sensitivity unavoidably distorts the information provided by the model about relative parameter importance, and (c) it is a serious conceptual flaw to interpret the results of such an analysis as being consistent and accurate indications of the sensitivity of the model response to parameter perturbations. Further, because such approaches depend on availability of system state/output observational data, the analysis they provide is necessarily incomplete. Here we frame the GSA problem from first principles, using trajectories of the partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to controlling factors as the theoretical basis for sensitivity, and construct a global sensitivity matrix from which statistical indices of total period timeaggregate parameter importance, and time series of timevarying parameter importance, can be inferred. We demonstrate this framework using the HBVSASK conceptual hydrologic model applied to the Oldman basin in Canada and show that it disagrees with performance metricbased methods regarding which parameters exert the strongest controls on model behavior. Further, it is highly efficient, requiring less than 1,000 base samples to obtain stable and robust parameter importance assessments for our 10parameter example.  **Plain Language Summary**  When developing and using computerbased models to (a) understand Earth and environmental systems, (b) make predictions, and/or (c) make management or policy decisions, it is very important to know which factors most strongly control the behaviors of the model. Tools to determine this are called sensitivity analysis (SA) methods. This paper shows that the use of model performance metrics to assess sensitivity is based in faulty reasoning. By framing the problem from first principles, a logical approach is developed that provides accurate and costeffective assessments of both timeaggregate and timevarying parameter importance. Because the approach does not require availability of system output data, it enables a comprehensive assessment and can be applied to historical and predictive conditions, as well as to future scenarios.

The rate of organic carbon burial through geologic history is conventionally established by using the mass balance between inorganic and organic carbon, each with distinct carbon isotopic values (13C). This method is complicated by large uncertainties, however, and has not been tested with organic carbon accumulation data. Here we report a bottom-up approach for calculating the rate of organic carbon burial that is independent from mass balance calculations. We use data from 81 globally distributed sites to establish the history of organic carbon burial during the Neogene (roughly 233Ma). Our results show larger spatiotemporal variability of organic carbon burial than previously estimated. Globally, the burial rate is high towards the early Miocene and Pliocene and lowest during the mid-Miocene, with the latter period characterized by the lowest ratio of organic-to-carbonate burial rates. This is in contrast to earlier work that interpreted enriched carbonate 13C values of the mid-Miocene as massive organic carbon burial (that is, the Monterey Hypothesis). Suppressed organic carbon burial during the warm mid-Miocene is probably related to temperature-dependent bacterial degradation of organic matter, suggesting that the organic carbon cycle acted as positive feedback of past global warming.

When I need new glasses I go to the optometrist, and if I need my teeth cleaned I go to the dentist. In the constitution, the two are seperate to maintain the independence of the church because religious institutions are foundational to a moral society, and therefore shouldnt be interfered with by the degenerate governmental forces its supposed to keep in check.   Even if the church is superior, then it just leads to the religious officials taking a more political role than a religious role and it leaves a major gap for proper religious foundations.

Nitrogen taxes would do a lot to help wean us off an inherently unsustainable form of agriculture that destroys soil (releasing tremendous amounts of soil carbon into the atmosphere) and pollutes waterways. Taxing negative externalities would help make sustainable options price competitive to unsustainable options because the true cost to society of goods would be better reflected in their sticker price.

Its not like the DNC forced a progressive majority to vote for Biden in the primaries.   Its worth remembering that Clinton was 80,000 votes short of winning the electoral college. Biden was 44,000 votes shy of not winning the electoral college. With how close elections are, I think the DNC is trying to prioritize candidates that more people are ok with, over candidates that may be better, but not as many people are ok with (especially among centrists/moderate conservatives). With how US elections work, finding the most acceptable candidate is kinda necessary to win, as theres no majority that can agree on a perfect candidate.  For what its worth, Bidens been quite limited in what he can do because democrats had a very weak majority in congress (and now they dont even have that). Im not sure how much more Bernie couldve done had he been elected, since presidential powers that cant be affected by congress or the Supreme Court are very limited.

If you think a child doesn't have the mental capacity to understand WHY they are being spanked good luck putting this issue on the backburner and bringing it up later in a discussion, having their fullest attention and also expecting them to follow the same logic you'd be telling them, and then having them come to a conclusion as to why it is wrong.   Also to respond to what you said, you're assuming this spanking is a complex issue for a child, its not. You do a thing, parent yells and spanks you, after once or twice you'd learn very quick what happens when you repeat that behavior. it is very simple.  Also to add, spanking them doesn't help them understand the issues in its entirety, sure, but the point is to condition them to not do it so they don't hurt themselves. They won't understand everything you tell them anyways at a young age, best to just stop the behavior first and they will begin to understand later as they grow

The message throughout that upbringing is that to be a Christian is to seek to be Christ-like. Christ didn't dominate or oppress others, he served them. He cared for the poor, the sick, the lame, the outcast. He sacrificed for others. We are guided to do the same through a personal relationship with God. It is through Him that we learn our way through the world.   But each path is unique and only our own. Others must find their own way and live it in the world, but never from a place of control of others.

If so, maybe start with the person you think you are most likely to be able to convert and ask them if they have thought about the carbon footprint of their food and have they ever thought about having more veggie meals. If you can convince them to do one veggie meal a week with you at work, you can then talk about it in front of the others and try and get a bit of team feeling and do like a team veggie Wednesday or something where everyone has a veggie meal once a week altogether. The more people you can get to do it, the more peer pressure there is for more people to join in. And then once you have them doing it once a week if the food is good (and particularly if it's cheaper than a meat meal), hopefully they might then decide to do more days per week as well, but changing even one meal a week for several people would still have an impact!

Think of it is this way, if the Democrats and Republicans had different candidates, but Biden and Trump both ran as independents, what do you think the votes would look like?  The Democrats would all vote for their candidate, Biden would hardly get anything, and Trump would fracture the Republican vote. He'd probably take \~15 - 25% of it.
2021-07-15 16:49:20, 0.0228881199367881, reddit_opinion_democrats.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: Hello there.  Well, maybe my flair will discredit my opinion on this, but please hear me out.  I can understand why you think this way (although your reasoning doesn't make much sense to me).  Let's start with teaching Christian values (I am on a broad scale here). I was born, raised and still live in Austria - a predominantely catholic country, which you easily see where ever you go (we often enough still have crosses hanging in our class rooms).   In theory and due to the concordat with the Vatican, we have Religion as a school subject from Primary school up to High School (I was in a High School where I was able to switch to Ethics). We learned the basics of Christian "life" and morals, but it heavily depends on the teacher. For example, in Secondary School we had an older teacher, that taught us about the Bible and other religions on a broad scale - most interesting for me was Buddhism. At home we had a cross and from time to time we went to church - both Grandmas (bless them, both died last year) were devout Catholics stemming from their farm life. Classic steps - baptism, first communion, confirmation.  In the end, I can say that I was raised with Christian values and morals, but, to be frank, I just did not care. My parents were very open to this, they still are Catholic but I am very sceptic about it. I hate the Church (we have to pay Church taxes and we don't know anything about what is happening with the money) and I'll probably leave as soon as I have to pay them (as a student I am exempt). I go to mess from time to time (at least on Christmas) and I somehow believe in God - but still with a lot of scepticism.  Helmut Schmidt once said about his belief: "I believed in God up until the war and what came after (he served in the Wehrmacht). When I heard about the Concentration Camps I said to myself: if God is good, how could he have such things let happen? The death of over six million Jews, Gays, Gypsies etc. From then on, I was sceptic." And I have to agree with him.  &#x200B;  Personally I am very tolerant on this (principle of "live and let live/die"), but I got a big problem in ardent believing in a thing. One thing that High School taught me was to be sceptical. It sounds bad but makes a lot of sense. I don't see my Catholic belief as the crux of my life, rather a small part of it. I want to explain morals not only with my belief, but with philosophy too - having a second leg so to say. And when I look at my friends and acquaintances, I guess Christian belief is only a small part in their lives - and I can't blame them.   Society can work with religion only playing a minor role - there is a good reason why we have the seperation of Church and State today. In my case, Catholic priests, bishops and even the Cardinal were in one part or another in the Christian-Social Party (the big conservative party in interwar Austria). But when 1932 came, a lot of the supported the fascism of Dollfu. So the Catholic Church, official representation of the faith and it's servants, advocated for the fight against Social Democrats - which destroyed Austria and Hitler came in 1938. We even had devout Christians in the Social Democratic party, they called themselves "Religious Socialists" that said "let it be philosophy, let it be religion - as long as we got morals we don't care where they come from!"  Today, no party in Austria gets any support whatsoever by the Church for a good reason. A lot of devout Catholics support the Austrian People's Party (VP) but no priest would even dare to join it.  Let the people have their faith, but not in a dictating way. Society can and will work, it just depends on the influences - and we can reason morals and ethics over other ways than religion, I did it and it works!  I hope I was able to put my standpoint into a good construct of words.  &#x200B;  Good day.

When we (in CO) had that forest fire smoke (from other states to the west and our own *combined*) so thick that it was unhealthy to go outside and it coincided with the worst of the pandemic so going to a gym, etc. wasn't a option as most were closed and the only ones that were open were full of covidiots.  For those who are sedentary and don't mind staying inside their own home for weeks and months on end, I guess it's not so bad, but for me I desperately need exercise and going outdoors for it to help maintain my mental health.  I would wake up in the mornings with the mentality of going mountain biking, then check the air quality and found it was extremely unhealthy, then my brain would scramble for alternatives until I'd come to the dark realization I was a prisoner in my own home.  This is just the beginning of what hell is coming and I'd love to miss it, but I have too many people that need me to stick around and I'll always try to find ways to cope, evolve and adapt the best I can.  I also feel like there's always some alternative to ending it as you never know how things may change in the future for the better or at least be made bearable as circumstances change.  For those who don't have that kind of optimism and/or ability to cope and adapt to bad/horrible circumstances my heart goes out to them and I hope they find help they need to keep trying even when things look very, very bleak.

It feels eerily similar to people saying that the Tories couldn't possibly win after Brexit, or Erdogan couldn't possibly win after the earthquake. All the media pundits were so sure, all the polls were trending in that direction. But then in the last weeks before the election all the polls swung back the other way, and the final votes weren't even close.

This comparison of flying to pros and eating beef for a year is just nonsense. It is a cherry pick without a consideration of a bigger picture.  Fuel production is huge, I agree. But food production is bigger! About 42-50% of land in the US is used for animal agriculture. Here we kill billions (with B!) of animals annually. And we need to feed those animals, to keep them alive, to manage their waste (which we do extreeeemly poorly; basically, they just dump it into the rivers), transport. And thats just a beginning. We also feed them poor quality grains, which makes the meat unhealthy + we feed them a bunch of chemicals and antibiotics which also affects your health as a consumer. Thus, health issues nationwide. Obesity, heart diseases, blood vessels diseases, etc. Thus, high prices for the insurance and health treatments. Thus, those who generally healthy - still have to pay higher prices. And we still havent even started yet. Animal agriculture also means deforestation big time. Because we need more and more space for crops to feed the animals. Less forests - less CO2 is absorbed and transformed into oxygen. Thus, for some countries with already bad air quality - it is one more (more like a dozen more) nail into their coffin.  I touched the waste-management problem, but there is so much more to say about that. Rivers are polluted, lakes are polluted, all with shit and pee from animal farms. Which already, not today but yesterday, made life in some states unbearable because people cant drink their water, it literally increases their chances to get cancer and other extreme health issues big time (google it, Im writing it from my phone and it will take me too much time).  How can you even compare all of this to a flight to Paris? Average person doesnt fly to Paris every weekend. Most people dont fly there every year either. And you say well, if so, go and eat your stake, like, 11 times a weak? That just makes my mind scream. On top of that, an average American eats meat 3 times a day(!!)  And it simply doesnt work that way. If you do one good thing it doesnt mean you can do one bad to counter it. Of course biking and less driving is good. But eating plant based diet + reduce your plastic use are first and most important things which an average person has to look at. In fact, it also will save you money too. Not only on groceries and such, but also on other health-related spendings. Better skin, more energy, no need to visit your dentist and doctor as often, better mood, and much much more.  Your diet is more important than anything. If everybody went plant-based at once, here are a few things which would happen: 1) food for everyone worldwide 2) clean water for everyone worldwide; cleaner rivers and lakes 3) tons of space for just about anything. From clean energy facilities to forests  Actually, I will stop right there. And let you continue the chain of how it could affect the world around you.

It's too spiritual and cynical, it doesn't really evoke societal change or adaptation as arguments, and it implies survivalism. To me this movement is not part of the solution, it just embodies an emotional reaction to climate change.  Maybe we should rebrand it as changeology. On the French Wikipedia article on collapsology, you can already quote several criticisms.  What's worse is that the fossil fuel lobbies can actually use the collapse movement to undermine climate reform.  Maybe it's unpopular in the USA because Americans can label collapse as Kool aid, while Europeans don't really use this term, rather "burying the head in the sand".  I'm really trying to not see collapse as a defeatist movement, and I wish I could.

If he does get voted out, would Benny Gantzs National Unity be the most likely winners?   I must admit I do find the Israeli political system confusing, with a number of small parties having to form coalitions. Of course its not unknown in Europe, e.g. Italy or Germany, but as a Brit with our two-party system (like that of the USA) its unfamiliar.   Some argue that Israels (and Italys & Germanys etc) is a fairer system, with a wider range of political opinions having representation in parliament. Although one advantage of our arguably antiquated first-past-the-post, non-proportional representation set-up here in Britain is that it has managed to keep the far right away from power.

If we talk about a state for the Jews, we don't mean Jews as a religion, but Jews a nation. So lets say we take your situation and there is a nation which doesn't have a state anywhere in the world - let's say some Native Americans who used to live let's say in Utah like 2000 years ago and they are persecuted everywhere else in the world. And then British give a tiny part of Utah to those Native Americans and tell them you can have a state there. And the majority of the de-occupied land goes to US-Americans (with the exception of this tiny state). Sound to me like a no-brainer. I really don't see how this is unfair. Please tell me.  To your statements:  1. There was a census in the Ottoman empire in 1890. On the territories of today's Israel and Palestine there were 43k Jews, 57k Christians and 432k Muslim. Yes, the majority was Muslim. But the number of Jews and Christians is not negligible. And don't forget the Muslim majority is a result of a forceful Islamisation in the past. 2. It depends. If you restore the demographics previous to the occupation it can be just.

Instead, this is about a TURNOUT election - which side can coax or inspire their side to show up and vote the most.  So don't just go to the voting booth by yourself - get your three friends who are in the "oh, voting is such a bother" camp to come along with you.  Anything (legally) to get more people to the polls.

Things I don't like to eat, anything spicy, anything with onions or capsicum/peppers or mushrooms or... I usually just say I don't like food.   All my experiences going to a vegan restaurant with my vegan friends is that it is all too spicey to eat. I even when to an environmental conference and it had the same problem.  I don't know how to cook vegan I can barely cook in general and it stresses me out, I am just one mistake away from having a panic attack in the kitchen every time.

I see that you dont but from your posting history I would definitely recommend seeing a therapist and trying to start some hobbies suggested here like growing plants or volunteering.   Ive had my own experience with spiraling anxiety at different times in my life. Im not on medication now but Ive needed it before just to calm the intrusive thoughts so I could get myself on a different path.   Ive also finally found a therapist I really connect with. Many of them just let me vent without much feedback but I finally found someone to challenge my way of thinking and help me figure out how I actually want to change my thoughts and habits. My only small regret is staying with certain therapists for too long because I didnt want to tell them it wasnt a good fit.  All in all I try to remember whether shit hits the fan in 50 or 100 or 1,000 years, there will be a whole generation of people going through it! Im confident we can find a community of people to help us live or die through it all.

We don't have a plan B economic system ready to go. We're going to need to develop it as we go.  Therefore, what are the ways that we can make progress within a broadly capitalistic economic context while also weakening the grasp capitalism has over our economy? I suggest that we can move collectively to strengthen and promote companies like B-corps, Community Interest Companies and other organizations that follow a triple-bottom-line model (social-environmental-economic). For example we could pursue legislation to tax profits-only companies at higher rates than those with charters that include social and environmental responsibilities. Within that kind of framework pursuing carbon pricing makes all the sense in the world. I'm thinking of it less as an end solution and more as a necessary step on the way towards transforming our economy into one that doesn't privilege primarily the interests of the wealthy but truly takes account of and balances everyone's needs.  Under this view the profit seeking interests of capital aren't the only thing that matters, but rather is one among a number of co-equal societal level goals to be balanced.

He should have created his own party after they rigged the 2016 primary, no doubt about it.   There were multiple times during both primaries where he should have gone on the offensive, such as releasing his own primary data from Iowa for example. He would likely be president if he had realized how much he actually control he actually already had, and been willing to use it to play hard ball.  He is just now starting to attack the Dems for not doing their job (or his social media team is anyway), but I'm not sure he will ever come around.

I think Jews know most of the countries of the world dont want them to be happy or have peace, which is why they will never let go of Israel. And I dont think they should.

Hamas is an organization whose official purpose is the eradication of all Jews from at least Israel and ideally the Middle East as a whole, and its run by people who havent lived in Palestine for quite some time and funded largely by Iran. The current Israeli administration also basically egged this on though, as Netanyahu and his cohort have been looking for an excuse to invade Palestine for decades at this point, and have been trying to provoke Hamas for nearly as long. The leaders of both sides want to complete eradicate the others, and most of the people are pretty much just civilians who want nothing to do with this conflict (though I imagine the violence is just turning more Palestinians into anti-Israel extremists). If Im honest, I think the allies of both shouldve forced them under threat of loss of aid to come to a 2 state solution decades ago, but at this point theres really no winning. I usually condemn both sidesism but honestly, the leaders and string pullers of both sides have been wanting this to happen for years. I really dont know what can be done from the outside to fix this shit, if anything

It would be hard to get a job in climate science proper without an advanced degree in the topic, but there are probably jobs where companies leverage climate science outputs for their own analyses.  There are starts ups trying to apply these methods to improve weather forecasts and analysts at insurance companies / investment funds who are applying these methods to climate projections to try and quantify things like future economic damage. There are probably software engineer / data science jobs in the government science labs, but my impression is that these also require some kind of advanced degree or many years of experience.

I think you are right that in the international community all civilians should be treated with the same moral worth, tho I also think its fair for a government to prioritise its own population over noncitizens and I believe that there is very obvious difference between the deaths caused by Hamas and Israel  2. No I dont think thats at all fair, Hamas is a islamic terrorist group wich wants a glob caliphate and is so antisemitism they would fit in with the most evil of Nazi commanders. While Netanyahu is quite right wing I dont think you can find him saying anything that would Mach the stated goals of Hamas. 3. While I think that extremism can be more easily nurtured in harsh times I think you wrong about basic human nature I think the history of this conflict shows how willing people are to hold on to past grievances and prejudice plus even if Palestine got a state I bet they would still want all of Israeli territory too.  3. I dont know what you mean by integrating Palestinians that would presume that Isreal was playing or would need to at some point where going to annex Gaza (not saying they wont in future but doesnt you statement imply they should why integrate someone that you dont plan to take into your country). Tho if you just mean they just failed to stop extremism flourish then yes they did but I dont think you can blame them for that considering its not like the situation is there fault to start with or that the groups in Palestine and other Arab countries where very helpful with there actions. 2. I think your right I dont believe that anyone has a right of land because of god (tho I accept it a pretty ok line for people to uses a rallying call as the actual reason are normal to long to include in a song) 1. I disagree violence can beget more violence tho soo can non violence. In ww2 the nazis where removed from power and Germany is now a democratic country tho there where hiccups along the way Im sure at the time you could make the same arguments that as the Russians shelled Berlin that this radicalised, even more people but that doesnt mean that a ceasefire would help it would probably just allow the Nazis to move there armys in the south to relieve the siege of Berlin and to rebuild there defensive weapons. If you let a group of people do something and a cry for peace as soon as you counter attack then you will be left in a situation where you are under constant attack and are unable to counter attack. A ceasefire would only allow for Hamas to stay in power (as most ceasefire end up leading to the conflict ending) wich would lead to more attacks on Israel and would stop any chance of peace in the region.

In other words, theyre perfectly OK with an authoritarian flouting the rule of law and Constitution, so long as their team wins and they can hurt the other team. Theyre the mirror image of MAGA but cant see it.   Its super disheartening for me personally to see the number of people on the left and right who have absolutely no respect for, or commitment to our Constitution, our rule of law, our institutions, our civil and political order, etc. and would trash it all in an instant so they could get what they want politically and win, so to speak.

I would not be surprised at all if there was a strong conservative tilt to people who love to work hard.  People who are raised to have a strong work ethic are usually raised to value self-reliance. This tends to make them gravitate toward a political philosophy that (supposedly) rewards hard work and discourages reliance on the government.  I'm a liberal, but I have a ton of anecdotal evidence from my friends and acquaintences that the right attracts the kind of person who will work two jobs, not because they desperately need to, but because they feel like it is the moral thing to do.

I keep telling myself that people like this woman (Gomez) are often emotionally disturbed & easily duped by GOP propaganda, but just the same its concerning because sometimes these people put their insanity into action and harm us - I dont think I need to provide examples of the many anti-gay hate crimes that have occurred lately.  One thing we need to be aware of is how attracted the right-wing has become to fear & intimidation. If Donald Trump wins, dont think they wont use people like this woman or those rappers as enforcers someday who are going to harm our LGBTQ community, because theyd love to if they could get away with it.

However holding with no immediate trial or due process... this is backwards for a democracy...  Especially holding children.  This must be changed... IL citizens should demand Netanyahu and those responsible be held accountable.  He needs to be held accountable for Hamas support too.  Prisoner abuse can be rampant in any system and needs to be rooted out. Purported 36 claims of sexual abuse of purported 800k prisoners in/out is far lower that US (which has thousands times that of actual rape in prison and jails).  However, this should never occur and is abhorrent.   If the red cross was seeing these folks and didn't help them... much like we are seeing them not help the IL hostages. Something is wrong with the red cross.  This is disappointing bc this is the one group that I think most people felt they could donate to without question.

It was clear towards the end of his term that he regretted many of those decisions when they proved to be loyal to the country over him. He won't make that mistake again.   I'm sure our jaws will be on the ground for every cabinet pick in a 2nd Trump term. And as for getting his cabinet picks confirmed, if Trump wins in 2024, that's probably a sign that the GOP also did pretty well down-ballot.   On the flipside, I think Biden could win but not get the same level of down-ballot wins. There were definitely some GOP defectors in 2020 and we could easily see that again. Nothing Trump has done the past few years would lure those GOP voters back. But they'll probably still vote red down-ballot.

Media definitely cried wolf with Trump which made it that when they were telling the truth people didn't believe.

They don't actually care about antisemitism, and for proof of that see their embrace of other politicians like MTG and Trump who have said blatantly antisemitic tropes over and over again.  What they actually care about is enforcing the pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian foreign policy orthodoxy, and anyone who dares to criticize Israel is immediately labeled as "antisemitic."

Maybe you count yourself among them. Its no recipe for electoral success to alienate those voters either.  The point is that Biden is electorally wedged. Is there a reasonable position that can keep his coalition together, such as supporting Israels defense and territorial integrity while opposing the excesses of Netanyahus genocidal rhetoric and the IDFs callous disregard for human life? I would have thought so, but evidently he doesnt seem interested in finding it.

But I still blame Trump for that, because he encouraged it. And I think that's perfectly reasonable.  Likewise, Biden isn't *directly* coming down on students. But he sets the tone. He isn't, for example, *threatening* police forces that go too far (as many of them have). He isn't supporting anything the student are doing. He is saying that "order must prevail".  As I said, what Biden is doing regarding student protests is far less horrible than what Trump did in 2020, which is why people who support the campus protests should vote for Biden over Trump.  But it's dishonest to claim Biden has nothing to do with it. He is the lesser of two evils, but still an evil as far as I'm concerned. We're not grading on a curve here.  And I think more Biden supporters should accept that. As I said, your vote isn't a moral endorsement -- it is a tool to get what you want. Biden is easier to deal with than Trump, so it is a good use of that tool to vote for Biden.  But *nobody* should be solely relying on Biden to take care of them or do good things in the world, because he's a scumbag US President. US Presidents are all horrible people who do horrible things (because if they didn't, somebody else would be President). And Biden is no exception.  And that's fine! Vote for the less horrible person, then get back to trying to bully him and the rest of the powerful into submission.

I dont choose my music by the players politics, but Im unlikely to like something that preaches hate or impoverishing the workers to enrich the rich (which is how I would define conservativisms real agenda). So I skip all Nuges other crap (though if anyone wants to recommend another great guitar jam, Ill check it out). And obvi I skip Kid Rock entirely, cause he just sucks.   But heres the thing: none of the individual songs you mentioned are at all political. I guess you could claim Proud Mary, with its message of a happy sharing community, is basically socialist. But how about Fortunate Son, which clearly and specifically rages against greedy rich people who refuse to pay their fair share of taxes while mongering wars that they send workers off to die in? Donald Trump is apparently too stupid to understand that song, but I refuse to believe you are. Give it a good hard listen and then come back and tell us which side youre on.  But the bottom line is that even songwriters with a reputation as progressives rarely make explicit political statements. Thats why conservatives love to quote Dylan: they can take a song about how young people are going to sweep away the corrupt culture and rebuild it, and they can interpret it to mean greedy billionaires are going to eliminate progressive taxation and repress the Black vote. Anyone whose not an idiot knows thats bullshit, but actual Harvard Law graduates pretend its legitimate.   Your friends might legit think John Fogarty is a progressive, and he is. But very few of even his songs explicitly express it. Let alone typical 60s rocker freaks who were all about taking drugs and being outrageous. Thats not really liberal in any sense that still applies.  But heres another homework assignment: look up Billy Braggs The World Turned Upside Down and see what you think.

This needs to change to "The nature of free market economics ensures that we cannot prevent catastrophic climate change, so we need to transform our societies in preparation for it."  This would force political transformation in a way that "act now or it will be too late" cannot.

I am trying to join a local CCL chapter but I have a few concerns. * There is no local chapter, just an "at-large" group for my state that is based far away from me. * The leader of this group is conservative and I am not really willing to work side by side with people who support such awful politicians. * I don't personally think nonpartisan is appropriate for a topic like climate change. It makes no sense to me when Republicans in the USA overwhelming are horrible regarding climate policy and considering ecology.  Would anyone be willing to address my concerns or convince me that I am wrong to have these concerns? Should I look into stating a local chapter? Is there a different organization that also does political campaigning/is partisan that might be a better fit?

I'm just copy/pasting from my textbook here:  "...electricity produced by nuclear power has a low net energy yield because large amounts of energy are needed for each step in the nuclear power fuel cycle: to extract and process uranium ore, convert it into nuclear fuel, build and operate nuclear power plants, safely store the resulting highly radioactive wastes for thousands of years, dismantle each highly radioactive plant after its useful life (typically 4060 years), and safely store its radioactive parts for thousands of years." (Miller & Spoolman, Living in the Environment, 17ed, p372).   "The most common reactors, called light-water reactors ... produce 85% of the worlds nuclear-generated electricity (100% in the United States). Just in the process of generating electricity, LWRs are highly inefficient, losing about 75% of the high- quality energy available in their nuclear fuel as waste heat to the environment. Before that point, 9% of the energy content of the fuel has already been lost as heat when the uranium fuel is mined, upgraded, and trans- ported to the plant. At least another 8% is lost in deal- ing with the radioactive wastes produced by a plant, bringing the net energy loss to about 92%. If we add the enormous amount of energy needed to dismantle a plant at the end of its life and store its highly radio- active materials for thousands of years, some scientists estimate that using nuclear power will eventually require more energy than it will ever produce." (Miller & Spoolman, Living in the Environment, 17ed, p386).  My textbook is from 2010, so if there is any information which I'm misguided on please let me know! I'm not trying to poo-poo moving away from coal and oil, and I'm aware that solar and wind have large upfront carbon costs.

And I agree, the problem with compounding rounding errors with repeated time steps is a very serious one,  potentially fatal. Careful programming tries to minimize the problem by confirming at each step that known constants (e.g. total energy, total momentum, total angular momentum) in fact remain constant, and correcting for errors at each step.  But, getting back to the original question, as long as the model converts an input integer to a floating point value for all calculations, it obviously doesn't matter how it is input.

The price of these concessions from the International Monetary Fund will be the renunciation of private property and adherence to a program of vaccination against Covid-19 and Covid-21 promoted by Bill Gates with the collaboration of the main pharmaceutical groups. Beyond the enormous economic interests that motivate the promoters of the Great Reset, the imposition of the vaccination will be accompanied by the requirement of a health passport and a digital ID, with the consequent contact tracing of the population of the entire world. Those who do not accept these measures will be confined in detention camps or placed under house arrest, and all their assets will be confiscated."  [Weird stuff](https://pastebin.com/3MSMW9y2)

[Heatland Institute](https://www.desmogblog.com/heartland-institute)  > The Heartland Institute has received at least $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998 but no longer discloses its funding sources. The Union of Concerned Scientists found (PDF) that Nearly 40% of the total funds that the Heartland Institute has received from ExxonMobil since 1998 were specifically designated for climate change projects.  You'll find many "think tanks" (propaganda groups really) that are dedicated to misleading the public about climate change. They spread many stories, which are not even consistent with each other.  The Heartland Institute also used to work for tobacco companies, to spread the idea that scientists were not really sure about the connection between smoking and lung cancer.  Climate science connects a lot of things, and scientists love to cross validate data and ideas. For temperatures, they use several series of ground measurements, satellite measurements, and ocean temperatures as well (the oceans have stored most of the energy from the additional greenhouse effect). They can also observe in real time the spectrum of light that is emitted by the surface of the Earth and captured by the atmosphere, directly proving and quantifying the greenhouse effect. We also see the consequences of increased temperatures, like glaciers melting, increased moisture in the air and heavier rains (on average), stronger winds, species moving to new habitats and changes in ocean currents. Every discipline keeps the others in check, and there is zero doubt about the general ideas of climate change.  Looking forward to answering more of your questions!

Deneen is much more of a communitarian localist, focused on decentralization and building up small communities, like Dreher in the Benedict Option. Whereas Vermeule wants to capture the central state apparatus and Tradistae seeks to revolutionize and reorient the whole system. They're all united by wanting Catholicism to play a greater societal role but disagree a fair bit beyond that.     Deneen has a ton of important insights about the weaknesses of liberalism, even if I think there's some good to be salvaged from that system. His writings greatly influenced the way I see politics. In addition, Ahmari is good when talking about the importance of tradition. Been meaning to read his newest book.     The more outwardly integralist thinkers I often disagree with, although I appreciate and agree with the need for government to serve the common good. I find their vision too authoritarian, unrealistic, and neglectful of America's pluralistic traditions.

They are one of the best examples of aerosolcloud interaction experiments. However, manually finding ship tracks from satellite data on a large scale is prohibitively costly while a large number of samples are required to improve our understanding. Here we train a deep neural network to automate finding ship tracks. The neural network model generalizes well as it not only finds ship tracks labeled by human experts but also detects those that are occasionally missed by humans. It finds more ship tracks than all previous studies combined and produces a map of ship track distributions off the California coast that matches well with known shipping traffic. Our technique will enable studying aerosol effects on low clouds using ship tracks on a large scale, which will potentially narrow the uncertainty of the aerosolcloud interactions.

I read that dense information pamphlet over and over. Miss one, double the next pill, and for our own sake we'll wait a few days. Miss two, we wait til the week after starting the next pack.  Despite the medical literature included with every pack, she always tried to insist I was being too much. Neither of us wanted kids, her whole family, older and younger sister, mother, aunt, etc, got wrecked by teenage pregnancy, yet she was still wanting to play fast and loose. It wasn't until she was like 25 that she finally stopped pushing me for it after missing a pill or two, and sometimes three, and that was an absolute no-go for me.  This doesn't even include the weight limit for emergency contraceptive, which she'd float for "secondary protection", neither of us knew about that, and she was initially close to the weight where it starts losing effectiveness, and gained beyond that in later years. To her dismay, I didn't trust it anyway and wrapped.   Birth control is 99% effective with *ideal* use, taking it every day, at the exact same time every day. Realistic use is closer to 91%, taking into account missed days.

Excess nuclear power is used to split sea water into the oxygen and hydrogen components through electrolysis. Then air compressors reduce the atmosphere down to carbon dioxide/monoxide and everything is recombined to make synthetic hydrocarbons. A single aircraft carrier could produce over 90,000 gallons of aviation grade diesel/kerosine per day.  Seems like a win-win. Its a closed or net neutral cycle since we are removing CO2 from the atmosphere to make fuel. Plus, we wouldnt have to change our technology just yet.

One thing that's always been overlooked for reasons I just don't understand is: white roofs. Seriously, just having the roofs of some buildings turned white cools down temperatures. In some cases it even changes a LOT. The Greeks and South Italians did that for thousands of years already in their villages but now they sorta stopped too just to join the boring dark roof custom.  It's the Albedo effect, the white color reflect sunlight much more significantly both cooling that specific building and reducing the temperature around the area. Then of course just one won't do much, but imagine even just a block of white roofs what it could change. And then imagine a region of white roofs.   Ice glaciers are melting away causing tons of damages, but they were also our main Albedo guys, now that they aren't gone either something else replace them or we're gonna have to endure even more heat and suffering.

The point being, we can hardly afford NOT to do, and yet those costs/benefits would be largely hidden, just like coal is "cheap", because its *real* cost isn't factored into the equation.   If governments were *serious* about it, we'd do WWII-style command economy reforms and stick with them for 10-ish years, which would increase debt and deficit but make that transition less painful for regular folks (depending on how that was done, of course).

If you vote third party, you are effectively voting for Trump. Our two-party systems sucks, but it is not going to be fixed by the next election. This is where we are, and we are out of time.

If theres ever a way to support the reasonable people, even though theyre not fond of Israel, without getting them killed, we should try to do that.   At least we can pray for them to come on top over the haters.   Also, just in case: If there are any decent Iranians here who work as social media people because thats how you could make a living, but you know all the hatred is foolish: Seriously, I wish you well. Lets hope for a day when all decent people can come out of hiding and be kind to each other.

If you voted for Trump the first time,? Theres no logic to it and now we see he cheated so it makes sense but if you voted him the second time youre a racist amongst other things. At this point in the game it just looks like self hatred, delusion or basing your life off Fox News. Ive seen all and none is a good excuse. If youre racist at least claim that shit. Quit trying to hide under religion while youre at it. Im no longer a subscriber but all this crazy hateful shit isnt the vibe or the way we were taught.

I would love to see this and would be willing to make radical changes in my own lifestyle for the future of my children, but not sure how to prompt those with a very significant financial interest to give up their short term (on a planetary scale at least) economic benefits for long term social/health/environmental gains.  It seems like this is something that would need to be prompted by government and the current administration is going in the opposite direction with a lead foot on the accelerator. I'm sure private industry could make a big impact on their own, but to scale up to what needs to happen more people need to push on their governments to change policy direction.

The land was called judea. The history of the kingdoms of judea and israel all started nearly 3,000 years ago. At between year 600 BCE and 500 BCE, judea and israel got invaded by the Babylonians, than persia, and than by the romans. The kingdoms were always Jewish, they belonged to the jews, that is where jews used to live. At least between year 200 AC to 300 AC, the romans decided to change the land's name to "syria falastina" in order to erase Jewish history, why did they did this? To claim the land, that's why, after the Muslim invasion of syria falastina at year 700 AC, the muslim empire took over the land from the last owner before the muslim occupation of syria falastina (I don't know if the last owner of the land before the muslim was the romans or not). The muslim empire expelled all the jews of the land and built the al aqsa. See? The palestinians were never the owners of the land. It got occupied from the Jewish. There was never a "palestinians" until 700 AC. Jesus was born to a Jewish mother so he was jewish. And we tried sharing the land with a 2 state solution, one Jewish one arab, the arab rejected and started a war. (People who say "im not reading all that" are lazy)

The truth really does matter, especially given that so many other people -- bad actors -- are warping or denying other aspects of the truth. Political and economic truths are just as important as scientific ones. They all constrain what is possible.  I am interested in real choices, not political posturing. The human race is facing the most difficult challenge in its history, and we need to face up to the reality.  The actual answer to your question (why are people downvoting me even though they aren't clear what they disagree with) is that they do not like the political implications of acknowledging that I am right. Neither the left nor the right wants to accept that "it is already too late". The right won't accept it because it means the end of economic business as usual forever. It means they can't keep claiming the pie can be grown, so can't justify the rich getting any richer. But the right aren't here -- the left is here, and they won't accept the message because it means the end of any hope of "climate justice".   What we need is to end "pre-collapse politics". We need a politics of collapse.

However, analysts have cautioned that it can come with increased indirect emissions from electricity and battery production that are not commonly regulated by transport policies. We combine integrated energy modeling and life cycle assessment to compare optimal policy scenarios that price emissions at the tailpipe only, versus both tailpipe and indirect emissions. Surprisingly, scenarios that also price indirect emissions exhibit higher, rather than reduced, sales of electric vehicles, while yielding lower cumulative tailpipe and indirect emissions. Expected technological change ensures that emissions from electricity and battery production are more than offset by reduced emissions of gasoline production. Given continued decarbonization of electricity supply, results show that a largescale adoption of electric vehicles is able to reduce CO2 emissions through more channels than previously expected. Further, carbon pricing of stationary sources will also favor electric vehicles.

People need to get something through their heads:  If a presidential candidate actively assists a nation commit genocide and voters refuse to give their support to this candidate as a result, it is ALWAYS the failure of the candidate.   Threatening to withhold ones vote to effect policy change and then following through with that threat is absolutely a legitimate tactic for voters. The American electorate has constantly been told to hold their nose, vote Blue and pick the lesser of two evils. This line of thinking has been used as a cudgel against the American voter for as long as Ive been alive. Every election has been the most important election of our lifetime. This has now gotten us to the point where the lesser of two evils is murdering tens of thousands of innocent civilians. Thats a dark reality.   IMO, if voters had shown Dems over the past 20-30 years that they have policy red lines that will see their votes withheld regardless of the positions of the Republican candidate we would be at a place where Dems would actually adopt platforms that are popular with their base instead of holding wildly unpopular positions (like arming and supporting the ongoing Palestinian genocide) that they then browbeat voters into accepting because they only have two choices. People are fed up with having to accept the well, at least we wont slaughter as many women and children as they would ghoulish line of thinking. Fuck that. If Biden and the Dems want to support this monstrous Israeli campaign and it results in their loss in November, it is absolutely their fault. To blame voters for refusing to support a candidate waging genocide is the antithesis of democracy.

To my knowledge, the Church hasn't taken a specific position on using fossil fuels, but a more general view of taking care of the planet, hence the Pope advocating for fighting climate change. American Catholics are a very diverse group, and contain some very liberal views, as well as some very conservative ones, with a large number of American Catholics being far to the right of the Catholic church, and more to the right of basically any other Catholics. American Catholics are actually split about 50/50 across the two parties, in contrast to the other Christian Americans who align far more with Republicans. American Catholics are really not that representative of Catholics overall, I would say. There's about 1.4 billion Catholics around the world, about 61 million of which reside in the US. The pope is the head of the Church and determines what direction the Church takes, but not everyone follows him equally.   Biden, Pelosi, and Amy Coney Barrett are all Catholics and have very different views, ACB is in an extremist sect of Catholics and better represents the image Americans have of Catholics, but is really a vocal minority. Unfortunately, the vocal minority has an outsized influence. Having been raised Catholic, including going to a Catholic school, the values I was taught aligned with the current Pope and Biden & Pelosi, with the more conservative Catholics being foreign to me. I was even taught in Catholic school that you didn't have to be Catholic to get into heaven, but had to be good to others.    I suppose to answer your question, some follow the Pope, some are more influenced by other conservative Christian movements that are occurring in the US, and should probably consider themselves to be evangelical instead of Catholic.

It was the Emperor that forced the peace treaty through.  Japanese fatalities on island defenses were usually in the vicinity of 95-99%. The record of capitulation and war prisoners was on Okinawa with 10 % capitulating.  The firebombings of Japan was far more deadly and destructive than the atomic bombs combined, and Japan still wanted to fight. They had a military zeal like no other.  If we look at the greater picture, the geopolitical one. The atomic bombs were just as much a warning to the USSR as it was forcing Japan to capitulate, they could have continued with the firebombings killing 100 of thousands extra civilians.

You gave me a burden of proof to show that Haley doesnt always mean what she says, and Ive met that burden of proof. The onus is on politicians to be clear and unambiguous with their policy proposals. Voters shouldnt have to trust politicians, they can and should expect politicians to be explicit and honest and Haley has demonstrated that she is neither. If you campaign on one thing because its popular and will get you elected, but you actually want to do something very unpopular and you keep that a secret from most voters then you arent honest and you arent trustworthy. If shes not trustworthy on abortion then how is she trustworthy on this? And why do you think the burden should be on voters and not on politicians?  Youre welcome to believe her, but you admit you dont trust her. So why should we pretend like shes being candid and forthright when she admits shes not? Your problem is with the candidate, not with me. Its not my fault that she has credibility issues and a history of being deceptive and dishonest about major issues. Thats her fault. Also, the equivocating between dinner plans and the careers of thousands of people and the quality of government we can expect is just deeply troubling. It makes me not take you seriously at all and makes me want to dig in even deeper on my lack of trust for Haley and the GOP. Were not choosing between pizza and tacos for dinner, and its frankly insulting that youd make that comparison.

Being lower than the peak death rate doesn't affect what the death rate currently is, which is why I compared it to a bad flu season and mentioned the 3x mortality rate over a bad flu season.  4x more people are dying every day than die from car crashes.  400 deaths per day is not a trivial amount.  Peak was around 3k/day, so we're at around 85% reduction, not 99%. If you look at the case numbers directly you can make an argument that we're only at like 5% of the peak, but those numbers are drastically lowered due to at-home testing.  Comparing hospitalizations we're only at around 80% lower than peak - a 5x reduction vs a 100x reduction, a pretty big difference.    As for long covid, you totally ignored my point about the vaccine only reducing it by 15-50%.  It gives very high reductions in mortality, but not nearly as high for long covid.  Additionally, it's less effective as a preventative measure vs. the newer variants.  If you don't have the bivalent booster, your vaccine is doing nearly nothing to prevent infection against XBB1.5.    You're wrong about it only affecting people with various other ailments.  There are higher risks associated with having a variety of health conditions of course, but ultimately the risk rates are still pretty high.  [A 70+ year old has only a 1.7x higher chance of developing long covid vs. an 18-29 year old](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01909-w/tables/2).  That's compared to something like cancer where you're looking at 6-10x or heart disease which is even higher.  Also, you mention stuff like high blood pressure and diabetes.  1 in 10 adults has diabetes.  1 in 2 has high blood pressure.  Half the population being at risk of long covid isn't a trivial amount.  Anecdotes don't say anything about the prevalence of covid.  I gave an anecdote to describe how I understand that total isolation isn't viable, not to try to say something about the functionality of preventative measures.  Yes, people who mask all the time and get their up to date boosters CAN get covid.  Yes, people who don't do any of that CAN avoid getting covid.  Some people who play the lottery win millions.  Finally - that's a false dichotomy of "pretend covid is gone" vs "lock yourself in your room".  There are lots of simple things we can do that cause minor inconvenience.  Wearing a mask to the grocery store is low effort for high impact.  As for kids, death rates are low, but long term effects are not.  Long covid in children is common - [25% of children with covid get long covid](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13495-5).  I understand the desire to pretend it's all over and not a risk - especially because you're right that it's here to stay.  That's not a "we can just return to how things were before" though.  Something has fundamentally changed in the world and our behavior needs to adapt.

The IRA only provides incentives in this category but maybe it's enough to have retailers push more for electrification.  I should have kept it more generic - but methane is one of the worse - it's more of a heating risk then CO2.  And specifically methane stoves are very bad for indoor air quality which I forget to mention. (Added to message above - thank you!).  Methane Gas is also called "Natural" gas - which is just as good for us "natural" arsenic.   I was not aware that some gas ranges are actually compatible with either Propane or Methane/"Natural" gas.   Gas stoves are actually the most dangerous for indoor air quality and the most likely for people to have an emotional attachment to them that can thwart electrification (me summarizing [Vox](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/5/7/21247602/gas-stove-cooking-indoor-air-pollution-health-risks) article also see [https://www.cookingelectric.org/homes.html](https://www.cookingelectric.org/homes.html)).   That's a scary point I hadn't realized if you lose power you can't use active ventilation so you are getting even worse air quality from your stove.

Yeah you are totally correct that more energy needed than being produced is bullshit. Maybe better would be that the energy equivalent of what was required to produce it, compared to the energy output is not as high as compared to fossil fuel energy.      And to your comment of 2013 being old sources, I totally agree, but I found different sources from 2018 which more or less seem to agree to the previous findings (there were even more judging by a quick look at the abstracts, but who got the time to read all of them)     Zhou, Z., & Carbajales-Dale, M. (2018). Assessing the photovoltaic  technology landscape: efficiency and energy return on investment  (EROI).*Energy & Environmental Science*,*11*(3), 603-608     this paper looks only at PV technology (specifically searched for it because PV is my concern)    Fig 3 gives a representation of different PV technology and the EROI factor. On the left with the high balance of system cost scenario, again the relative low EROI values are represented like in other studies.  Here is a website from a german professor who lists the EROI for different PV technology, and the values don't differ too significantly   [https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php](https://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php)  Trainer, T. (2018). Estimating the EROI of whole systems for 100%  renewable electricity supply capable of dealing with intermittency.*Energy policy*,*119*, 648-653   Also very interesting, but not specifically concerned with PV. But the conclusion (which is restricted to Australia of course) basically says that 100% renewable can't function with our current demand.  Hall, C. A., Lambert, J. G., & Balogh, S. B. (2014). EROI of different fuels and the implications for society.*Energy policy*,*64*, 141-152   Also last but not least, this paper again is older but their discussion at least from 6.4, renewable energy sources and 7 policy implications resonate too well with my concern that maybe technology will not be our salvation this time.  I mean, in Europe the planned solution was to buy emission certificates through the Emission Trading System (ETS). While in principle not a bad idea, a lot of critics are saying that as long as this is not a world wide policy, it doesn't improve anything. As long as there is a world market for fossil fuel, as soon as one nation tries to reduce their usage of fossil fuel, the demand decreases which leads to a lower price which makes it more attractive for other nations.  I mean, this can't be an excuse to say ok, why even bother to change because somebody else is going to pollute anyway? But still, I think a point is being made there. Because the goal should be to reduce emissions and even if america and germany e.g. reduce their emissions, it doesn't really matter if world wide the net emissions doesn't decrease. And considering that even scientists seem to have some concerns about a 100% switch to renewables, we shouldn't..rush it? Because this could lead to (unnecessary?) economic damage? Or even more important, talk about the other side of the equation which is our demand and life style? And even darker and more prohibited to talk about, the amount of people with even more growth expected in the future, which would lead to even more energy demand etc.  I don't know, with all this said, imagine this on top of the meme with "change my mind" at the bottom, because it's getting a little depressing tbh.

Mussolini referenced the Roman empire as the time that Italy was great and Hitler referenced pre-WW1 Germany.     But both played into the exact same sentiments you're proclaiming here.

Go throw your sabots into a machine, luddite.  People like you would have been same ones screaming about how tractors killed all the farming jobs.  Societies and economies evolve and change, mature economies move to services and knowledge workers, stop whining about how video killed the radio star.  Inequality has nothing to do with loss of manufacturing jobs and everything to do with Republicans cutting tax rates on upper incomes, replacing progressive with utterly regressive economic policies, and constant attacks on unions, all of which were largely the drivers behind the creation of the post WW2 middle class.  The _sector_ of those jobs had nothing to do with it.  If our service industries unionized like the manufacturing one did our society would be vastly better, but it sure isn't Democrats doing everything they can to villify and block them.  And it was _Democrats_ who implemented the IRA that has brought a green manufacturing base and jobs back to the US and is actually looking forward, not looking back and pining for the good old days where we could all die from black lung working the coal mines, not starting useless trade wars with the entire globe that cost our economy hundreds of billions, not slashing taxes while driving the deficit through the roof.  The Pax Americana has led to the longest period of relative peace the world has ever known, and the greatest increase in global prosperity in history, due in no small part to our military keeping a stable global order.  But hey, that's an even more nuanced issue than unions, so I'm sure that concept is even further beyond your ability to grasp.  And who killed [Glass-Stegall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act)?  Was the House and Senate controlled by Republicans or Democrats?  Quelle surprise, it was Republicans.  > During debate in the House of Representatives, Rep. John Dingell (Democrat of Michigan) argued that the bill would result in banks becoming "too big to fail." Dingell further argued that this would necessarily result in a bailout by the Federal Government. The House passed its version of the Financial Services Act of 1999 on July 1, 1999, by a bipartisan vote of 34386 (Republicans 20516; Democrats 13869; Independent 01), two months after the Senate had already passed its version of the bill on May 6 by a much narrower 5444 vote along basically partisan lines (53 Republicans and 1 Democrat in favor; 44 Democrats opposed).  Who completely opposed it in the Senate? Democrats.  Who at least tried to force provisions protecting consumers into something Republicans could and were going do anyways, oh yeah, that was Democrats.  Idiotic hottake, from the start to the finish.  edit: I love the morons whose only recourse to push back to their idiotic narratives when faced with real facts is blocking.

Gas and groceries are certainly higher than they should be (be sure to thank your local (read: global) dystopian capitalism dealer), but unless you've got half a dozen kids to feed or a rig to refill, and you don't own your house (and sometimes even if you do), your paycheck is going to your fucking scummy landlord (I don't care if they're a nice guy; they're ripping you off and living fat off it, guaranteed). It doesn't help that you can't get a decent interest rate at the moment if you were in the market either. Housing prices are just insanely out of control (thank you fucking scummy corporate landlords).  I bought my house about ten years ago, at the end of the Obama administration, when interest rates were pretty damned low and housing prices weren't fucking crazy. My house is apparently worth twice what I payed for it then, and while I know that new carpet and refrigerator and landscaping are pretty f'kin swank (I am a poor luddite and have never had a fridge before that just gave me water on demand, but OMG), it's ridiculous to think its value has increased that much simply because I can walk around in my living room or my yard very comfortably barefoot with some on-demand H2O.  With that said, I pay about a third for my mortgage and insurance what anyone I know that rents pays in rent for comparably-sized housing (again, bought ten years ago; that's important for later). *And with that said,* I paid less than a fifth of that (my own current monthly home expenses) on gas and groceries for the week.  Extrapolating my own situation for comparison, I'm just gonna times that by about four for gas/groceries for a whole month, triple my monthly mortgage to my rent-burdened friends' levels, and I come out with something like me spending 19% of the take-home that I would spend on the combination of gas/groceries/rent on the gas and groceries, and 81% of that on the rent. For comparison, it's more like 41% gas/groceries and 59% mortgage for me currently. Again, that's not gross to expenses, just the shift in the ratios of those three specific things, and, obviously, it's just an anecdotal situation and quickMath, but it's a 22% shift in what would be my personal housing costs from then to now.  For another metric, in terms of my *total* take home, if I was renting, or paying for a house I  bought today, I'd have an entire paycheck eaten every month just to pay for rent/mortgage. Twice-a-month paycheck means I'm waaaaay over the 28% rule - almost doubled. That is not a sustainable way to live in our current economy, gas/groceries aside. That is the *ideal* position that far too many people in this country are in right now. Many are *so* much worse off.  *And all of that is to say, t*hat's fucking horrible and wrong and apparently the American way these days. Banks going bankrupt off their own hubris, grifters allowed to run free selling fake Internet money, a cozy relationship with hostile international interests that are inflating fuel and housing prices through controlled scarcity, and corporations pulling in record profits and *still having the gall to* blame it on supply chain problems caused by a plague *they went out of their way to exacerbate* by opposing recommended pandemic protocols, or an ongoing war in Eastern Europe that *they themselves are funding* through continuing to do business with Russia, simply because such decisions would hurt their "investors." Ok, calm it down girl...  This is what a Republican-led, deregulated capitalist wet dream has done to us and what it offers for our future and the future of this country. It has prioritized profit through bleeding out every last bit of hope from the American people, a percent at a time, even - and especially - the hope of being able to have a roof and a bed, a safe place to fucking sleep. To dream of something better.

So, please explain the procedure what happens if a child sues the parent and wins and after that the parent still returns the child support to the other parent. As long as the child is not neglected (doesn't live in hunger or whatever), there is nothing a child can do to force the parent to use the money in some particular way, which would exclude returning it to the other parent. Or if the child has this power, then why don't _all_ children have the power to force their parents to use their money in some other way than what the child wants? I don't understand why the children of single parents should have more control over their parent's use of money than other children.  Please explain why you think they should?  Finally, cut the hostility here. You're talking about the law as if everyone should know details of it and we haven't even established which country's law we're talking about.

I see a lot of value in a new space to discuss climate change differently,  because whenever I see existing discusssion on the subject it seems to just devolve into thousands of half hearted nihilistic comments.   I believe that part of this is because we aren't really perceiving the threat very well. When something is truly threatening your survival, you don't get nihilistic, you start thinking and you get creative. When you accurately perceive something threatening your future, you begin to act in order to preserve your survival. It's selfish, in a good way. It's like how innovation skyrockets during a total war. You can't help but try to innovate a way to survive, and hopefully we can get more people into that mindset sooner rather than later.   Then, I think a second aspect is that we don't know what to do. None of us can realistically stop the actions of all human kind. And each of us has just got one vote, and a bit of voting with dollars. It makes you feel powerless. And that fuels the cognitive dissonance and nihilistic outlook.   What I think that a new space to discuss climate change can provide us is a place to experiment with different ways of speaking and thinking about the issue. The value in that is that perhaps if it grows, different ways of thinking about the issue will become more common. So we can discuss concrete strategies (how to vote, how to behave, what large scale strategies are good ideas, etc.). And we can also deal different ways of understanding and approaching the topic itself here. Which I think is something powerful and underappreciated in itself. A sort of different memetics of climate change (to use the term in the way of describing communication itself more than just internet photos and things).

But there are certain realities that supporters of his, myself included, need to accept. Before you downvote, please consider what I've written.**  Did the media try to portray Bernie as a radical who would lose the general election? Yes.  Did the same thing happen in 2016, where Bernie performed incredibly well? Yes.  Did all of the moderates rally around Bernie's main opponent? Yes.        Did the same thing happen in 2016, where Bernie performed incredibly well? Yes.  So, I don't think we can blame the media, the moderates, or even the DNC for Bernie's loss. We have to blame the voters, and, in part, Bernie's campaign itself. Even before Pete, Amy, Beto, etcetera rallied around Joe, Bernie had substantially smaller percentages of the votes in the three earliest states. For example, Bernie received just around 26% in IA and NH compared to his the 50% in IA and 60% in NH in 2016. We have to realize that something changed between 2016 and 2020, in the hearts of the voters, and in Bernie's campaign to an extent. His plan to win was to simply rely on a crowded field to allow him to win the nomination with a like a quarter of the votes. He didn't really make a big effort to appeal to the moderates and, to an extent, the African-American community (which Joe won by a long shot). I think the voters chose Joe because they truly felt like he was the only one who could actually beat Donald Trump. And, being completely honest, they may have been right. I'm not sure Bernie would've won in 2020.  **His 2016 campaign was something very special that cannot and will be replicated.** One thing I feel as if I need to add is that the two-candidate aspect really helped him in 2016, as Hillary really wasn't the most popular candidate and a lot of voters wanted a non-establishment candidate. Also, a lot of his wins were in caucuses, were turnout is generally a lot lower. Still, his campaign was phenomenal.  While it's unfortunate that he lost in 2020, we have to accept that he did, due to the will of the voters. Thanks for reading, and Bernie 2024.

I also think we can, and do, still use the terms left and right sensibly in a two-axis system, though.   You can be conservative on economic policy (against big government trying to re-distribute wealth, for example), but socially and culturally progressive (where, e.g., you believe the government has no business dictating who people can and cannot marry, just because marriage was traditionally a union between a man and a woman).   The fact that the American political system cant comfortably accommodate those two axes for people who are left on one but right on the other, or vice versa, doesnt imply that if we came up with different terms, it suddenly would.   In Europe, the two-axis system is taught and used in high school. In my experience, 14-year-olds have no trouble understanding it, or situating individual policy proposals and entire political parties somewhere on it. When the time comes (and thats at sixteen now, for EU elections), they will have the option of identifying as economically left or right, and socio-culturally left or right. And they will know, by and large, who to vote for accordingly. But thats because we, here on the other side of the Atlantic, mostly dont think in terms of red versus blue (the Brits still sort of do, but they dont count, since they fashion themselves more a of junior USA than a part of Europe, anyway ;)).   We have a wider menu of options, here. And people *still* complain they dont know who to vote for, or that they dont feel truly represented by anyone, but IMO thats more a function of everyone having to compromise once they get to a position of actual power, than it is a sign that our terminology cant capture the disparate points of view represented in our different parties.   We do have, for example, parties that are on the left economically (heavily into active wealth redistribution for those they consider deserving of it), but far to the right socially and culturally. Our country belongs to those who have always lived here, so immigration should be stopped; gay marriage, euthanasia, abortion rights, etc., should be abolished, because thats not the way sky daddy intended things to work; at the same time, we dont like the people who believe in a different sky daddy than we historically did, even if they want mostly the same things we do, because we were here first, so neener neener, go back to your shit hole and have your five prayers a day and your hijab there, where we dont have to see it.   The opposite exists, as well. Those we call liberals are economically pretty far to the right, but socially progressive, both in the name of freedom.  And then there are parties who are left on both axes, right on both axes, left of center on specific issues while right on others, etc.   Terminology is not the problem. Representation is. And if your argument is that the American political system is very bad at accurately representing the actual diversity of viewpoints held among its voters, then I agree with you wholeheartedly. I also think remedying that requires getting rid of winner takes all, in favor of actually proportional representation, and replacing the electoral college with something that gives *all* of the people a fighting chance at having their voices heard in presidential elections, rather than a change in terminology.

I do not read your sub often, I have two young kids, work full time and maybe 1-1.5 hours of free time on my hands per day, so just the incredibly overwhelming idea of moving towards an actual zerowaste lifestyle seems far too daunting to me. I have no problem with it, I'm not against it, I just don't know how I'd do it when the world seems to prevent it at every turn.   What I'd like to see from such a large user base (and something maybe you guys do things like this I just don't know about), is to maintain lists of products, companies, etc who are the worst offenders of things like single use plastics or the like that people can realistically agree to boycott. Legislation is the easiest way to cut down the metaphorical forest of companies that contribute to our waste issues, but I think as individuals if we could rally against a specific company (and then move onto more companies), we can start chopping them down one at a time. If enough people were on board it could really shake up to the market.   I don't have the time to find the most zerowaste solution all the time--I feel like it would be more reasonable for me to say no to a few things, and if a large enough crowd did that it could really inspire something.

First of all, terrorists have killed well over 40 children in Israel. And the huge difference is that they did it on purpose. 13,000 dead children in Gaza is a huge lie by Hamas. Israel knows it has killed between 13,000 and 15,000 Hamas men. If the number of total dead that Hamas gives is true (and there is no way to verify it), it is completely impossible that there are 13,000 dead children. Unless "children" also includes 17-year-olds fighting with Hamas (and who largely contributed to the October 7 rapes and massacre). In Israel, Palestinians (both Hamas men and "civilians") purposefully slaughtered infants. There is a huge moral difference.  Then I remind you of a few things: Gaza had not been occupied since 2005, and Hamas is not fighting against the occupation, but against the existence of Israel and Jews. So if it is your motivation to be pro-Palestinian in this war, evidently you agree with the genocide of Jews? Moreover, the occupation of the West Bank is a consequence of the Arab war against Israel, not the cause.   However, since you claim you were with Israel at the beginning of the war (and I have a hard time believing you), how would you have wiped out Hamas, without killing civilians, since Hamas is hiding among them?

Records from these paleo events, coupled with biogeochemical modeling, provide clear evidence that with continued warming, the modern oceans will experience substantial deoxygenation. There are, however, few constraints from the geologic record on the effects of rapid warming under icehouse conditions. We document a C-cycle perturbation that occurred under an Earth system state experiencing recurrent glaciation. A suite of proxies suggests increased seafloor anoxia during this event in step with abrupt increase in CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. Warming-mediated increases in marine anoxia may be more pronounced in a glaciated versus unglaciated climate state.  **Abstract**  Piecing together the history of carbon (C) perturbation events throughout Earths history has provided key insights into how the Earth system responds to abrupt warming. Previous studies, however, focused on short-term warming events that were superimposed on longer-term greenhouse climate states. Here, we present an integrated proxy (C and uranium [U] isotopes and paleo CO2) and multicomponent modeling approach to investigate an abrupt C perturbation and global warming event (304 Ma) that occurred during a paleo-glacial state. We report pronounced negative C and U isotopic excursions coincident with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and a biodiversity nadir. The isotopic excursions can be linked to an injection of 9,000 Gt of organic matterderived C over 300 kyr and to near 20% of areal extent of seafloor anoxia. Earth system modeling indicates that widespread anoxic conditions can be linked to enhanced thermocline stratification and increased nutrient fluxes during this global warming within an icehouse.

I think the UK's reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic is a good explainer here. I feel that to begin with, most people were kind of all right with isolating themselves. Even when it caused a great deal of inconvenience, even when people had to miss their relatives' funerals, there was a somewhat comradely feeling of 'We're taking one for the team.' Similar to the world's reaction in WWII - you might be living through awful circumstances, but you're staying firm on the ground and getting by as best you can.  But then, Dominic Cummings drove to Barnard Castle. And I think at that moment, the collective mood dropped. Suddenly it was a feeling of, 'The wealthy aren't doing it, so why the hell do I have to?' And I think that's completely understandable. If we're all in it together, people will do their bit. If we're not, they'll priorities their own immediate comfort.  I think it's the same here. People feel that no matter how much they try to fight for a liveable planet, the actions of the most powerful people in the world will make all their efforts for nothing. There's nothing like the feeling that it's all worthless to breed a sense of complete apathy. And in some respects, you can argue that they're seeing something true about the world there - it is the powerful doing the vast majority of the polluting and the burning.  And I think the solution to that feeling is to remember that everyone who has ever achieved anything was told at some point that there wasn't much point even trying. There was a time no one thought slavery would end, or that the Berlin Wall would ever come down. We were successful in that, and I honestly believe we'll be successful in this, in the end. Just not as successful as we should be. We'll be successful in a way that makes us think, 'A lot more amazing people and animals would still be alive if we'd just been a little bit better.'

(This is kind of important, because for CO2 and methane, our observational record and bottom-up inventories don't necessarily agree still on higher resolutions scales, closer to the scale which we can actually mitigate emissions at).  Understanding and developing better versions of different parts of climate models is important work. Many of them use (sometimes necessary) assumptions to model physical processes, such as sea-ice loss, which can always be improved upon to better understand how the next couple of decades will play out.   Honestly, the list in pretty endless. I wouldn't worry too much about doing the most you can, and worry about doing something that you're interested in and motivated to do. Sounds like you're on a pretty good track already.

Within logic, there are valid processes and invalid processes(fallacies). Valid processes are 100 percent guaranteed to be true if the premises are true. Invalid premises do not quite reach this mark.   However, for hundreds of years now, it's been realized that this is often too strict a standard. Therefore other frameworks for assessing usefulness have developed. We developed science, we developed probability theory, we developed risk/reward, we developed practicality and utility. These are all based on fallacious reasoning, but emerged because they were useful and practical, though not absolute.   In this way, appeals to authority are always fallacies but are still useful and practical. They can be wise and prudent, but they cannot be perfect.

He answers the question comprehensively.  In short, anyone who is legally authorized (under state or federal law) to evaluate officeholder eligibility may enforce Section 3. This could mean a secretary of state deciding whether to include someone on a ballot under state law. It could mean a judge or jury determining whether a candidate has made a false statement in their qualification papers. It could mean presidential electors deciding to perform their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution during the Electoral College vote. It could mean Congress deciding whether to impeach someone for being "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."  This structure makes perfect sense, because the American experiment is based on principles of federalism and decentralized power. Officers do not swear an oath to a king, but to the Constitution itself. Hence, it is the responsibility and duty of the *entire* constitutional system to enforce the oath depending on the specific legal procedure that applies to a given situation.  The system is not "off the rails." It is the American experiment - an experiment based on the fundamental principle that humanity should be governed by laws, and not by kings.

I'm pretty surprised to see the sentiment in the first 50 comments (I just stopped) here. The vast majority have a 'We can slow it down, it wont be so bad' or 'The author in the article doesn't know what he's talking about'.   My favorite: 'Capping all the methane leaks would be a good start.'  All are rife with a form of denialism or wild ignorance to the reality of the situation, weirdly akin to 'Don't look up'. While no one here seems to be denying the problem exists, there is a complete disconnect from the scale of the problem to tackle and the profound shifts in life that would need to occur to even begin making a dent.  Everything below would need MASSIVE and IMMEDIATE reduction to even have a hope of reducing the risk of triggering runaway warming due to a cascading feedback loop of failures (global jet stream breakdown, Blue Ocean Event, The Clathrate Gun hypothesis, etc).  What would need drastic and immediate reduction:  Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, and CO2 emissions represent roughly 97 percent of the global warming potential of all greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.  The average commercial flight emits 53.3 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) per mile, or 0.024 metric tons. This means that a 2,500-mile cross-country flight, such as from New York to Los Angeles, would produce 133,250 pounds of CO2 emissions.  **There are an average of 40 million flights per year.**  A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The emissions from cargo transport vehicles is 5x  **There are 1.7 billion cars on the roads world wide, the majority being in the U.S. and China**  **Power generation in the US alone, (Coal, Methane, Petroleum, etc) accounts for about 33% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions, while the electric power sector accounted for about 31%.**   This doesn't even touch the emissions from Oil & Gas industries, Textiles, Plastics, Chemical and Heavy Industries.  The agricultural sector is the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and is responsible for a large portion of total GHG emissions.  That means, the food we eat, the clothes we buy, the business we conduct, the homes we build, the products we buy and the packaging it comes in, the way it gets to us; or we get to it, the places you go, etc.. would ALL have to change (and outright stop).. now, globally. Not 'soon', not 'in the coming decades'..  **..and that is simply not going to happen. WHY? Money.** Money is the god that those in control worship. We can't allow anything that threatens profits, no sir.   Nothing I've said here today is new information; It's been known for decades.  Once a 'Blue Ocean Event' occurs, which is imminent, the albedo of the earth greatly reduces, triggering a cascade of effects that lead directly to an exponential increase in warming. The permafrost melt in the east Siberian artic shelf, one of the largest methane deposits on earth at ~1400 BILLION tons, where a relatively tiny 'burp' release of currently trapped methane can increase the global temperature average by 3-5 ADDTIONAL degrees. That means within 3 years, billions dead from heat and starvation, wide-scale infrastructure failures, global crop failures annually, catastrophic rapid sea level rise, etc, etc.. of course this would unite us as a species and bring out our very best traits; We would finally band together in harmony and unity to focus on our collective survival.. and it definitely wouldn't look anything like a Mad Max + Waterworld scenario

You can volunteer at environmental meetings and protests. You can start exercising daily and meditating as these are both necessary for a balanced nervous system because even though we are thinking beings it ends up that our nervous system is calling the shots. You can start educating yourself on climate related science and engage with people you meet who are also aware of the current climate (pun intended).

The literature on the comparative evaluation of climate policy instruments has focused overwhelmingly on economic analyses of instruments aimed at restricting demand for greenhouse gas emissions (especially carbon taxes and cap-and-trade schemes) and, to some extent, on instruments that support the supply of or demand for substitutes for emissions-intensive goods, such as renewable energy. Evaluation of instruments aimed at restricting the upstream supply of commodities or products whose downstream consumption causes greenhouse gas emissionssuch as fossil fuelshas largely been neglected in this literature. Moreover, analyses that compare policy instruments using both economic and political (e.g. political feasibility and feedback) criteria are rare. This article aims to help bridge both of these gaps. Specifically, the article demonstrates that restrictive supply-side policy instruments (targeting fossil fuels) have numerous characteristic economic and political advantages over otherwise similar restrictive demand-side instruments (targeting greenhouse gases). Economic advantages include low administrative and transaction costs, higher abatement certainty (due to the relative ease of monitoring, reporting and verification), comprehensive within-sector coverage, some advantageous price/efficiency effects, the mitigation of infrastructure lock-in risks, and mitigation of the green paradox. Political advantages include the superior potential to mobilise public support for supply-side policies, the conduciveness of supply-side policies to international policy cooperation, and the potential to bring different segments of the fossil fuel industry into a coalition supportive of such policies. In light of these attributes, restrictive supply-side policies squarely belong in the climate policy toolkit.

Morgan Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. were the firms which set up the Jekyll Island Conference at which the Federal Reserve Act was drafted, who directed the subsequent successful campaign to have the plan enacted into law by Congress, and who purchased the controlling amounts of stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914. These firms had their principal officers appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Advisory Council in 1914.

Maybe we accelarate it a bit? with our lifestyle? But I'm not sure we're creating the issue if it exists.  Like I wrote to someone else - stop turning it into a circus. People will always change only when we're already too late. If we are, nothing you can do about it besides making adjustments about your own life and building your own life.  The current chaos in the media and overall doomsday kinda atmosphere that's been established these past two years is not helping anything, it's not leading to anything other than just tensions between people, etc. Rational, kinda cool heads approach is not completely gone, but it's pretty drowned out by now so much, it's just emotions and pressure first and facts and sensible discussion afterwards.   Most of us don't know shit or can't affect much. These family arguments with older parents about what's happening and then venting online about it...while leading the same lifestyle we all do in the western world. Is it getting us anywhere ?  Earth isn't going anywhere, neither is nature. Apart from that, all we can do is work with hard data. Like I know some of you, or you might've read some online articles about AMOC that have appeared recently, but is that it? How deep did you go about the issue? What is your research? Are you really someone who is an objective authority due to at least reading numerous reports, scientific works, etc. on the issue? Or are you just going by news bits? Objectively.   This needs to be filtered out, the opinions which are informed and legitimate, and which are just internet know-it-alls parroting something they do not really understand.

(These are a definite no no)   \- Anyone who rejects the separation between church and state is also too traditional. This might rile some feathers, but Christian Democrats believe in the separation of church and state. We are not integralists or theocrats or dominionistic theologians. However, this does not mean we accept a secular state.   \- The Christian right is too traditional. The Christian Right is the right wing younger brother of Christian Democracy, so we do have similar views on things like abortion and SSM. However, on other matters, the Christian Right is eccentric. Like on Israel and the UN.

Yet no large-scale assessments of threat management strategies exist. Applying a structured participatory approach, we demonstrate that existing conservation efforts are insufficient in a changing world, estimating that 65% (at best 37%, at worst 97%) of native terrestrial taxa and land-associated seabirds are likely to decline by 2100 under current trajectories. Emperor penguins are identified as the most vulnerable taxon, followed by other seabirds and dry soil nematodes. We find that implementing 10 key threat management strategies in parallel, at an estimated present-day equivalent annual cost of US$23 million, could benefit up to 84% of Antarctic taxa. Climate change is identified as the most pervasive threat to Antarctic biodiversity and influencing global policy to effectively limit climate change is the most beneficial conservation strategy. However, minimising impacts of human activities and improved planning and management of new infrastructure projects are cost-effective and will help to minimise regional threats. Simultaneous global and regional efforts are critical to secure Antarctic biodiversity for future generations.  _______________________  Related Material(s):  - [The Paris Agreement objectives will likely halt future declines of emperor penguins](https://www2.whoi.edu/site/jenouvrier/wp-content/uploads/sites/118/2021/02/Jenouvrier_et_al-2019-Global_Change_Biology.pdf) (pdf)  - [Threat to the Penguin Empire - virtual symposium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGqh5ozeeAk&t=1830s) (time stamped to scenarios): WHOI seabird biologist Stephanie Jenouvrier gives a virtual symposium at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography about her work to model and predict the fate of emperor penguins in Antarctica during a time of rapid change.

Apologies for the snap judgment - a frequent way that some folks (who may not be engaging in the discussion in good faith) try to attack the discourse here is with a "Gish Gallop" - a set of questions or statements which on their face may seem to gel together, but logically don't necessary follow (or may be flawed or just too numerous to debunk/correct in detail).  At a high level, the argument weaves a few incorrect assertions into a set of statements which are really a red herring. For instance, the opening statements are more or less irrelevant when we consider contemporary climate change. So what if CO2 was much higher in the past? The original  author conveniently omits the fact that in the geological record, historical CO2 levels strongly correlate with sea level estimates (think about it - a warmer world, less glacial ice, higher sea levels). But this is silly; you can't directly compare geological climates with the present day one because (a) orbital characteristics strongly dominate geological climate patterns and (b) so too does the configuration of the continents. It's a wholly misleading way to look at the story.  A few other critical factual mis-statements:  1. No one seriously feared an "ice age" in the 1970's (e.g. [here](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1)), and the ones that *did* were concerned with massive increases in the emissions of aerosol/air pollution - which **does** noticeably cool the climate 2. Just because a place gets warmer doesn't mean it could become arable - for instance, vast swaths of the Russian and Canadian tundra get extremely little precipitation, and a wholly different balance of direct/diffuse radiation, so there is no reason to expect without other details that they'd become a new "bread basket" of the world. 3. To go along with it, yes - it's true that under **ideal, controlled settings**, increasing CO2 can increase plant productivity - but those idealized settings also include abundance of nutrients, water, and other resources which may become scarcer under climate change in a given region. 4. Finally, there is no threat for a glaciation on the timescale of human civilization. Yes, it *would* be bad if global temperatures dropped 10 degrees and an Ice Age occurred. But it ain't gonna happen, so what's the author's point?  Usually Gish Gallops like this have no internal logic framing the argument. They're an episode of Family Guy - a set of *non sequitors* loosely hung around a ridiculous plot. Just change the channel.

Medicare for All Is a Central Demand of Our Time  Too often, Americans lack the sense of safety and belonging that people enjoy in countries with a robust health care system that, in every case, is based around a universal health care program. No wonder so many of us succumb to diseases of despair.  The cornerstone plank of both the 2016 and 2020 presidential bids launched by Bernie was Medicare for All, so its no surprise that he dedicates an entire chapter to assailing the disaster that is American health care. Not only do we as a country spend more for less per capita on health care, we are also witnessing a marked decrease in life expectancy. Sanders even goes on to say that, because of these conditions, Medicare for All might be the most integral part of a political revolution in the United States. In a very literal sense, the fight for Medicare for All is a fight not just for decency in one of the richest countries in the world, but a fight for our very lives.  ##5. Youre Either on the Side of Workers or Youre on the Side of Their Bosses  Which side are you on? These days, corporations like Starbucks and Amazon dont hire gun-toting thugs. Instead they hire anti-union consultants and pollsters and politically connected lobbyists  many of them Democrats  to thwart union organizing. But the fundamental premise remains: youre either on the side of workers and organized labor, or youre not.  Invoking the famous labor anthem Which Side Are You On? written by Florence Reece of Tennessee, Bernie draws a clear line in the sand on the issue of labor. Either one is with the working class, or theyre against the working class. Sanders hits this note repeatedly throughout the book, that there is a class war ongoing in this country, and in the sixth chapter he does not flinch from how this applies to our struggle today. To be clear-sighted is to acknowledge what Amazon, Starbucks, and a plethora of politicians from across the two-party system are trying to do, which is keep the workers down.  ##6. New Technology Wont Solve the Old Problems of Ownership and Control  The machinery may have changed, but the imbalance between economic elites and the working class has not. Nor has the injustice that extends from that imbalance.  In a chapter largely focused on the future of the economy as it pertains to technology, Bernie centers an important question that doesnt get asked very often. When it comes to how automation might occur, or how artificial intelligence affects certain jobs, who actually gets to decide how this develops? Do workers have a say? Will workers still have dignity? Who should actually be in charge of industries and the broader economy?  These are questions that Eugene V. Debs asked one hundred years ago, and while weve certainly evolved technologically since then, the questions are yet to be answered.  ##7. A Democratic Society Demands Equal Education for All  Historically, progressives were at the forefront of education debates, battling to establish free public education, to open schools to all students, to build great schools in urban and rural areas, and to fully fund them. There was a forward motion to our activism.  In a chapter on education, Sanders takes a look at the advances weve made since the modern era began. Weve achieved public education for children up to roughly eighteen years of age, but is that education working? Are our teachers treated fairly? What about those who want to go to college? For those who want to advance the struggle for a prosperous and democratic society, we must return to our roots and seek not only to reform but also to expand education and access to it.  ##8. There Is No Middle Ground in the Struggles to Come  There is not a middle ground between the insatiable greed of uber-capitalism and a fair deal for the working class. There is not a middle ground as to whether or not we save the planet. There is not a middle ground about whether or not we preserve our democracy and remain a society based on equal protection for all.  Toward the end of the book, Bernie threads the needle on all the aforementioned issues and much more by making the case in as certain terms as possible: there is no middle ground between the dignity of the working class and the wants of the capitalist class, and there is in fact no middle ground between democracy and extreme inequality.  Sanders not only wants people already engaged in politics to move toward his program, but he wants millions of people to organize wherever they are: in their neighborhoods, in their workplaces, and on the electoral and educational planes as well.

To go further, if you knew how our poverty rate is one of the highest in developed countries, and how a lack of safety nets, too many jobs dont pay enough, and healthcare is so expensive. Then maybe youd wonder if it makes sense to tax the rich some more and help out all the struggling people, if you want to lower crime, and divorces, both parents being overworked and cant raise their kids right, depressions, abortions, suicides, etc.   It all goes back to financial stress and lack of monetary power to make things right for them.

Any moral or logical questions rely upon definitions, especially with the abstract nature of ethics and human rights, but I think youre saying with your statement hate speech is free speech is that restricting hate speech is a violation of the innate right to free speech.   Lets examine negative rights, which you also called innate. I have a right to choose what to put into my body, and I assume youd agree with that as an innate right. I dont have the innate right to those things themselves, though  I need to hunt or grow or buy the food or drugs or find a stick I shove up my ass, or whatever. My access to those things is not guaranteed to me simply because I exist.   It is easy to see how I could infringe on the rights of others by stealing or deceiving them or taking by force. Human social groups have had many different ways to prevent or punish those who violate those rights of possession, and most societies have some sort of codified system of laws.   Those systems are designed with the intent to protect the rights of people who cannot or make the choice not to pay whatever cost (of violence or risk or whatever) to prevent the violation by themselves  they rely on the collective trust and respect for others or the law to protect their interests. This means every member of the group can spend a lot less of their resources on defending their property and focus on something more beneficial to themselves and the group at large.   You may say that speech is not the same as violence or theft, and thats true. But its also true that speech can result in the violation of the rights of others.   One example is dishonesty, which is often a part of hate speech but not necessarily, and there are many categories of dishonest speech that are not hate speech. But if there is a group of people combining their resources and efforts to tell everyone that a veterinarian is sexually abusing the animals in their care because the boss of that group didnt like the bill the veterinarian gave them. What can the veterinarian do to if that group is the only newspaper in town, and all their business comes from people who read that newspaper? Now the vegetarians livelihood and service to the community is threatened, and regardless of their reputation beforehand, there will be some cost they will pay to defend themself. They could spend time and go door-to-door and tell everyone they dont fuck dogs, or put up flyers, or send out letters, but the collective resources of the newspaper creates an unfair disadvantage for the veterinarian. But there are laws for libel and defamation! With those laws, the newspaper may never publish the unsubstantiated dishonest claims about the veterinarian or if they still do, they can be found liable and pay for the damages to the veterinarian their actions caused.   But dishonesty is still free speech. Some guy could say that about the veterinarian to a potential love interest who was going on her third date with the vet. Its very unlikely that any lawsuit would prevail, because its not an issue of power imbalance and scope that the veterinarians life would be affected or that he couldnt defend himself against the claim of one random guy. So the context of limiting dishonest speech is relevant to the question of limiting speech, based on the harm that is threatened and the harm that is caused.   Hopefully, you can see the way this extend to hate speech. There is hate speech that IS free speech, and isnt restricted. The measure of regulating innate rights is taken by evaluating the effects of exercising those rights  there is a threshold at which the right to defend oneself becomes murder, or where dishonesty becomes defamation, or where hateful speech becomes hate speech.   Theres a reasonable debate about where to draw that line, but theres not much of one that I can see for no threshold whatsoever, at least in the structure of a functioning society.

The initial land that was settled was bought from a variety of Arab landowners who held legal claim to the land at the time.   Whether they had a right to sell it is another discussion entirely. Most did not live there or have any connection to the land and were based in cities such as Damascus.   European Jews killing Arabs immediately is also not entirely correct. It's not incorrect either. Directly following the announcement of the Israeli state - the Arab Israeli war of 1948 erupted as surrounding Arab states simultaneously attacked israel. Israel won the war, captured land and kept it.   In the 6 day war of 1967, a similar scenario unfolded, with Arab nations blocking israels maritime access and amassing invading forces on their borders. This time Israel preemptively struck and successfully destroyed the grounded Egyptian airforce. Additionally they launched ground attacks and captured Gaza, along with a few more territories. Again, they kept what they captured.  I'm not defending Israel, their settlements on the west bank are crimes against humanity. Currently a genocide is being committed, however, we do need to consider that their are other hands in play which directly turn Palestine into a meat grinder, and they're hiding out in foreign countries making decisions which directly impact and contribute to the genocide. There are no good guys. Only Palestinian victims caught in the middle of a fucked up power play, rooted in the Ottoman empire.

AsYehudit BarskyandEhud Rosenshow in a meticulous study, these groups, along with a host of other jihadist organizations and ideological tendenciessome of which are sponsored by Iranhave played a crucial role in rising anti-Semitism. Barsky and Rosen write:  In recent years, U.S. Islamist groups and leaders have increasingly sought common cause with progressive left-wing groups that promote minority rights and intersectionality among racial, ethnic, and religious minorities in their efforts to build coalitions around common interests. In doing so, the Islamist groups and the progressive left-wing organizations have formed a red-green alliance, a coalition that crosses ideological lines between the far left (red) and the Islamists (green). Such coalitions are built both by forming a narrative of the victimhood of U.S. Muslims, and by utilizing the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, portraying it as an anti-colonial struggle. This has already brought about the formation of a new type of hybrid group that brings together under one roof activists of various fringe backgrounds. While the FBI hate-crime statistics showed that the number of anti-Islamic incidents in 2020 and 2021 were among the lowest in a decade (110 and 152 incidents, respectively), U.S. Islamists have been labelling any criticism of Islam and Muslims as well as of themselves and their ideologies as Islamophobia. For example, the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, [which praised Qaradawi after his death], has attempted to utilize public discourse at a time when anti-Semitic attacks on American Jews have been at their highest in four decades to suggest that anti-Semitism is minimal in comparison to Islamophobia. . . . The use of anti-Semitism to undermine [Jews] political and societal standing is often not considered a calculated threat. Viewed over time, however, it can be understood as part of a larger process of societal erosion in which extremist and anti-Semitic beliefs previously thought to exist on the fringes of society become legitimized as part of the mainstream and normative public discourse. . . . These developments should not be ignored. . . . To this end, the process of choosing allies from the Muslim community should be made much more carefully, and proper due diligence is required.

Romans 12:18 underscore this idea: If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men. God is most pleased when parties can resolve their problems thereby eliminating any need for war. At the same time, this principle is often misused by the wrongful party: Is the perpetrating nation using drawn-out negotiations as a stall tactic while they prepare to do evil? The rightful party should not be nave to this; there comes a time when it is obvious that the grace of one party is being taken advantage of by the other to unjustly delay what in the end will be necessary: the just use of force. War should always be the last resort.  F. PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS  It is foolish to enter into a war unless there is a high probability of success. Luke 14:31 buoys the biblical basis of this principle: Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty thousand? When answering the question of the probability of success of entering a war, the obvious considerations of counting the cost must be taken into account. Determining what a successful effort to go to war will cost is difficult, and each incident is different with its own set of circumstances. The point of this study is not to delve into those weeds, but to point out that weighing the probability of success and the cost of biblically-based considerations are vital before determining to enter into a war.  G. PROPORTIONALITY OF RESULTS  Will the good results stemming from the success of the war objectives be greater than the losses that will inevitably occur from pursuing the war? Luke 14:28 speaks to this principle: For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it? Even though God states that governments are to carry thesword. to avenge wrath upon the one who practices evil,it doesnt always follow that the good achieved by avenging the evil is outweighed by the additional harm that could result to innocent bystanders. Perhaps the proportionality of results will increase with patience or further creativity manifest in the timing or type of war utilized. Such considerations going into war are certainly undergirded by Scripture in order to correctly ascertain Gods will in the decision. Using ISIS as an example, if cutting off their supply lines have greater proportional results, is it wiser to do that than it is to attempt to fight an embedded enemy? One need calculate and weigh the costs and benefits of his war strategy before waging it.  H. RIGHT SPIRIT  All war must be undertaken with great reluctance, sobriety and counsel. Those who engage the force of war must do so with great sorrow. Psalm 68:30d speaks about those who delight in war: He has scattered the peoples who delight in war. Given the pain of punishment, the inevitability of harming innocent people, and the overall further setbacks that will occur to the nation and its citizens, for any individual or nation to gleefully enter into combat is to be woefully displeasing to God. This last criterion of theJust War Theory,likened to all that precede it, are principles substantiated by Scripture.  V. SUMMARY OF THE JUST WAR THEORY  When the aforementioned criteria are carefully and corporately reasoned and it is just and righteous to go to war, then a nation must engage with its full force, intense focus and all out power in a quest for immediate and decisive victory. In response to fulfillment of all the elements of theJust War Theorywhen it is just and righteous to go to war, what results can in no way be a half-hearted response! When it is just and right to go to war a nation cannot respond flaccidly with less than clear objectives! Winston Churchill, when faced with the inevitability of engaging Nazi Germany worked through and fulfilled all the above criteria with Parliament. In entering the war, he personally emulated this ensuing right spirit and resolve  what necessarily must follow when justifiably and righteously a nation enters a war. In his address to Parliament in 1940 he said,  Let us therefore brace ourselves to do our duty, and so bear ourselves that, if the British Commonwealth and its Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will still say, This was their finest hour. And what is our aim? . . . Victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror; victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.  Churchill serves as an executive model for properly leading a nation into war. When war is justified and righteous, a countrys leadership should never enter into it with low testosterone. It is an all or nothing commitment of the totality of the nation in its decisive quest for all out victory as quickly as possible

The golden rule's very wording requires you to first consider how you want to be treated by others and then apply that same attitude towards them. It's *putting your perspective onto them and hoping for reciprocity*.   Empathy is *understanding and taking on the perspective of others*. The golden rule and empathy can both exist completely apart. Empathy is a virtue, but are you saying that if you put yourself in the shoes of farm animals they're feeling "this life is suffering, I would rather I(and my entire species) not exist"? Because that's exactly what would happen if there's no food interest to raise all these animals.     >I don't see how lessening pain and maximizing happiness could ever be argued as anything other than a net positive for the world (assuming we have the choice, and we do).

My gripe is that animals have very little place in a moral system, they can't act at all according to any morality. The most convincing reason that directly hurting animals is bad is that it suggests a person with a character more likely to harm other people. Morality is something made by and for people, I don't see how animals can be moralized outside of how they relate to a person.

The cops show up and joke and laugh at this dead homeless guy.    The next mornin.  Jesus wakes up on earth again. Cursing god for this existence hes been given.    The son of god is unbelievable to all of those who he is trying to save.  They believe the prosperity gospel preachers over him expressing that following those preachers is a path to hell.

So I specialized in understanding as many and as much as I can and forming own ideas out of it, which otherwise would just take a couple extra years to create..   I guess the important thing is, that you are aware what kind of work you want to do, so what makes you fun and gives you a feeling of achieving something (let it be research, entrepreneurship, politics, activism, education or anything else). In the end it is all working together and in the best case, you will have a network where people from all these sectors are included. :)   So just keep it flowing, stay curious, do your own research, don't let yourself be limited by anything and just do your thing. That's bascially the best advise I feel qualified to give.   I wish you good luck and am also starting to become curious where your path will be leading you to. :)

Both situations being a warming ocean.  Because the current global warming is being cause by extra CO2 released in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is thus saturated in CO2 relative to the ocean and so the ocean has to absorb some of it to reach equilibrium. However, the rate at which it absorbs CO2 is slightly slowed by the fact that the oceans themselves are warming and warmer oceans hold less dissolved gas. In the end, human emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere wins out that battle and so in the net, the oceans are still taking up CO2. It is thought that this could swing the other way and the ocean could become a net source of CO2 if human emissions decline but the ocean continues to warm.  The case of ice age cycling from a cold climate to a warm climate is different. There, the initial perturbation is not the emission of fossil fuel CO2 but instead perturbing a state from equilibrium by a slow warming due to changes in Earth's orbit. This slow warming eventually causes a warming of the ocean, which outgasses some of its CO2, which leads to more warming, etc (it's a positive feedback).

Prior to the British Mandate, the land currently known as Israel-Palestine was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, hardly a sovereign Palestinian Nation.  The narrative I see is of a land colonised for centuries with multiple populations. Two of these nations (Jews and Palestinians) developed national aspirations relating to the land in the late 19th/early 20th century.  Although there was migration of Jews to Palestine, this was usually due to persecution. I disagree with your characterisation of a colonialist endeavour (ie a powerful nation trying to extend its territory) or collaboration with the colonial powers of the time.   Indeed, Jewish migration was often against the wishes of the colonial power of the Ottomans and laterly Britain (for example the White Paper, Exodus 1947).  These two rival populations continued to fight Britain and each other for control of the land, culminating in the events of 1948.  I wonder what you make of this narrative?  Really nice to have some constructive dialogue on here (for once!)

Capitalism requires the state to restrain companies, and it never does a great job (I think large corporations are way too big, for instance), but it does allow for individual success. This is in contrast to socialism, which requires increasing amounts of bureaucratic authoritarianism in order to incentivize production, and has resulted in totalitarianism in every single application. Both systems have baked in corruption, but there is no comparison to work/life under the threat of violence at the hands of a bureaucrat, ie, communism. Even if it's partially an illusion, I'll take democratic capitalism every time. There are exactly zero examples of a free society under communism.

An example of this is the [Union Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Party_(United_States)) of 1936 which ran as a Populist alternative to FDR's New Deal. Many of the people advocating for it were Far-Right demagogues during the Depression.  You are right that Distributism is very decentralized by nature. It is also wrong to think that Distributism is inherently fascist.  That being said, I think there is a good reason to view it as an ideology influenced heavily by Catholic Traditionalism, which probably will mean more people from the Far-Right will be drawn towards it.  As for the parts about Christian Democracy arising in the Anglo-sphere. The UK is the only place I could really imagine it happening. The US is very individualistic and both parties have their reasons to oppose communitarianism.  I do think the ASP has a shot of growing more influence possibly to rival the Libertarians and Greens in terms of size. Though, I think if any real change could ever come from Christian Democrats it needs to be by abandoning any ties to the Far-right. A good way might be to present it as a centrist alternative to both parties, but they also need a more coherent worldview.  I think the best way to get CD out of the fringes is to find more think tanks that will promote the consistent life ethic, family values, social justice, care for the weak combo. I mean, they need to get more invested in deeper social issues, get in touch with intellectuals and advocate real solutions in line with these values. A lot of the stuff the ASP is putting out is very philosophical, but they need to get more into the niddy-griddy detail of different policy issues. Maybe make newspapers or podcasts or something. Instead of running third parties, another strategy might be to give them a SuperPac and lobbying groups. Build a base of CD's in both parties and have them work together. This way, they might grow a presence. Though like I said it needs to honor democracy, abandon populism, and abandon anything resembling the theocratic tendencies of the GOP. I think a more secular movement based on Christian ethics would be better.  I'm not trying to shit mercilessly on distributism, but advocating any system this far out of the mainstream that public doesn't understand will just make it look out of touch with the political realities.  Keep in mind, this is just my opinion, I am not even really a Christian Democrat. It is just a belief system that I have some sympathies with on certain areas.

Central to ongoing and future changes is the marine ice sheet instability: once a critical threshold, or tipping point, is crossed, ice internal dynamics can drive a self-sustaining retreat committing a glacier to irreversible, rapid and substantial ice loss. This process might have already been triggered in the Amundsen Sea region, where Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers dominate the current mass loss from Antarctica, but modelling and observational techniques have not been able to establish this rigorously, leading to divergent views on the future mass loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we aim at closing this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic investigation of the stability regime of Pine Island Glacier. To this end we show that early warning indicators in model simulations robustly detect the onset of the marine ice sheet instability. We are thereby able to identify three distinct tipping points in response to increases in ocean-induced melt. The third and final event, triggered by an ocean warming of approximately 1.2 C from the steady-state model configuration, leads to a retreat of the entire glacier that could initiate a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

This study reconstructs the history of sea level at the Bering Strait by tracing the influence of Pacific waters in the Arctic Ocean. We find that the Bering Strait was open from at least 46,000 until 35,700 y ago, thus dating the last formation of the land bridge to within 10,000 y of the LGM. This history requires that ice volume increased rapidly into the LGM. In addition, it appears that humans migrated to the Americas as soon as the formation of the land bridge allowed for their passage.  **Abstract**  The cyclic growth and decay of continental ice sheets can be reconstructed from the history of global sea level. Sea level is relatively well constrained for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26,500 to 19,000 y ago, 26.5 to 19 ka) and the ensuing deglaciation. However, sea-level estimates for the period of ice-sheet growth before the LGM vary by > 60 m, an uncertainty comparable to the sea-level equivalent of the contemporary Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we constrain sea level prior to the LGM by reconstructing the flooding history of the shallow Bering Strait since 46 ka. Using a geochemical proxy of Pacific nutrient input to the Arctic Ocean, we find that the Bering Strait was flooded from the beginning of our records at 46 ka until 35.7 (+3.3 / 2.4)  ka. To match this flooding history, our sea-level model requires an ice history in which over 50% of the LGMs global peak ice volume grew after 46 ka. This finding implies that global ice volume and climate were not linearly coupled during the last ice age, with implications for the controls on each. Moreover, our results shorten the time window between the opening of the Bering Land Bridge and the arrival of humans in the Americas.

Or the Israel way - getting control over it using ground units while risking soldiers to minimize the civilian casualties amount.

Also we have a small water well, that goes a few meters deep, that always delivers ground water.  This was the first summer, where we stopped getting water a few times. Never had that happen before. It was then, when I realized how fucked we are.   The soil has not been the same anymore too. It delivers as usual, but it's not as wet as it was the years before.   It's not much, in the years afterwards, the well gave water as usual, one could say, it was just by chance, but it was not. It was a precursor about what is to come.   The last two years here in Germany more and more villages had to constrain water consumption in the summer.

What do those attacks (which are not nearly as major as they are made out to be--something like 20 Palestinians across 10 years are killed through settler violence, and even those aren't just settlers randomly murdering Palestinians, they are conflicts), have to do with my response? Whatever Palestinians' supposed justifications are, the security concerns remain.  2. Palestine has massive internal divisions, there's no way around it. But I don't think we can reasonably ask Israel to sacrifice its own safety to help Palestine deal with that problem. At this point we can safely conclude that there is 0% chance of Palestinians getting everything they want. It just keeps getting worse and worse for them the longer they refuse to properly negotiate. They need to accept what they can get, and then focus on building their state instead of on trying to get more. This is a bitter pill to swallow for people who believe they have the right to so much more--but the reality of life is that you just don't always get what you want. If the choice you face is less land than you think you deserve, but freedom, on the one hand, versus indefinite conflict on the other hand, the choice should be clear. Israel is not going anywhere, and there is no practical outcome anymore in which they suddenly make massive land concessions for no reason and with high security risk. Especially after they did so with Gaza and we see how that turned out.

I briefly lived in Berkeley and know how off the charts NIMBY it was even in the 80s. I dont think harassing a fellow Democrat off a council would happen in many other places, but Berkeley, and neighboring city areas that have a Berkeley feel, have always been (at least from my POV) a homing ground for vicious, rabid NIMBYs who will attack at the slightest provocation.  And this is not specific to Berkeley, but anywhere that has especially contentious local politics, and we wonder why dont more Democrats run I think that targeted harassment, especially if the politician or candidates school-age children are targeted, is an underrated factor. Which sucks, but how can we tell people its worth maybe getting badly hurt for?  Robinson sounds like he could have gone far. Too bad he wants out so young because hes gotten death threats from NIMBY assholes. (Also this Peoples Park BS has been going on since fucking ever.

First of all, public perception is not the only thing stopping Israel from taking over all of the land -   Israel is surrounded by a ton of countries that would love to destroy them, and if they decided to take over the whole country there is a 0% chance their western allies would get involved in that. They would be on their own. That leaves Israel vulnerable to constant, and probably unified, attacks on them. Israel is strong, sure, but without western backers arming and bank rolling them, they would eventually get over whelmed, or have to resort to their nuclear arsenal which would only get themselves nuked. Obviously this would never happen. Israel is not that stupid.   Second of all, just because the ICJ convicts them of a genocide doesnt mean that the genocide is all of a sudden over. If they made the stupid decision of taking over the whole country after the conviction, that would be a continuation of the same genocide (assuming they continue killing civilians). Look at Myanmar for examplethey were already convicted yet theyre still killing the Rohingya people. The ICJ doesnt have to convict them of a second genocide because they were already convicted.  The ICJ doesnt have any real power to stop genocide, unfortunately. They can only slap on the label.

They select based on who they think will make their lives better.   And right now a lot of those are blaming the post covid economic situation on Biden. Even though it's happening all over the world and the United States isn't doing nearly as badly as a lot of other developed nations.   Biden needs gas prices to stay low and interest rates to decrease a little if he wants to get elected.  Add to that the constant stream of propaganda being fed to young voters via TikTok and shenanigans like the post master general slowing mail in key locations and it's way too close for my fucking comfort.

This war has crossed lines; 10/7 crossed lines. The people accountable are the ministers who ordered the response. They need to be held to account for the war. The same needs to happen to Gaza, the leadership and the people who participated in war crimes need to be prosecuted. That's not saying ALL Gazans are responsible, it's saying the ones that are need to be held accountable.   Gazans are being killed with unacceptable amounts of collateral damage; but we are far away from "massacring." People aren't being the rounded up and shot. Compare this to other massacres, are they the same thing? Do they look similar? No. That doesnt in any way justify the response from attacking on 10/7, which has rendered Gaza nearly uninhabitable.   Hamas isn't an organisation that has ever negotiated in good faith. It's decisions have caused these deaths with Israel being the instrument of destruction. Hamas is a death cult.

Phillips spent way too much time listening to the chicken littles of the world, and thought that "omg we gotta replace Joe nao!!!!" freakout was going to explode.  He thought one of two things would happen:  * someone with clear national support would eventually jump in the race, in which case Phillips would stand aside and encourage his delegates (lol) to vote for them  * no one would ever jump in the race, but the Ezra Klein-type squealing would become so dominant that people would turn to him.  Now, he seemed to understand even at that time he'd likely not have anywhere near the delegates to actually win the nomination.  So his thinking was a Bernie 2016 style appeal for delegates - especially Superdelegates - to overturn the will of the voters and install him as nominee because of polling.    Apparently even Dean has now realized how stupid either scenario really was.  The typical "he was powermad/ trying for VP/ trying to set himself up for Senator/governor/future POTUS run" online takes really miss the mark though (as they usually do).

Most people have faith in institutions of science, justice, and government, they don't know something is true themselves.  Most people hold beliefs about the world even though they have never seen the things they believe for themselves.     I'll give you an example.  The more you learn about a technical field the more you can spot errors on forums and in traditional news that are just wrong.  But people believe them anyways, they are very popular beliefs.  And that's just my field or your field.  If you abstract out this concept, you can see there are probably many fields where people take things on faith.  It's easier to see something like this in retrospect, like the sugar industry lobbying and funding studies to create a belief that fat is bad for you.  I'd also take issue with your idea that religion is supposed to be literally true in the first place.  If someone tells you "be kind to others", is that a factual claim?  There is no fact of the universe that says we should be kind to each other.  That's a moral claim stating that it is good to be kind to others.  Religion as a whole is about telling stories and metaphors to build support for moral claims.  Morality in general is not about whats true but what is advantageous for a group over time.    You could put this in the category of "metaphorically true", contrasted with something being scientifically true.

Not to mention that if Hamas gives away all of its hostages for a temporary ceasefire then what would Israel from carpet bombing Rafah and chasing them to Egypt?

And as expected, Biden never delivered on his promises to the Black community - and even did the opposite considering many issues, like police reform. He constantly sided with the center-right in an attempt to win their votes (and still is), allowed basic rights like abortion to be eroded knowing that they would provide incentive to force votes for establishment Democrats, NEVER seriously went after MAGA and their attempts to destroy the country (once again to create forced incentives, though the last two are an establishment Democrat issue, not necessarily the Biden admins) I mean, Trump is a -stained gun to the head of the country, but Biden and the establishment Democrats are stage 4 cancer

They did it anyways knowing the people there would be angry and retaliate  they felt their cause was more justified than any form of repercussions that come against the people already living there.

The real cost is capital and lead-times required. It's way too expensive to get nuclear projects started ([Illinois EnergyProf has a great video comparing nuclear and natural gas](https://youtu.be/cbeJIwF1pVY), and the payback for solar PV/wind would likely be even quicker). As for lead-times, the anti-nuclear movement/NIMBYism is too strong, and it would probably take 10-15+ years for permitting and constructionwe need to decarbonize our energy grid now. It may work for some nations (e.g. South Korea, China, India) that have access to large amounts of capital, the ability to expedite the process, and a huge energy demand, but I can't see it becoming a wide-spread solution.   In addition, the movement towards environmental justice endorses investment into local, small-scale renewable installations as opposed to mega-projects. I think the best way to decarbonize for most of the developed world will be to over-build smaller-scale renewable capacity, improve the robustness of the existing electrical grid, and build strategic grid interties across provinces/states/nations to improve its reliability and get access to the lowest cost renewable producer.

From what I understand the bombs that they were going to be sending were small-scale (I mean its still a bomb so whatever that means) and were primarily used as like a scare tactic (I fully acknowledge these can still kill people) or to move people from one location to another.

The government's lack of outrage makes it seem like Palestinian lives are a secondary thought.  The "from the river to the sea" thing is a little distasteful for a Congressperson to chant, but Rashida and most of the people chanting it just want to reappropriate it from Hamas into a positive thing.

If you're working for minimum wage, you're likely eating as cheaply as possible. Which typically means calorie-dense and readily available foods - such as dollar-menu cheeseburgers.  Being able to choose to go meatless is a luxury for many. That's why I added the caveat of "if you want to". It probably would have been better to say "if you can afford to", but I digress.   If we're talking purely in hypotheticals, then yes, we should all choose meatless meals. But practically speaking, real life is never so cut-and-dry.  If we want people to switch to vegetarian diets, then instead of pleading for people to make expensive decisions, we should implement financial incentives to eat less meat. Make meat expensive, and heavily subsidize plant-based alternatives.

I would not tax the first $50,000 or so of land value, whatever a person's fair share of land is. Regarding LVT being socialist, I disagree since control of land is in private hands, but this would take away that concern.  I don't think it's possible to tax 100% of land value; theoretically doing so would reduce the sale price of land to zero, and then you wouldn't have a good way to assess land value.  For environmental reasons it is in many cases better to tax the use or depletion of natural resources rather than the possession of them.  So I'd recommend using LVT only as a wealth tax or by cities, not replacing all other taxes.

For millennia after millennia humans didn't cause climate change because we just lived our lives like any other species. That is, try to survive against the elements and procreate. But after 1850 along with industrialisation our mindset has been changed. Everyone from the US president to the Indian president extol the cause of growth in life and prosperity. Actually we all play into the hands of big corporates by doing that. But economic growth and our propensity to prosper is the root cause of climate crisis.  We cannot reduce sale of cars (which is only a small part of the problem) when all of us are told from our childhood that monetary success is paramount and the richest people and their methods of swindle are our role models. Just look at the climate crisis dispassionately and realistically, there is no way we can reverse our march towards the precipice. Even Greta Thunberg, who is so bloody young, says in the latest video that modern lifestyle is not sustainable. But do any of us grown ups want to own up to that statement of fact?

Both are organisations pushing for electrification as a key to decarbonisation. His main point is that many 'machines' in homes and industries use fossil fuels (like water heaters) and we will need to electrify them (and electrify in the most efficient way possible).  If your based in the US it is definitely worth checking out Rewiring America's handbook page. It has a short section on [water heaters](https://www.rewiringamerica.org/electrify-home-guide).  For water heater specifically, the gold standard are heat pump water heaters. They are basically a reverse fridge for water. They only come in storage tank versions, not instant heat versions, so they don't always suit apartments. But for houses they work very well and much more efficiently than a standard electric water heater. They usually come with an instant booster in case you run out of stores hot water. The boosters can be gas or electric.  Here are some [example systems](https://www.rinnai.com.au/hot-water/heat-pump-hot-water/) (on an Australian website).  Heat pump hot water systems are [more expensive on initial purchase l, but are much cheaper to run](https://www.climatechoices.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/1898978/Sustainable-Household-Scheme-A-guide-to-hot-water-heat-pumps.pdf#:~:text=A%20high-quality%20HWHP%20can%20cost%20around%20%245%2C500%20installed%2C,cost%20breakdown%20over%20a%205-%20and%2010-year%20period.)

We can take steps today to make things better without destroying the free market. Start with antitrust enforcement and stop union obstructionists, but also ensure that unions play fairly and don't themselves become corrupt. At times capitalism seems to favor the rich in unfair ways. That is what regulations can correct. Trying to burn the whole house down is a ridiculous idea. Instead continue to create meaningful social policy and programs.

It was never said in tv, only in pg13+ movies, and I dont recall it being said after about 2008. Tropic Thunder really stands out as the last time I heard it.

Also, the early 2000s were an absolute hellscape (personal opinion). Mental healthcare sucked, clothes were uncomfortable, the internet was slow and clunky, and the societal expectations on women were unbearable. You should look at pictures of fat celebrities then vs healthy celebrities now. Specifically, look into Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton.   I cannot stress enough that we have much more nuanced conversations around health, work boundaries, life expectations, family life, mental health, etc today.   Now, the capitalistic hellscape we live in has been declining steadily for generations.

It's hard to tell really, we'll have to take into account that no civilians have evacuated yet and are still going about their day normally, which is something I didn't consider in my original post which probably makes some difference.  But I guess if we use the same 5% standred, that's around 150 failed rockets, and I guess it would mean around 750 deaths at an average of 5 deaths per rocket?   It seems unlikely to be fair, but airstrikes did start very shortly afterwards and I doubt reporters on ground will be able to tell much of a difference between an airstrike and a failed rocket.   You raised a pretty good question though, it would really depend if there was a difference in rocket failures between the start of the war and the middle of the war and if the conditions on the ground made it more likely for civilians to be hurt by misfired rockets.

That being said there *are* legitimate criticisms or errors which other fields have found in her work- a frequent one is that the mechanism which allows methane to diffuse from the seabed into the water column in the ESAS (or, really, any place where clathrates are known to exist) - is blocked via poor thermal conduction of the main sediment layer.

Historical spatial variations in surface temperature anomalies are derived from historical weather station data and ocean data from ships, buoys and other sensors. Uncertainties arise from measurement uncertainty, changes in spatial coverage of the station record, and systematic biases due to technology shifts and land cover changes. Previously published uncertainty estimates for GISTEMP included only the effect of incomplete station coverage. Here, we update this term using currently available spatial distributions of source data, stateoftheart reanalyses and incorporate independently derived estimates for ocean data processing, station homogenization and other structural biases. The resulting 95% uncertainties are near 0.05 C in the global annual mean for the last 50 years, and increase going back further in time reaching 0.15 C in 1880. In addition, we quantify the benefits and inherent uncertainty due to the GISTEMP interpolation and averaging method. We use the total uncertainties to estimate the probability for each record year in the GISTEMP to actually be the true record year (to that date), and conclude with 86% likelihood that 2016 was indeed the hottest year of the instrumental period (so far).

I definitely see your point about it being used by the right-wing to prevent progress, but I think it's a double edged sword that could easily cut against other minority interests that are important.  Different states have different industries and the impact of a policy might not be felt at all in one state while it is devastating to another.  Likewise it would consolidate power to cities and the needs of certain rural areas could be neglected.  Ultimately I'm not against making things more proportional, and I'm definitely not a fan of a tiny minority being able to halt everything, but I still think there's a bit of a balance that could be struck and if we had less extreme politics, then not only would we not have to worry as much about obstructionists, we'd have more durable results whenever we do achieve progress.

I don't understand how one could be friends with someone so insufferable.  Like...there's no logic to be used in response to that, I wouldn't even know how to debate it, all you can do is laugh and mock. If I came up to you and said "watermelons are an instrument of White Genocide," would you spend hours trying to assuage your guilt and trying to make sure that you weren't genocidal, or would you just laugh? It's not really a position that can be debated.  I know Leftism says otherwise, but you don't *have* to get on your knees and beg and listen and check your privilege every time some aggrieved minority has something to gripe about. You do not owe them anything. If "reason" is sexist then okay cool, guess we better all be sexists now. Stop giving these "-ist" and "-phobe" words so much power over you - if you just shrug and say "okay, if that opinion makes me 'racist'/'sexist' to you then cool, I'm not sure why I'd care about that" they lose all their sting.  If women don't like being corrected they could try not saying insane wrong things, that might help.

Had he sold property in order to appeal, then won the appeal (which everyone knows he will), NY state would have been sued for irreparable harm as a result of the erroneous and malicious judgement you need to pay the penalty prior to appealing.  The irreparable harm is the fact that trump would have lost property and not been able to get it back again at the same price he sold it for. It would be much more expensive.   It would have been a huge payday for Trump against any taxpayers as a result of corrupt James and the judge. It may even still be depends how he came up with the liquidity.

It basically just means that any good and services the government has received must be paid for. A new president, for example, can't just say "tough shit, we are the government" and not pay what is owed. Congress can't refuse to pay out previously issued bonds (a particular concern post civil war). We can argue all we want about where and how to spend money, but once it is spent, it can't be questioned.  The problem with the Supreme Court overturning a last-minute invocation of the 14th is some of the money will already be gone. Paychecks will be issued. There is no mechanism for the courts clawing that money back and the damage of tens of thousands of federal paychecks bouncing would be catastrophic. The court can say what they want, but they can't unfuck that pig.

But I say yes, because it seems (and this is just my opinion) that climate change MAY have the ability to alter the relationships between different mechanisms/oscillations/patterns....and i think that screws up not only statistical models but it might screw up dynamical models (they are built during a climate period that no longer is representative of the current climate) too.    but just my thoughts and feelings

It was a self-defensive attack on behalf of the people.  The aggressor was Israel in the beginning of the year when they kidnapped hundreds of Palestinian children and kept them in detainment and did not allow the parents or even the parents lawyers to negotiate for their release. So Hamas was forced to mount a prison break. And some soldiers were tasked with plan B to collect military hostages and get back to base in the event that plan A (jailbreak and release of the detainees in the Israeli detainment center) failed, they could then, use the hostages, to negotiate a hostage swap.

All of these tend to fail because there's an orchestration problem in society. Concentrated wealth and power have less to orchestrate and can therefor come to a consensus and act more quickly. Developing efficient organization and follow through processes, if they even exist, is the critical missing step, in my opinion.   The process that typically causes this is some huge social unrest like strife, famine, etc that unites people to the point of pitchforks and torches.

For an untold number of years there has been a belief that women are too emotional to participate in politics.  Historically that belief was applied to women voting and was cited as a reason they shouldn't be able to vote.  This belief has largely lived on in right-wing circles and applies not only to voting but also to holding public office, especially the POTUS.  You will still regularly hear tropes from the right that a woman president will, 'start a war just because she's on her period.'  Even many right-wing women hold this view and will say that they themselves shouldn't be able to vote because women aren't to be trusted with such a serious undertaking.   Katie Britt's speech last night only helped to further this outdated and stupid belief.  The setting of a fake kitchen helping to push the imagery that it is there where women belong and her going through a littany of exaggerated emotions helping to confirm the belief that women are 'fragile,' and too emotional for politics.    It's really amazing how far back into time the GOP wants to push this country in every single way, and IMO, this was pretty much another attempt at that goal and one that will resonate with at least a part of their base if not more.

If/when all cars go electric, it might make sense in certain areas to power a more robust grid with some small amount of fossil fuels, or have them available as a backup system for grid integrity.

Then, I had this feeling, like I needed to d word dive because I truly didnt know what the fuck to think anymore. I watched the footage, the full footage, that had been clipped to sway the masses into thinking this way, but the parts that were cut also provided context. The same clips that infuriated me had a whole story behind them that included conxerns about the children that have been trafficked at the hands of our government and the absolutely explosive numbers of people dying because of the drugs being illegally imported into our country (our govt is totally involved, as I think we all know now) but that was incredibly eye opening to me.

But beyond the racial issues, removing the right to vote is one more obstacle (in a line of obstacles) for criminals to reintegrate into society. I think its possible to make a terrible mistake and then learn and change. Isnt that the very message Christianity preaches?

Russia's is likely somewhat worse than it appeared since they've been making up their demographic data for 20 years and the demographic data prior to that also wasn't particularly good (I suspect they've got 5-10 million fewer people than they think they do & half of those would be under 25), but Ukraine also has the echo effects of Holodomor so their known demographic pinch is a bit deeper and longer.  One of the reasons Ukraine's conscription was originally 27+ and was just lowered to 25+ was to help protect the lives of people who are younger & therefore more likely to have more kids if they live through the war.  A big issue for both counties is that this war is hitting that *already* smaller demographic that's the echo of WWII.   The big post-war difference is probably going to be that Ukraine will likely have some foreign fighters decide to stay & put down roots, many of the most recent refugee diaspora will likely return, and we'll probably see some people from other parts of the world move to a rebuilding Ukraine to be part of that project.  Russia is going to have none of that.

Exposure of the Sahul shelf excites a positive ocean-atmosphere feedback involving a stronger surface temperature gradient along the equatorial Indian Ocean and a weaker Walker circulationa response explaining the drier/wetter dipole across the basin. Northern Hemisphere cooling by ice sheet albedo drives a monsoonal retreat across Africa and the Arabian Peninsulaa response that triggers a weakening of the Indian monsoon via cooling of the Arabian Sea and associated reductions in moisture supply. These results demonstrate the importance of air-sea interactions in the Indian Ocean, amplifying externally forced climate changes over a large part of the tropics.

However I attribute it to lack of education and exposure to moderate Jews. I am blessed to have the opportunity to travel overseas, meet many Jewish people I now call friends, see how Jewish and Muslim communities co-exist peacefully all over the world. Most people here do not have that opportunity and are only exposed to Judaism during the conflicts in Palestine. When you're only exposed to that side of Israel, you will eventually go down the road of antisemitism.   This is why, while everyone here is sharing footages of dead Palestinian children and insensitive IDF war crime videos (which are completely valid and should be exposed), I tend to share more coverage of Breaking the Silence, the ideological divide between older generation and younger generation of Jews, footage of Jewish protests against Israel and outlets that speak out against Israeli occupation like Haaretz and BTselem.

Excellent question that has bothered me for many decades. Why? Because an increase of just 100ppm CO2 (180-280ppm), from the peak of the last glacial maximum \~20,000 years ago to the "climate optimum" reached about ten-thousand years ago, produced a temperature rise of \~5-degree C.  We have now increased it by an additional 135ppm (280-415ppm). So, where is the heat? Delayed? Poor isotope proxy choices for temps? If so we are in for a very hot time, and current "sensitivity" values are far from correct and questionable.  I'd like to hear answers to this riddle.

This study reconstructs the history of sea level at the Bering Strait by tracing the influence of Pacific waters in the Arctic Ocean. We find that the Bering Strait was open from at least 46,000 until 35,700 y ago, thus dating the last formation of the land bridge to within 10,000 y of the LGM. This history requires that ice volume increased rapidly into the LGM. In addition, it appears that humans migrated to the Americas as soon as the formation of the land bridge allowed for their passage.  **Abstract**  The cyclic growth and decay of continental ice sheets can be reconstructed from the history of global sea level. Sea level is relatively well constrained for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26,500 to 19,000 y ago, 26.5 to 19 ka) and the ensuing deglaciation. However, sea-level estimates for the period of ice-sheet growth before the LGM vary by > 60 m, an uncertainty comparable to the sea-level equivalent of the contemporary Antarctic Ice Sheet. Here, we constrain sea level prior to the LGM by reconstructing the flooding history of the shallow Bering Strait since 46 ka. Using a geochemical proxy of Pacific nutrient input to the Arctic Ocean, we find that the Bering Strait was flooded from the beginning of our records at 46 ka until 35.7 (+3.3 / 2.4 ka). To match this flooding history, our sea-level model requires an ice history in which over 50% of the LGMs global peak ice volume grew after 46 ka. This finding implies that global ice volume and climate were not linearly coupled during the last ice age, with implications for the controls on each. Moreover, our results shorten the time window between the opening of the Bering Land Bridge and the arrival of humans in the Americas.

The reason this is being drawn out so long is because people are being incredibly naive and fooling themselves into thinking that Hamas and other terrorists are rational adults that listen to reason. They ignore that Hamas openly lies and admits that they lie in order to achieve their goals. The only thing they respect or obey is brute force, anything else is weakness to them. Israel is foolish to even try to negotiate with them.  Destroying their infrastructure tunnels aka their headquarters, weapons cache, and their route to smuggling weapons is the reason Hamas is losing all their power pretty rapidly. They'll never be able to rebuild anything remotely similar. It obviously took an enormous amount of money, labor, equipment, planning and time to build it in the first place.  They're running out of places to hide, and it's harder for them to use as cover that they're just civilians. They have so much Intel on Hamas now they know who they're going after and where they're at. It's also pretty obvious now many of these so-called civilians are actually collaborating with them. Of course you'll never hear that from the BBC or from Al Jazeera since they count Hamas and their terrorist associates deaths as civilians.

Its also been pretty agreed upon by analysts the idea of Ukraine concentrating its forces into one or two main attacks would have been really bad. Its like the experiences at Mala Tokmachka was memory holed by whatever anonymous officials complain about this lack of focus. That suggestion is just cope to deflect from the American side of failures in why this counteroffensive didnt go far and put the failure squarely on Ukraines shoulders (and yes I acknowledge that Ukraine does shoulder much if not a majority of the blame, but the US is not exempt from this blame as these anonymous officials like to insinuate)

And so far Hamas  were right - it got put on the agenda again and the entire planet talks about plus they managed to expose Israels barbarity to the rest of the world, something that had been kept hidden for decades.

We get it, it's their land Israel shouldn't exist in the first place etc but pragmatically what is to be done? They have not managed to organize a non terrorist non combative government (PA is a whole different can of worms but also supports terrorism and denies Israels right to exist) with which any peace deals can be made in the foreseeable future and the territory is effectively a collapsed war zone. Anyone who wants to stay for nationalist reasons could do that but if Saudi Arabia and Congo want to open up programs to voluntarily allow refugees of the Gaza conflict the option of relocating that is a good thing. No one wants to help them by opening their doors bc they are afraid of how radicalized they are and some Arab countries see them as pawns in their game of chess against Israel and the US. but let's let them have some agency and decide what they'd rather do.

There have been countless cases of Palestinians being killed or abused in this conflict despite posing no threat, there just has been no investigations into them because the only people who could investigate are the same ones killing them. In fact there have been many cases of Israeli soldiers/terrorists killing unarmed Palestinian civilians and getting away with it before this conflict and before Israel was even created. Even when there is no wars going on, IDF soldiers get away with murder/abuse or are given extremely short sentences.  Look up the Qassim massacre where an Israeli soldier killed 40 Palestinian civilians for breaking a curfew they were unaware of. He spent 3 years in jail. That's less than a month for each person he killed. It is Israeli policy that those who kill Palestinian civilians don't face proper consequences (normally face no consequences at all) for it. Even in cases where justice has been served like when an Israeli settler got a life sentence for burning a family to death including a baby, he managed to get $300K dollars for it.  "What happened is horrific for everybody, including the hostages, their families, the soldiers, their families and the IDF command involved. Making anything else out of this is pure propaganda."  Oh I'm spitting propoganda and don't care about the families. I AM LITERALLY REPEATING WHAT THE FATHER OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS SAID. No I am not a soldier but the father was a soldier and so was his son who got killed by the IDF. This whole argument of 'your not a soldier you don't know what it's like' is redicilous denialism. Many military experts, historians, politicians etc. (you know the people that we trust to analyse conflicts) were never soldiers either.

In fact back in 2001, America was in such a good book that even Kuwaiti queue up to donate blood to help the victims of 9/11.

Many innocent people were killed, people including foreigners here held hostage in a luxury hotel. India did not immediately bomb Pakistan.

I would also like to acknowledge that the barbaric nature of the October 7th terror attacks are horrific beyond comparison.   3.

American took ten days to grief, drum up support from Americans and the entire world even support from China, Russia, Europe, the Arab world, etc invoked article 5 of NATO, received the mandate from the UN and the world for war on terror, a just war, formed a coalition of a willing.

Second, I do not see how you square your beliefs about individual liberty with the conservative bent towards controlling people's sexuality, unless they are informed by your religion. Which is perfectly fine, it is imposing those religious values on others that is problematic.  I guess my question to you would be what things, besides the collectiveness of big government and taxation, do you feel liberals impose upon peoples personal lives similarly to say the conservative anti LGBTQ stance? And why is one worse or better than the other?

Do you want access to already completed model simulations (model output) or do you want to run your own model simulations? First, I would come up with a hypothesis and research question, then test your hypothesis with historical observations. You can easily download NCEP, JMA, or ERA5 data by making an account with those agencies. Youll have to analyze your data with a language like Python, NCL, etc. That in itself is not trivial and people do graduate degrees to learn how to do such research. Once you complete a historical observation study, then to strengthen your research results, you may want to run a simulation or analyze previously ran simulations.

And the risks are  A) Turn the right into martyrs  B) Provoke a backlash in general  C) Entrench those officials in their own beliefs as is.  My big issue is that there's no limiting principle on this once you start harassing public officials and not protesting their general actions. Should resturants exclude them? Grocery stores? Dry cleaners? Bowling alleys? For the protesters, the goal seems to be to shut them out of public life completely, which I think would only fracture our society politically even more.

Its Zionism in practice, however, that turned into Jewish migrants claims to the land that is now Israel coming at the expense of the people already living there. And then the occupation in the WB and the siege of Gaza. Whether or not you think these policies are justified, you cannot separate them from Zionism as a political movement. So what would be the appropriate term for people who acknowledge that Jews ties to the land go back thousands of years and support Jews living in the Holy Land, but are against the policies Israel has put in place to retain control of all of the land at the expense of the other people with legitimate claims to it as well? I ask this question honestly, as this accurately describes my position and I fail to see how this could be antisemitic, but in recent days Ive been told that it is.  There are, of course, flagrant antisemites who might try to claim that theyre anti-Zionist because its more palatable, but theyre not fooling anyone.

Trump's actions, and his followers' response to them, are consistent with the "forgiveness" inherent in Christianity.   They'll let you off the hook for almost anything, theologically. The followers are more than happy to believe he's being "forgiven' by the Almighty and that he's a suitable leader because of his human foibles.  No thanks.

Both of those are problems, and problems that need to be spoken out against.  Burning wood is "technically" seen as "clean" because we regrow the trees, and trees take in CO2. It's not actually clean because of what you mentioned. The trees are burned and release the CO2 anyway.  With the banning of smelting, Canada is basically trying to make itself look good while moving the blame to a country that is willing to take that blame - Mexico. You could argue whether Canada is intentionally doing this, or whether it is the companies moving their production to get around the ban; the results are the same. It's just moving numbers around and pretending like things are being done. It's a major problem.

You wouldnt even make that work in a ancient and medieval state. In reality, civilization requires specializations that create non-Proletariats, people who oversee people and things, but do not labor. The King working in the fields, or the President working in the factory, is a mirage. Advanced economies simply need people whose work is overseeing and directing the means of production and those who use them. The correct system is one where the wise, competent, and genuinely good oversee those who are less wise, competent, and virtuous, demoting people based on their lack of prudence, incompetence, and selfishness, and promoting people based on their wisdom, skill, and service and felt vocation to the common good.  I know this system isnt capitalism, but it is definitely not the socialism you are describing either.

By Law Japan requires "Society" to ensure that every child between 6-15 is fully covered with a complete education. The focus is on exposure to a wide array of subjects early on to promote the child's interest in different subjects, as well as demonstrating to the child that the system is beneficial to them.  This happens until after middle school and when that child is 15 they make a choice to continue on to high school or to "make it on their own" and not educate themselves further to join the work force.   96% of students not only choose to continue to go on to High school, they also choose to go to what are known as "Cram schools" which is a full school day following the first with supplementary and extra curricular courses. They have an incredible selection of topics that cover almost anything you could want to study.  The school day for these students starts at 8am on average, and they choose to go to another full day of school ending there day at 10pm or later. Again, this is all by choice.  From their the students enter the work force, or enter University. The culture of education sees the conversion mainly go to university where they can specialize further.  The entire process takes 16 years on average having a university educated citizen in the work force by 22 done almost entirely by choice with every opportunity to leave. Yet they choose to not only do it, but choose to do it extremely well and with purpose.  All of this is done spending around $13,000 USD annually per full time student. Yes, that money is start to finish. They still have service workers and a wide variety of shops and activities fully staffed.  You treat education as something a majority does not want and would not benefit from because they are a Janitor, yet Japan demonstrates you aren't only wrong but defending a terrible system that creates a culture against a good education.  The world is much bigger than the US and many countries are doing much better than the US in numerous areas. That is what happens when you offshore production, devalue education, and glorify the pursuit of money over all else.  The USA can still correct course, as can every one else under performing, and I maintain it would be to the net benefit of the population as demonstrated by Japans culture of education and the positive outcomes from it.

The fact that you take his word so seriously when he's been wrong multiple times is quite frankly, astounding.   I only know of one of his predictions, but I may be wrong. And ai don't care about his predictions, I care about his years of expertise.   >The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Just because someone criticizes it does not make it true.   >https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/arctic-will-be-ice-free-in-summer-next-year-robin-mckie-peter-wadhams-the-guardian/  But we know that the IPCC is too conservative on this front.

They use the RCPs in their own models, adding to the system, rather than just using the standard IPCC ones.  >Very interesting from someone who's main source of information is Wadhams. And for the record Wadhams does know what he's talking about generally, but the claims he makes in big media are never supported and the fact that you put so much faith in him is strange and almost makes me ignore your opinion entirely.   So my approval of Wadhams disproved everything I have to say?   Read his papers, you will see that he is the expert, if your knowledge of Wadhams comes from the media:  "  >almost makes me ignore your opinion entirely.   "  >And if you'd go through u/ClimateNurse's page you'd know that the IPCC actually does include a lot of feedback loops, maybe not directly in the models but certainly in the literature especially when talking about the RCP scenarios.   But the models are the most important, and even then, they don't include all the feedbacks, and they downplay them.   >And I hate to break it to you, but even with methane permafrost release it doesn't go up by that much. More and more studies are popping up about it and the methane permafrost is not that bad when you consider that; when it melts its environment is a carbon sink in some places, methane's short lifespan (never reaching it's full potential), and that it likely won't actually effect warming much until after 2100. So basically many of these feedback loops we're seeing are more important for ECS than near term warming.  Read Shakhova et Al 2013.  >Now if we're talking the 1% rule, there's a reason not many scientists are not as alarmed as you about it, but you choose to cherry pick the ones that are... Which makes your motives questionable imo. You sorta pick and play at it like it's inevitable so you can "criticize" the IPCC and feel smart or something, idk.  Read Shakhova et Al 2013, up to 3% is vulnerable.  >And on another note I really dislike how you're patronizing the user while simultaneously propping yourself up on a high horse in the last paragraph. Speaks volumes.  Was I patronising? I was telling a layman how to access climate science.

(Paraphrase from memory, spoilers for Night Watch);  ----  Thugs were common. They did violence because it filled their wallets or because they enjoyed it. They took a direct approach and were simple enough to understand. Captain Swing was the other sort. He was a man who, one day while out on patrol, had something inside of him snap, and when he got back to headquarters had sat calmly at his desk, taken out a quill, and set about writing a *justification* for thuggery. By traveling the scenic route to the same destination, he inspired a quiet fear and awe from the common thug, because reason had created means of brutality that unreason quaked to behold.  ---  (Swing is the leader of the secret police in ankh-morpork, who utilizes dictatorial tactics to enforce terror and order on the population. The Cable Street Particulars ("There is no police station on cable street") are some of the antagonists of the book. Also note; Cable street, in reference to Mosley and his fascists. His name is a reference to mob violence, and death threats to officials used to be signed "Captain Swing" in the UK).

But it's somewhat disturbing to me that you feel the need to clarify it.     Incel started off meaning involuntary celibate.   Meaning a guy who just really can't seem to make it work with a  sex partner.  Back in my day we used to call these guys dorks,  nerds,  etc.    There usually was somewhat of an unspoken understanding that these were the guys who didn't PEAK in high school or their younger years,  and would be the "guy at the reunion with tons of money,  a huge house and a hot wife."     It was never equivocated with violence.  &#x200B;  I have raised three sons  and I can tell you IMO that violent incels are a result of being violent and cynical and mean in the first place.     One of my sons, unfortunately,  has been this way.  He's aggressive when confronted on lies and usually has some sort of con going on.    I also saw this type of behavior with my brother btw.     The other two  (touch wood)   are not only NOT violent,  they go out of their way to control their temper and at most might get in a screaming match with a woman.    But they would never (touch wood)  lay their hand on her.    IMO this demostrates that being an incel is not what leads to violent outbursts from which they need to be SAVED.   It's the other way around.     Some guys wind up as an incel because they are not attractive.   Some are shy and have a crappy personality.    But SOME guys wind up as an incel because they are narcissistic and entitled and it turns partners WAY OFF.      My own son has on numerous occasions stated how girls are so lucky to have him.   Yet he keeps getting dumped and even more important,  as he gets older the age of the girls he can get to date him goes down.  So he's stuck dating 18 year olds even though he's 30.   Why?  Because women his own age can see right through his BS and younger women don't.     So,  if this post was about changing your own view of yourself,  I hope that you can see that the incel is not "prone to violence'    but violent asshole narcissists are often rejected by women because of their inherent violent attitude towards the world.    If you are not this kind of incel,  you have nothing to worry about.  Your autism has nothing to do with it.

The Palestinian Arab population has been growing rapidly, and even after Arafat launched his terror war in 2000, 90% of the Palestinian Arabs (referring here to those who are not Arab Israelis, as they have full and equal rights within the State of Israel) were governed by the Palestinian Authority. They were offered their own state in 1947, 2000 and 2008, and refused it each time because it would have required accepting living in peace alongside the Jewish state.  Some 25,000 Arabs died in their failed attempt to genocide the Jews in 1947-8. Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, declared in 1947 that, were a war to take place with the proposed establishment of a Jewish state, it would lead to "a war of extermination and momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacre and the Crusades.

That woman has accused at least 5 different men of sexually assaulting her. She couldnt remember exactly when it happened, her story of where it happened was completely unbelievable, the dress she says she was wearing and says she still owns wasnt even made until a decade after the timeline she gives for the assault and now she says gleefully that shes going shopping as the first thing to do with the money. That is totally how sexual assault victims act, absolutely. Smiling and laughing and making jokes on national TV.  Not to mention $83 million? Thats insane.  Plus, the entire defamation case was based on Trump essentially denying the allegation and because of it her book belonged in the fiction section. That was deemed enough to warrant an $83 million dollar payday.  Edit : Not to mention, in a civil case like this it comes down to who the Jury will believe, because there is zero evidence that anything happened.. Of course a Manhattan jury made up of all Democrats, most of which likely despise Trump but would lie through their teeth during jury selection for the chance to stick it to Trump, is incapable of being impartial. The case should have been moved to Suffolk County, Long Island where they could at least get some mix of different views on the jury.

The real danger, is the reality of homegrown terrorism from the extreme right.  Timothy McVay and the Oklahoma City bombing come to mind.  One of the more recent shootings (the grocery store I believe) was a right winger afraid of replacement theory.  Were going to see an uptick in this type of violence, with perhaps a smattering of isolated Cliven Bundy type militia confrontations.   But enough of this type of violence can slowly disrupt society enough to do real damage.  I dont think were gonna see an actual civil war, but theres a threat of serious destabilizing violence.

It's nowhere to be found in the 2A. The interpretation that it does was only ruled in, what, 2003?  Which is interesting, considering our now conservative-majority Supreme Court seems to like ruling based on constitutional fundamentalism, i.e. precedents should be ruled on based on the literal historical context of the text, and/or influenced by long-standing traditions of societal norms. It's the argument they used to break apart Roe v. Wade, after all.  Would love to see someone challenge the Heller ruling and get it to the SC, to see just how consistent they are in those "fundamentalist" interpretations. Considering, of course, the "right to be armed for purposes of self defense" has absolutely no historical tradition or societal norms to harken to...all except over these last 20+ years.  In fact, the SC in the 30's ruled in a way that set a precedent the current makeup of the SC *should* interpret as the long-standing tradition of the 2A specifically *not applying* to self-defense as a reason for bearing arms. Considering before that, and for the 70 or so years after the ruling, the 2A was not interpreted in any way, shape or form to give individual citizens the right to bear arms for the purpose of self-defense against other citizens.

I believe it's important to note that in America, we don't have a healthcare problem- our healthcare is great and we have some of the best doctors, medical schools, and healthcare institutions in the world. We have a health insurance problem- health insurance is broken and expensive encouraging most young people not to pay in, small businesses to not offer health insurance plans, and for individuals and families to forego utilization which often times results in greater expenses later on- as well as many going without insurance at all.  What I would suggest is that Medicare pay for emergencies, hospital stays, and surgeries. All other services will be paid for by private insurance with healthcare vouchers being provided to cover the cost of premiums up to the state avg. I would want everyone to have a personal interest beating health savings account funded by a personal income tax equivalent to 8% of state living wage (Here in Texas that would come out to a savings of $1,995). These HSAs can be used to meet deductibles and copaymenys. Those making below living wage (Here in Texas that's about $24,400 for a single person) will be given a health savings subsidy up to that 8% living wage mark.  OR   Turn Medicare into a universal system that covers up to certain limits, combined with the aforementioned health savings account and private insurance.  Up to 90% for surgeries, emergencies, and hospital stays Up to 75% for prescriptions Up to 60% for doctors visits  With private insurance paying the rest

The CSIRO suggests that theres limited utility in seeding over the majority of the country. So it does seem fairly rare to me, but if you disagree thats fine. Everyone has different standards regarding this stuff.  As for tracking CO2 from human emissions, we can actually track that to an extent. Thanks to the fact it is underground for long periods of time, the Carbon atoms in coal and oil undergo decay. This leads to a lack of Carbon 14 isotopes in fossil fuels. Once we burn this fuel, it changes the isotopic ratio present in the atmosphere ie. less Carbon 14 when compared to regular atmospheric Carbon atoms. So we can tell roughly how much CO2 we are emitting. As it becomes well-mixed in the atmosphere, it becomes irrelevant where the actual source comes from. It is more important that we know what acts as an emitter.

You wouldnt even make that work in a ancient and medieval state. In reality, civilization requires specializations that create non-Proletariats, people who oversee people and things, but do not labor. The King working in the fields, or the President working in the factory, is a mirage. Advanced economies simply need people whose work is overseeing and directing the means of production and those who use them. The correct system is one where the wise, competent, and genuinely good oversee those who are less wise, competent, and virtuous, demoting people based on their lack of prudence, incompetence, and selfishness, and promoting people based on their wisdom, skill, and service and felt vocation to the common good.

While ultimately we can expect renewable energy to make us even less reliant on foreign resources, the fact that the US is pumping so much oil is absolutely having an effect on how salient the Middle East is to the US' interests. We would've never stopped drone striking Yemen in 2021 if we were still desperately reliant on Middle Eastern oil, and we would've never been able to coordinate a global effort to force drastic cuts on the profit margins and production of Russian oil and gas.  Ultimately, climate change does mean that the US needs to transition to cleaner energy sources, but in the mean time, US energy production is already at a point where it's paying off big time in terms of foreign policy, meaning less appetite or impetus for Middle Eastern conflicts and better focus on different geopolitical hot spots that are important to US national security.

Ill try.  Consider why the US isnt predominantly using metric measurements, or for that matter, why a UK fluid ounce is a different volume than a US fluid ounce. Its not because people dont communicate or just like to be stubborn, its because retooling everything based on those measurements is prohibitively expensive and disruptive. At this point, its the sort of thing that could put a lot of manufacturers out of business.  Now, think about insisting every manufacturer suddenly go green. Well, aside from the prohibitive cost of retooling, we also have to be very clear about what green is AND we have to all agree to do it. By all, that includes countries like China who would happily not go green in order to undercut the price of their competitors and countries that do operate globally but have high levels of corruption. Do you punish/exclude entire nations for not meeting an agreed standard or let them undercut the world on price while decimating their own land? What about countries that are so underdeveloped that they couldnt possibly meet such standards? Do they simply get overlooked?  And then, if you could get the world to agree on that, which manufactures do you let fail because they cant afford the transition? What jobs do you sacrifice? Who do you let go hungry? And what about the supply chain disruption that happens in the meantime? What goods would such a massive immediate change impact?  You cant just want something, you have to make sacrifices to get it, even if its right for the planet. This kind of change requires global sacrifice and participation. We cant even agree to not try and reclaim old lands (Russia:Ukraine, China/Taiwan).   This is a very complex problem.

Some say it goes back to Sir Francis Bacon, top advisor to King James I.  Bacon drew-out a plan to develop the newly colonized North America into a utopia.  By some accounts, the Masons extend back to Bacon and beyond, some claim as far as the Knights Templar.  Though the name Freemason wasn't actually adopted until the early 1700's.  Now, here's something kept hidden about their history.  The Masons appear to have splintered into two groups around the time of the American Revolution.  Prior to American independence, the Masons in the American colonies were still cordial with the Masons in England.  But as the American colonies grew richer, the Masons born and raised in the New World resented having to take orders from England, and of course, resented sending a lot of wealth back to the English king.  So the American Masons, which included Washington, Franklin, and the rest of the Founding Fathers, decided they would break away from the English Masons, both politically and ideologically.  So not only did the colonies break away from England, but the US Masons broke away from the English Masons.  Following the US revolution, the American Masons took their anti-monarchy campaign around the world, helping the French Masons overthrow their monarchy.  The two monarchies of England and France stuck together (let's call them the monarchist-Masons, while the break-away Masons of the US and France stuck together (let's call them the break-away-Masons).  The break-away Masons then helped other countries break away for their monarchies, helping two prominent South American Masons revolt against the monarchy of Spain, they being:  Jos de San Martn of Argentina, who lead the revolutions against Spanish rule in Argentina (1812), Chile (1818), and Peru (1821), and  Simon Bolivar of Venezuela, who successfully liberated New Granada (Colombia and Panama), Venezuela, and Quito (Ecuador) between 1819 and 1822.  So by that time, the two Mason groups were composed of the monarchies of Europe on the one side, and the newly freed nations of both Americas and France.  It is believed that these two Mason groups have continually been opposed to each other in many ways.  It is believed the English Masons helped the northern states in the US civil war.  John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Lincoln, was a southern Freemason.  It is also believed the modern Democrat Masons have closer ties to English Masons than the Republican Masons do.  Interestingly, a few years ago, while he was still Prince Charles of England (now King Charles III), had a meeting with Trump in which Charles flatly told Trump to smarten-up on how he was leading the US at the time.  Trump is a high-ranking member of the US Mason group, and it appears they are still at odds with English masonry.  There is so much that can be said about them.  The problem is they are so secretive about things that it's tough to get an accurate picture of their rivalry.

Republicans have two paths to success. They can either try to appeal to the general public and win over a majority of the population.  Or they work the electoral college and gerrymanded house districts to win with a smaller number of votes. This way they don't have to win over 50.1% of the population, they just need like 47%.  They have leaned hard into option 2 and they appeal directly to that base which is largely rural and conservative.  Democrats only have one path to success, getting a large majority. Their base is largely urban and there underrepresented in government, so its not sufficient to merely win a majority, they need to win a large majority to win at all. So they have build as large a coalition as possible to win. But you can't promise everything to everyone and so the bigger coalition you build the more bland you get since you have to reduce the potential for infighting.   The other half of it is that the freedom caucus is crazy on a level that democrats aren't. Given the choice between achieving something or nothing, most democrats want to do something. This leaves the moderates with a lot of leverage over what gets passed. The freedom caucus has repeatedly stated that they would rather the government default on its debt than pass a spending bill without deep deep cuts to social spending and they do not fear the fallout of a government shutdown. So they get pull this shit constantly.  Note that this method hasn't actually given them many policy victories. The more moderate Republicans will only bend so much. This current congress has only passed 34 bills total. That abysmal. But again, hardcore republicans want to government to fail and by disfunctional, so they get what they want either way.  Democrats have an entirely different dynamic. If they took hardline stances like Republicans have, the result would likely be the same, congress would simply not pass anything. But democrats in congress would not be content with that outcome in the way that Republicans are.

My first stance is that the government should have no say in what you do with your body, or who you marry. Personal duty to your neighbors, and morality would be more of a social issue. Society as a whole would be better if we promoted a set of values that society *should* follow, but not necessarily obligated or mandated to follow.   I think society would benefit from coming to a general consensus between right and wrong, despite our religious or moral convictions. As a Christian, Im able to say its objectively ok for a woman to have an abortion if her life is in danger. However, I dont think it should be socially acceptable to abort a baby just because you have a creampie kink and accidentally got pregnant. Women who brag about how many abortions theyve had are morally reprehensible to me, and I think it should be ok for them to experience shame on a societal level.   How do we enforce this societal model, and where would it come from? I dont know. I personally adhere to the golden rule, but thats just me.

This source should make a lot clear: [tree of life](https://www.evogeneao.com/explore/tree-of-life-explorer). Tldr: for a long time in earths history (from 4000 million years ago to 1500 million years ago) as you also claim, the earths atmosphere was full of co2, nitrogen, methane etc, and a lot of life forms existed, but these are bacteria, archaea, and protists. So yes there was some biodiversity, but is this relevant to current life? Not really.   Only after this plants evolved and added oxygen to the atmosphere which made it possible for current life to exist. This cut from the same data shows the life that is relevant to us, starting from about 700 million years ago: [history of life](https://i.imgur.com/RkuY1SS.png)...  But i think your first couple of points have to do with biodiversity and not really with climate change. I think nobody is arguing that CO2 is some kind of monster gas that is killing us all, we even breathe it out ourselves. The problem is that in the current atmosphere, we have a delicate balance where co2 regulates how warm the planet is (like a gas blanket) through radiative forcing of sun rays, and that balance is very fast being tipped towards a situation where we wont be able to live in the comfort we have for the past (ten?) thousand years orso, because 9f the industrial emission of CO2.

You do realise, dont you, that in Roman times, when the earths population was but a tiny fraction of what it is now, people were successfully growing grapes for wine-making in what is now a notoriously chilly area of the UK?   That we couldnt do that now, because were still coming out of a mini ice-age, a mini ice-age that saw the Thames freeze over so hard every winter that in Victorian times, winter skating on the Thames was the norm?   That the earth has been far, far warmer than it currently is, and that weve only been recording weather for the past century or so? That these records are obviously going to show warming because were still coming out of the last big cold period?   That weve also been far, far colder than we are now?  And all before the earths population grew to the levels it is currently at? That none of this is caused or influenced by human activity?    The earths climate naturally runs in cycles.   Its connected to the activity of the sun, not man.   Heat makes and releases carbon dioxide, not the other way around.   Anyone who has drunk a can of Coke that has gone flat from leaving it opened without putting it in the fridge knows that.  If you put an opened can of fizzy pop in the fridge, it retains the CO2 for much longer, staying far fizzier than the can left out at room temperature.  Heat releases CO2.  Cold retains it.   It is impossible to alter temperature by trying to reduce carbon dioxide.   Temperature controls carbon dioxide release, carbon dioxide does not control temperature.    It isnt science when its consensus or conjecture.   Science is about facts.   Climate change science has not one verifiable fact to support it, just a lot of fear-mongering and blame put on people, who can somehow put the global climate back to non-warming by recycling and reducing their carbon footprint and paying taxes to do so.   AGW is NOT scientific. Neither is cow-fart methane as a cause of climate change.   If you believe AGW is backed by science, Mr Scientist, you are kidding yourself.   And if you cant see that, then plenty of us here would argue that you are not, at heart or in method, a genuine scientist.   Genuine scientists look for the truth, they dont go along with the loudest narrative and seek ways to reinforce that narrative through cherry-picking *almost* scientific facts or made-up data.  If you care to go back through this sub, there are countless highly technical papers explaining the power of solar activity, the absolutely minimal levels of CO2 produced by man, the levels of CO2 below which all life stops being sustained, and other enormous flaws in the non-logic of CO2 being bad and caused by human activity.   I wont be alone on this sub when I strongly suggest you go and read these items.   But then, given that youre already prepared to die on that hill, Ive never yet heard an argument to dissuade me, I think you said, or something similar, it is possible that your arrogance will not allow you to look at any information that conflicts with your long-held beliefs on this subject.

No question.  HOWEVER the President urgently needs to make additional remarks to re-affirm US commitment to international law, and calling for the prosecution of ALL war crimes, regardless of perpetrator.  Obviously a crude over simplification, but using [population stats from UNFPA](https://palestine.unfpa.org/en/news/pcbs-unfpa-joint-press-release-occasion-world-population-day) .... if the Gaza Strip's population were evenly spread out there are about 190 infants per km2  &#x200B;  |32.9|Birth rate per 1000 people| |:-|:-| |2,100,000|Population| |69,090|Calculated annual live births| |365|Total area of Gaza Strip| |190|Average babies under 12 mo per km2|  There's no question Hamas fighters actions were ["brutal" and "barbarian"](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/inside-story/2023/10/10/israel-palestine-conflict-and-the-gaza-war).

Everyone knows Biden communicated an "anything goes" policy towards Israel's military response.... that's widely reported in coverage of the President's remarks.  Better to just be upfront and straightforward, rather than tacking on a feeble disclaimer that no one believes anyway. But even better is to take a breath, and remember what America stands for. The answer to war crimes is NOT more war crimes.  Yes, Hamas beheading babies was barbic.  But so is starving and bombing babies.

You won't get sick. Every vaccinated person is a dead-end for the virus". Some of us vaxx-deniers thought once the vaxxed got covid anyway, they would see through the scam and the craziness would stop, but things didn't pan out that way. Instead along came the double-down narrative: "Your covid infection would have been so much worse if you hadn't got vaxxed..." Eventually this became "3 times plus a booster".  But a few things have occurred since, which have broken the plot continuity of the scam narrative, so people have stopped tuning in. These are the things I think contributed to people gradually losing faith and interest:  1. To keep the gravy-train going it was important to keep getting people to boost every 3 to 4 months, telling them their vaxx wears off in this time period and then they're no longer "protected" until they get their next dose. So whenever that time period or longer lapsed with no new booster, the vaxx-believers would start to get anxious especially as the media was always hyping up the  latest new variant. But then, just for purely statistical reasons, a proportion of these people would catch another bout of coof while waiting for their next vaxx appointment. To their surprise, the coof they got while "unprotected" - overdue or close to due for their next booster - was exactly the same as the coof they got when they were "protected". I think this on it's own wouldn't have been enough to break the trance, because they could always explain it away as being proof of just how great their immunity was from their first 3 or 4 doses, but then if it really was that great, why would they get sick at all? Still, not in hospital and not dead, right? So it must be working! 2. The myocarditis. They kept parroting the line that it would be worse from covid than from the vaxx, but still it shook them a bit. All those sports stars falling over. And how come Djokovic manged to win tournaments against vaccinated players? Unvaxxed as he was, he should have been dead, or at the very least imprisoned for being alive, unvaccinated and very good at tennis! 3. Us. You and me, babe! I don't want to overstate our role in breaking the narrative, but the fact was, the unvaccinated were a thorn in the side of the vaccinated for a long time because we defied logic and reason by refusing to die quickly in our millions. We got, or we didn't get, the coof pretty much with the same freqquency and with the same degree of coughing and sniffling as they did. Many unvaxxed people will say we actually did much better than they did, but I don't think we even need to get into whether or not that's true. The point is, if you were under 75  years old, reasonably healthy and unvaccinated, chances are you didn't do any worse than someone in a similar state of health who was vaccinated. For 2 years the vaccine-faithful waited for us to die, some of them wished we would die, some of them were terrified in case we'd cause *them* to die, simply by breathing air on the same planet as them... because somehow our unvaccinated covid would be so much worse than their vaccinated covid and so their magical elixirs wouldn't be able to work against it. And even though we should be too dead to walk around spreading unvaxxed covid, we were somehow too insensitive and covid-denying to succumb and lie down in our coffins. They kept this story up as long as they could, and it made some of them angry when the "Winter of Severe Illness and Death" came back for a Season 2. They maybe felt it would have been better script-writing if it wrapped up tragically at the end of Season 1 with all the unvaxxed villains dead and the story over. But 'twas not to be... 4. Different countries have different funding models for their healthcare, for example, in the UK where I live, medical care is free at the point of use for everyone and paid for out of general taxation. And it turns out it's expensive to keep buying vaccines that don't really work in a healthcare system that was already underfunded and struggling before covid, then had been brought to its knees by 2 years of lockdowns creating backlogs of patients who hadn't been able to see a doctor when they needed to. Plus the statistics were becoming very inconvenient and it was hard to ignore, so the NHS said, huh, maybe we'll only vaccinate the over-50s this time, then next time they said, hmm, maybe only the over-65s. Then because we have the internet we get to see what's happening in other countries. We even get to talk to each other. So when different countries start to fall out of lockstep and pursue different policies, people all over the world get to observe that it doesn't make all that much difference as far as covid is concerned.. It hasn't disappeared in the countries which keep on giving boosters, it hasn't decimated the populations in the countries where they don't.  Point 3 is why they wanted every single individual vaccinated, because they didn't want comparisons to be possible. Point 4 is why all countries had to be in lockstep, and why they want the WHO treaty to make sure that they're compelled to stay in lockstep and vaccinate everyobody when we have "the next pandemic" ^(TM).  The point is that the possibility of comparison - whether its with unvaccinated indiviudals, or countries going their own way - puts a teeny tiny crack in the narrative. It doesn't seem like much but it's enough.  For this reason, we're right to be afraid of more pandemic tyranny in the future. The WHO treaty would be disastrous, for example. But for now, there are cracks  in the narrative and that allows some light to get in. It's really, really important we don't let them close up the cracks. I believe if they try it again, it will backfire on them anyway. They accidentally vaccinated the global population (ironically) against bad story-telling. Many people are now embarrassed about the over-zealous vaccine enthusiam they embraced in 2021. They might not have come all the way over to seeing it from our side of the fence, and most of them don't really want to tallk about it, but they're no longer the innocent marks they once were.  We - humanity - took a bad beating over the last nearly 4 years, but we also learned some things. We can build on that. We'll need to, because the pandemic franchise doesn't know when to quit, even though viewing figures are down and the scripts are tired and repetitive...

Finland's latest nuclear plant, the one that went waaay over budget, produces energy at a similar cost to this project.  100GW solar equals about 20GW production, that's $5 billion/GW of net production (capacity factor of 20%). Nuclear has a 90-95% capacity factor and the extremely over budget nuclear plant in Finland ended up costing $11 billion. It produces 1.6GW of electricity and 4.2GW of heat energy (Finland uses this for district heating)  Usually wind & solar projects are way cheaper than this, and the main cost of using them is funding the backup energy or storage solutions that cost an arm & a leg (or are fossil fuels so pollute).

There is no evidence that there are more people willing to vote for some other Democrat than Biden. This is something really important which is missed by everyone clamoring for Biden to step down.

Palestinians were given less land despite having a larger population.  The land is not historically Israeli land. It has been lived on by palestinians for over a thousand years until jews colonized it. I'm not even advocating that land be taken from Israel. Once someone is living someplace, it's unethical to move them for any reason, so the west bank and gaza are the only possible palestinian territory. With that being said, I'm not sure how Israelis can claim to want peace when they are unable to acknowledge historical wrongs.  Also, there hasnt been a democratic vote since 2006, at which point Hamas was campaigning as a moderate party and the other choice was corrupt. So Hamas being in power currently doesn't in any way reflect the sentiment of the average palestinian.   It's somewhat shocking how misinformed someone living in Israel is about this issue. Are you getting your info from the public education system?

While they did not believe in markets, they did not want to create a classless society.  They were anti liberal and anti marxism.  Yes, rich industrialists that were not jewish and were in party line got power, slave labor and money from the Nazis but at the same time their were a ton of state owned work programms ment to reduce the official number of people without a job, economic plannening and price controles and a lot of social programms ment to appeal to working / middle class people, sports funding, little vacations, volksfeste etc...  But the ideologically reasons for these have nothing to do with leftwing or rightwing economics but come from the far-right ethno nationalism and racial ideology of the nazis.  Getting Lebensraum and getting rid of jewish people was basically all that matters. The Nazi economy was not market-capitalism nor socialism, nationalsocialism is like Vampire that steels property and wealth from minorities, political enemies and other countries.   History for the nazis was a history of race wars that needed to end with the victory of the Nazis against the jewish people, which would end history itself. Seeing it as anything else is or any ideology fitting modern politics, is nonsense.

I readily accept that institutions possess a high degree of power over shaping culture.  What I deny is that it is wise to invest large amounts of power into the State over issues of faith, as thereby the State can just as easily dismantle any legislation designed to empower the Church simply by taking the opposite course of action. Furthermore, the State can actively suppress the activities of the Church when it is allowed to meddle in her affairs. Thus, I reject that there is any greater stability or virtue whatsoever in a Christian society characterized by the coercion on the part of the civil power.  In addition, I made the point that, by virtue of the fact that all men are fallen, and in a society where Christendom is dead (as has been the case for at least a century in the west), you cant rely on the virtue of a few leaders to bring about another Christendom born anew.

If we imagine a situation where millions of Palestinian are given the right to come to the territory that is now Israel state, the question is, in what status would return? Would they recognize Israel for example and become citiziens?  If Israel let all the Palestinians into Israel now (or better to say before the 7.10), the state would very quickly come to war within. Like the war in Yugoslavia with the genocide of populations, like Qarabakh etc. If there is an argument showing that this view is wrong, I'd be happy to hear it.

"Dear u/archimid  I appreciate your concern for the enviornment and sense of urgency for the climate crisis and I share it too, don't get me wrong, I'm as concerned as you are. However, let me answeryour questions in a bit more detail, I am in no way undermining the sense of urgency.  For the Hippos on the Rhine question: I do not possess an idea about that, however as per you it's a thousand years and I assume you're right.  For the which hemisphere bears the brunt: Heat-wise it's the northern, no doubt. The southern hemisphere bears more of the storms though, here's an article that'll help you learn more  https://new.nsf.gov/news/southern-hemisphere-stormier-northern-we-finally#:~:text=Looking%20over%20past%20decades%2C%20storminess,to%20changes%20in%20the%20ocean.  The Southern Hemisphere has much more ocean than the northern, and that is a key factor.   You're question though, about bearing the brunt, is based upon too many variables, however a simple extrapolation would be the northern, both because of population, as you mentioned, and because heat adaption is more difficult compared to storm adaptions.    On the tropic v/s upper latitude questions, you're very wrong, unfortunately. The tropics  (where I live), are already very hot places and climate change makes them hotter. It's like saying turning the knob on a 15 degree stove to 30 degrees is more impactful than turning the knob on a 40 degree stove to 50, to the well-being of the stove residents. The tropics are always more vulnerable to any tenth of a degree of warming, which is currently masked by aerosol pollution. Adaption has a threshold.   For the pole question: I can describe it to you in the aspect of the Earth, but I cannot with respect to human civilization. It's nota foreign world, it has occured in the past, however, at current rates, it hasn't happened, and I'm not a research fellow in this field, so I cannot tell you exact details.

Heres an actual extract from the article.   Vernimmen and Hooijer spent the past few years filtering the new satellite data for Earths immense coastline, comparing elevation estimates gathered from radar with the newer lidar-based measurements. It wasnt pretty.  The scientists big finding is that forests and buildings along the coast have skewed radar maps, presenting planners with inaccurate elevation data. Lidar showed coastlines often lower than first realized. This has two important implications: the same amount of sea level rise will be able to reach much farther inland, and its going to happen a lot sooner than expected.  The scientists new lidar-based estimate predicts that roughly 482,000 square kilometers of land will be submerged with one meter of sea level rise, nearly triple the 123,000 square kilometers predicted by radar-based projections.

Just as a purely Muslim Palestine would've been impossible that encompasses the entirety of the region. The Altneuland vision of Zionism, that of a multinational, multireligious society, certainly did not involve displacing anyone from their homelands. Ben-Gurion's desire to do population transfer arose after the violence had begun, I believe. Regardless, [we have some pretty clear evidence](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2011/11/israel-and-1948-did-israel-plan-to-expel-its-arabs-in-1948-or-not.html) that population transfer wasn't even the plan before the 1947 war, even if some leaders wanted it privately and seized on the opportunity to take things in that abhorrent direction.  >You don't have to be xenophobic to oppose a group of migrants establishing their own ethnostate in your country, especially one that will require you to leave your home.  Nor do you have to be xenophobic to be upset when a foreigner purchases a deed to the land you think you own from a country that doesn't represent you, and then kicks you out of your home because they're now the "legal owners." There's very good reason for some of the anti-Zionist sentiment among Palestinians from the get go.   I do think you have to have evidence that people knew, publicly, what some of the more immoral Zionists were hoping to do, to justify the massive opposition though - and I personally have not seen evidence of that. Otherwise, it's just a case of accidentally being correct with one's xenophobia. With the benefit of history we can see Amin al-Husayni's fearmongering about Jews destroying al-Aqsa as a bigoted act of hate, but if, 20 years later, some Jews *did* end up destroying al-Aqsa, would his bigoted hatemongering have actually been justified, prescient opposition? Or did a broken clock just happen to be right that time? Or in other words, are the Israelis who opposed giving Gazans work permits because they feared they would use that freedom to do something horrific just the bigots they seemed to be? or, because of Oct 7th, is their opposition retroactively justified? (for the record, I believe the answer to that last question is: no)  >And if you think freedom of movement trumps national borders, do you support the right of return for Palestinians?  As a matter of principle, in that I think all borders are immoral except in their use to protect people from those who mean to do them harm, generally yes.  For those still living who were denied it before and would be willing to be peaceful members of that state, it was evil when Israel chose to do so in the first place, and remains evil now.  For their descendants, also yes in theory, as long as they again mean no harm to the people living there. If we accept the /u/whoisthatgirlisee standard of open borders, then that necessarily means these returnees would be waiving whatever right they claim to have grievances over previous migration to the region. This does not mean they have to uphold Israel as a Jewish state, but I think it's reasonable for Jewish Israelis to claim Jewish self determination is contingent on having a state that has special protection for them. I think the only politically viable way to get Israel to give up its status as a "Jewish state" would have provisions in place that the Jewish population might "take the ball and go home" if they find themselves unsafe.  If, however, we accept that Palestinians were justified in being opposed to migrants with different political aspirations than them because it violated their territorial sovereignty without their consent, as far as I can tell the morally consistent view is that it is also justifiable today for Israel to deny Palestinians the right to migrate to their country if they have different political aspirations.  I'll also just flat out say, while I theoretically oppose borders and ethnostates, until the majority of the world gives up on those, I somewhat hypocritically believe it's okay for Israel to not be the first to do so, because of the unique way in which states denying Jewish refugees the ability to flee from Europe directly lead to a significant amount of the deaths in the Holocaust.   Possibly less hypocritically, I also believe the people of Gaza deserve some kind of special reparations from the world for denying them the ability to flee the war there.

You've got markets, and you've got policy. (And sure, policy can still constrain markets, it's why fishermen can still compete in regulated fisheries and why businesses aren't supposed to use child labor)  An unregulated market is not going to be able to stop climate change. It's quite possible that the necessary  policies will turn out to be so draconian that policymakers will be unwilling to enact them, letting people die instead. (The pandemic has made me much less optimistic about the power of policy to improve public health)  The key problem that would need to be reconciled, is that the rules for ecology are thought of in a completely different way than the rules for economy. It has been possible somehow to ignore the difference between these rule sets for the last century and more... but it's not going to be possible to ignore in the near future.  I like the multiverse approach: in some futures, the earth has stopped making oxygen, and only anaerobic life survives.  In other instances, humans manage to avoid a nuclear exchange, but have still managed to only barely survive.  Only the most lively and interesting futures, have societies that have chosen to embrace survival at all costs, and chosen a policy shaped by ecological realities instead of economic ones. That might not be the most realistic future I can hope for, but it's certainly the most interesting one.

There is nothing I have ever written that I would be happier to be proved wrong about. But the evidence is piling up. In fact, it can be said that Israel has never wanted peace  a just peace, that is, one based on a just compromise for both sides.

But hes not referring to the kind of peace that will bring about the justice without which there is no peace and there will be no peace.

And even if the countries of the Arab League present Israel with an initiative that could kick-start some type of peace process, that contains an explicit invitation to a new kind of dialogue weve never seen before, for which weve yearned for years  the Israeli government will totally and demonstratively ignore it for 12 years and counting.

There, at the deepest level, lies the concept that this land is destined for the Jews alone. Israel wants land, not peace. Lasting peace would require Israel to return illegally annexed Palestinian land. Israel will never do that. Its goal is to annex ALL of their land. No matter HOW angry the Palestinians become. When their resistance becomes violent, Israel crushes them - and cynically uses their resistance to justify its ongoing abuses. Meanwhile, more and more Israeli settlements are being built on stolen land. While Israel has methodically derailed every promising peace initiative for years.  2004: "A year before Israels unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, Dov Weissglass, minence grise to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, explained the initiatives purpose to an interviewer from Haaretz: The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process  And when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda... The disengagement  is actually formaldehyde. It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians." http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n15/mouin-rabbani/israel-mows-the-lawn  2014: "In April, when negotiations broke down after nine months, US Secretary of State John Kerry explicitly blamed Israel for the breakdown in talks. His special envoy, Martin Indyk, a career Israel lobbyist, blamed Israels insatiable appetite for Palestinian land and continued expansion of the settlements, and handed in his resignation." http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n15/mouin-rabbani/israel-mows-the-lawn  2015: The most immediate cause of this latest war has been ignored: Israel placed a prohibitive set of obstacles in the way of the Palestinian national consensus government.  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/opinion/gaza-and-israel-the-road-to-war-paved-by-the-west.html?module=Search&mabReward=relbias%3Ar

This variation of pineal gland calcification might also be associated with the sensitivity of the computed tomography (CT) scan used in the detection of pineal gland calcification. Different studies indicated that pineal gland calcification was significantly associated with age, sex, low altitude, low sunlight exposure, ethnicity, light, cell phone, fluoride intake, nutrition, and neurodegenerative diseases. A modern lifestyle like using electromagnetic field (EMF)-emitting material such as cell phones and audio/video players; using fluoride in mouthwash, toothpaste, and tab water; and using herbicides were also considered as the critical risk factors for pineal gland calcification. The prevalence of pineal gland calcification was highest in older age individuals compared with those of young and also highest among obese.   In this study, there is a high prevalence of pineal gland calcification detected by CT scan and most studies showed that males have a high prevalence of pineal gland calcification. Even though there is no clear justification for this variation of pineal gland calcification by sex of individuals, many other studies link such differences to the effect of melatonin on gonadotropins.  In this study, the pooled prevalence of pineal gland calcification was higher compared with many previous reports, which is more prevalent in the adult population compared with the pediatric. According to the qualitative analysis, an increase in age, male sex, and white ethnicity are the major socio-demographic characteristics that increase the prevalence of pineal gland calcification.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9987140/  We need to break the cycle of modern day living.

But, and here's the wrinkle, there were enough provisional ballots not counted that Obama possibly actually won. IIRC from the time, provisional ballots are only counted if a campaign contests the results. Because Obama won by over 100 electoral votes, there was no need to see if he had won NC.   Clinton lost by around 200K votes and Biden lost in 2020 by less than 100K. In 2022 the only statewide race in North Carolina was for the senate where Budd beat the Democrat by 122K votes in an off-year election.   As the article notes, the pandemic kept Democrats from going door to door to turn out the vote. Plus, abortion rights will energize a lot of Democrats in an anti-abortion state like NC.   But here's the thing, pushing Biden in NC is win-win regardless of the outcome in November:  * Win: Biden takes NC, which is a state Trump must win in order to get to 270. Neither Obama in 2012 or Biden in 2020 needed it. But no NC and Trump simply can't win. * Win: Trump & the GOP will be forced to spend even more money & other resources there that they will desperately need elsewhere. Trump winning NC might come at the expense elsewhere giving Biden a 2nd term.  Resources they will really need for the battleground swing states like Michigan & Wisconsin. Maybe even Georgia, where Biden ironically won in 2020 and cut Trump off at the knees for any possibility of winning. Losing Georgia meant that it didn't matter if they won Nevada AND Arizona, he had no path to victory.

Anyway, the one that I used is mostly history from a maximum of a 100 years ago, and it is crucial to understand the ongoing events. I don't get the "1000 years history" you bring up.   It is not about the number of deaths, it is about the modality and the intentions.   Hamas, bringing 1000 men, deliberately killed 1200 unarmed israeli civilians in only seven hours, torturing them, raping them, burning them alive, and kidnapped hostages in Gaza. It is, on all manners, a declaration of war.  (There are no proportionalities in wars, especially with terrorists who don't even value their people's or their own lives. That said...)   The IDF isn't killing 20.000 people "in retaliation". Sure, they are pissed off, who wouldn't be? But they are bombing, targeting Hamas soldiers, their supporters, their rocket launchers, their infrastructures, their guerrilla tunnels they've built instead of good sewers for Gaza... Yes, civilians are being killed as well by the bombs, but they are war casualties, mistakes, not deliberate killings. Hamas intertwines with the population, they don't all wear uniforms while fighting, they even use suicide bombers and some even pretend to be hostages in need for help, shouting in hebrew. It is not easy to fight against them, since they are terrorists. If the IDF didn't evacuate gazan civilians and didn't respect their lives more than Hamas does, and really acted in "retaliation", as you say, right now the gazans dead would be hundreds of thousands, it would really be a genocide. That is what Hamas would do if they had the same military force the IDF has.

And if it isn't 130k years ago, then it will be 3 millions, or 23 millions... it doesn't matter!  The important point here is the pace of the warming. Currently CO2 are rising at least (minimal estimate) 10 times faster than the fastest of the past 66M years (no data before).  Imagine your body temperature going from 37C to 41C in a short period of time? You'll die if it doesn't come back soon to 37C. Maybe you can survive a few days at 41 but that will be it. Now imagine that the human body temperature slowly rise from generation to generation, evolution happening, after millions of years the descendants of humans have a body temperature of 41C, they're not Homo sapiens anymore tho, it's a new species, which can perfectly survive with a body temperature of 41C (it's possible, birds have this body temperature if I remember right).  That's why the argument of looking at past periods where the Earth temperature was +4C warmer is flawed. The Earth had time to adjust, its organism to evolve. But now it's rising so fast (saying it again, 10 times faster than the fastest observed in the past 66M years), that the consequences of +4C won't be the same at all. Trees won't have time to adapt, 50% of the world will became a desert, ecosystems will collapse... the world will became uninhabitable!
2021-06-12 13:24:59, 0.02115136975296287, reddit_opinion_democrats.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: Okay, Here's my response:  The premise of my entire post is based on the idea that there is a conservatism, a political ideology, with a unique intellectual linage and unique parties, and that likewise there is a Christian Democracy, a different political ideology with its own unique intellectual linage and unique parties. English Academia has historically been quite unable to acknowledge this point. Up until recently, Christian democracy was seen as akin to Disraelis conservatism. More recent Christian Democrat academics have laboured to rectify this problem and establish a difference between the two ideologies.  I started my comments on conservatism with the statement that conservatism is often badly defined -  as there is a large degree to which the term conservatism is contested publicly. But, its worse than that. Conservatism is unique in that many have described it as an ideology that [resists theoretical expression](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/#NatCon). This makes comparing conservatism and Christian democracy extraordinary difficult. My solution to that was to form a loose definition of conservatism, and then point out how Christian Democracy differed from conservatism both definitionally and historically.  To challenge your points; Ill do 2 things; 1st Ill ground my definition academically. 2nd  Ill point out how I dont think conservatives have been enamoured with sanity.  1. My definition of conservativism is largely inspired by academic works of Nol O'Sullivan. In his article in the Oxford handbook of political ideologies, he provides 4 types of conservatisms; Disraelis conservatism and Thatchers New right conservatism, Radical conservatism and reactionary conservatism. These latter two are European conservativisms, are distinct from Christian democracy and had been discredited due to their links with Fascism. More recently, some academics added  populist conservatism to O'Sullivans typology. I think this addition is justified; there is a clear difference between Trump and Boris Johnson on the one hand and Thatcher and Regan on the other   From what Ive read in both academic works and news articles, there seems to be a preference for Disraelis conservativism as the basis of conservative principles. This is why I narrow my definition of conservatism to the Disraelian description, and then applied this description to all conservatism. TBH, there were a few other reasons to focus on this conservativism; it provided analytical simplicity, and because I find it to be is the most respectable conservatism. However, I do understand, not all conservatism is the same. 2. I dont think conservatives have been enamoured with protecting or prompting sanity. Of the 5 types of conservatisms Ive listed; I know wed both acknowledge that 3 lack sanity; the two European conservatisms and populist Conservativism. Id argue that New right conservatism is not driven by a view of defending sanity against the past and present, as the New right conservatives imprinted their own insane view of economics on society. Thus, we are left with Disraelian conservatism.   As I mentioned, I respect Disraelian conservatism. I think your description of conservatives fighting against insanity in the future best fits Disraelian conservatism. However, Disraelian conservatives were about limited government to promote gradual change. They would not challenge current insanity much, as that would violate limited government. This impeded their ability to fight against future insanity. If a left wing party aggressively legislated its insanity, the next conservative government would pragmatically accept the majority of these changes. Disraelian conservatism is not a challenge to insanity, but a lever to determine its pace of progress. One could even say these conservatives believed that sanity is achieved by maintaining a slow pace of accepting insanity.  &#x200B;  >If the label leaves a bad taste in your mouth, its just a label and one doesnt need to take it  The reason I am a Christian Democrat is because I do not support conservatives politics. I do not accept the modern new right conservativism which dominates conservativism were I live.  I have academics friends, who, in a similar situation to me, shunned new right conservativism, but tried to redeem conservatism in its Disraelian form. I also reject Disraelian conservatism, as it does not do what Christian Democracy does. This goes back to my main post. I reject the label Conservatism because I do not hold to the conservative political ideology, in any of its forms.  A few final notes; First, something can be said about whether Christian democrats hold to socially conservative ideas. But that is different from the political ideology of Conservatism. Second, I would agree that Christian democrats should pursue policies that conserve sanity. However, I feel that politicians of all kinds would accept this, given their own definitions of sanity.

Replace voters with men and youll see an amazing difference.    Black men understand that the DNC is now The Party of Free Shit for Women and are walking away. This has paralleled (or possibly amplified) by  the de-coupling from the mainstream black matriarchy (one of the most staunch and fervent supporters of the Dems and left).  Pop culture personalities like Kevin Samuels are reflective of the movement.  For the first time in modern history, black men are challenging the efficacy and origins of their matriarchal culture. The outcomes of the modern, single mama-version of this culture have been dismal. More so for the black men, as there is no gubmint safety net for men (outside of prison).  Meanwhile, his mother fellates Uncle Sam for resources, having done so since LBJ destroyed the black family.   Couple that with what Trump actually DID for the black community. Lowest unemployment ever. Giving money to HBCUs and keeping them alive. Actually being the first to reach out with the Platinum Plan. Black men had a Bugs Bunny-esque waaaaaait a minute moment.

At least have some intellectual integrity.  Population of Arabs in Israel pre-1948: 950,000 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel#:~:text=1948%20ArabIsraeli%20War,-Most%20Jewish%20Israelis&text=Of%20the%20estimated%20950%2C000%20Arabs,%25%2C%20some%20156%2C000%2C%20remained.  Population of Jews in Israel pre-1948: 630,000 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews#Growth  Pre-1948 it was a 2:3 population ratio in favor of Arabs. The land was British controlled and the British mandate always favored a 70-30 land split in favor of the Arabs.  Heres three things that changed the equation: 1. The Holocaust. Not sure if I need to send you a link to read about it, you never know these days. In any case, 3 million Jews became refugees, and the population of Jews in Israel grew to nearly one million. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/immigrants-to-israel-1948-1952  2. Ethnic cleansing of Jews in Arab countries. 900,000 Jews who lived and were ethically based in surrounding Arab countries - Iran, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, Libya etc were expelled from their countries simply because Israel was born. These people didnt even want to leave, and where exactly would they be able to go other than Israel. The right of return was based on an existential threat facing Jews worldwide. This dramatically grew Israels population and wasnt even by their design.  3. The British Mandate favoring Muslims dramatically changed when the Grand Muftah in Palestine allied with Adolf Hitler in their shared vision of a Jew-less world. So why should the British reward traitors to their cause? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini  The limitless immigration you speak of is not a gift, it is a recognition of the curse of hatred faces by the Jewish people around the world. In a perfect world there would be no need for the right of return or Israel in general, but the reality is, some people dont want Jews in their country and others dont want Jews to have their own country. So basically, that existential fear is rooted in the Israel psychology, and coupled with Hamas explicit aim to end Israel, has only fueled the more extremist parties in Israel.

Had the attack been concentrated at a single area it would have been much more likely to cause damage. Iran wanted to signal its capacity for deterrence. You are also correct that that this was an attempt to make other actors in the region seem weak, and it was effective for that purpose, particularly against Jordan who, in spite of being home to a significant portion of displaced Palestinians, was obligated to shoot down Israel bound rockets from Iran.   Israel gets to demonstrate how effective its defenses are, and to draw remind the West of the threat posed by Iran. If Israel does not want to escalate, the would probably fire at Iranian proxies and we would consider the situation over. We could definitely see this end with both countries saving face, this situation was designed by Iran to allow for this.   The fear, though, is that Israel desires escalation. If western nations might cease aid to Israel during their war against Hamas, they would certainly not do it during a wider regional confrontation. Israel has won wider regional confrontations before, and there are many is the Israeli administration who believe they would win again. Some believe that wider war with Iran is inevitable, and that allowing Iran to grow stronger is foolish. The sooner the war, the more it favors Israel. This is the risk that has people concerned.   But as it currently stands, you are correct. If anyone lost out it was the Iranian taxpayers who paid for the weapons, and the US and Israeli taxpayers who payed for the defenses all so that this show of force could strengthen the political positions of the administrations. For the sake of providing a counterpoint, I will argue that makes it a lose-lose rather than a win-win, but I think you are well reasoned and have a strong understanding of the situation.

A focus on sustainability will do. Overconsumption of resources, especially by the rich, must stop. Other behaviours could include utilising maximum output of every product and using less cars and more public transport. These combined will be guaranteed to help. Also don't eat or eat less meat.  >How much of an impact would omitting air conditioning from our culture have?  Unfortunately for the people in the tropics and warmer climates, not using ACs would be a bad choice considering the warming enviornment. While it's true ACs cause massive emissions, it is also true that the current warming has made a vicious cycle of cooling through AC and the AC emissions warm up the planet. Alternatives to AC, which are eco-friendly should be a priority of development, especially in the global south. He told me that a few developments are under way, for eco-friendly cooling.   Cutting out AC is a double edged sword for now, and until we find an alternative solution, it'll remain a problem.

Britain helped the Arabs overthrow the ottoman who controlled that land in ww1. The ottomans turned the area over to britain. Britain promised the jews israel in exchange for there help in ww1. Britain promised to the Arabs they would set up states for them in the middle east if they helped except in west syria since it wasn't strictly arab(palestine) though I suspect the real reason it was excluded was because it was already promised to others. Regardless yes your people as you put it were crappy to jews. Yes germany was worse. No Britain didn't do any of this for moral reasons. Yes they had the legal authority to partition the land since the ottomans signed it over to them. Palestinians should have accepted one of the partitions instead they chose war and lost.

Trumps approval rating at this stage in 2019 was based on the fact that he was still riding the economic wave that the Obama-Biden admin created over 8 years. Basically he just didn't RUIN anything.  The start of his issues handing covid were still around 4-6 months out if we kind of start with the "it'll be gone by Easter" comment that truly sent him flying off the rails when it wasn't.  To Trumps credit, he did initially do a few things correctly in terms of listening to experts and with his messaging - but it didn't last for more than a few weeks until he made it extremely clear that he was willing and eager to sacrifice citizens without showing empathy to make sure his own financial position remained decent.  And then he was too dumb to just say "we've made some miscalculations but we are Americans, and being united will get us through this coming out strong than ever."  I sincerely believe that if he EVER SAID THOSE WORDS ONCE before election day, he would still be President.

I've personally seen this ebb and flow for so many decades now.  A LOT of worldwide pressure was placed on the Israelis to pull out in 2005 to give the Gazans the chance to finally prove a two-state solution was possible. Like many others, I cheered that day because it had felt like such a long time in coming and would give peace a real chance.  The world was proven wrong about Gaza on 10/7.  The issues that killed the dream for Gazans were that they had 17+ years to take charge of their "land", get rid of Hamas, and learn to self-govern themselves. Instead, they left Hamas in charge, never rose up against them, and stood by and watched (and even cheered) as innocent civilians were slaughtered in their homes and bed on a peaceful holiday morning by the very same Hamas terrorists who'd been killing them with an iron boot on their necks for decades.   The Gazans have been shown they don't care enough to even fight for their own corner of the world. Why should anyone else feel otherwise?  The world will still talk about it publicly to placate the westerners too young to remember that this has all happened before...and every option has already been explored and has now failed.  But no one's seriously going back to that well ever again.

There was a lot of things saying it was Hamas and I thought, yes, that seems like a good possibility looking at the crater etc. But then I saw the report about the doppler shift from the mobile phone recording and the location of the phone in relationship to the strike and the marks around the crater that indicated direction with a certain degree of accuracy and it never came from the direction the video of the Hamas rocket that was shown everywhere exploding midair. So now I'm thinking there's good evidence for the shell (probably not rocket) coming from outside Gaza to the east. Also that sound, it's spot on for a shell sound. You know if you've heard it before.  So yes, do your research, I agree. But your first example is poor. I say this not because I support Hamas but because often it takes times for a variety of evidence to be examined. Making your mind up quickly is not wise.  I would say the same about the Al-Shifa hospital. I reserved judgement and was quite willing to accept Hamas's use of the tunnels even if Israel had built the underground area. It seems they did have tunnels but it looks like not so much a command centre as was thought by the Israelis. Bad intelligence or not? I don't know. Did it warrant such a lockdown and shooting at the hospital? No, I don't think it did. Hamas's decision to use those tunnels doesn't negate the rights of innocent patients being protected with the hospital though. They are still protected by the Geneva convention.  In general I would say Israel would have won the marketing war much more if they had used ground forces and special forces more when going in rather than trying to level northern Gaza. 50% of buildings either damaged or destroyed? That's a hard sell as they say. Of course a greater ground assault would have been difficult and costly. You need a 10:1 advantage in building to building fighting to be successful, which Israel does have. Yes, more Israeli soldiers deaths, but in another respect a hugely less death rate of innocents. But then Israel doesn't rate Palestinian civilian deaths that highly when it comes to Israeli soldiers. But that's often the job the military has to face, protection of all sides in terms of innocent casualties.

Yes, there are some sects of Judaism that would forbid praying at the Temple Mount.  And for that reason, they can opt to stay away.  Let's pretend that there is a sect of Islam which believes that, for some reason, Muslims should stay away from the Temple Mount.  Does that mean all Muslims or people professing to believe in some form of Islam should be prevented from access?  The Haredi have no more right to prevent access to the site than anyone else does.  They have every right to not use it themselves and maintain their belief.  As a secular state, Israel should allow the site to be used for religious purposes by Jews, Muslims or Christians, so long as proper respect and decorum are enforced.  Where the sites are active in terms of being Mosques, those services should not be impeded or otherwise imperiled.    With all respect to Umar, he made a very wise decision in his time to not show any implied disrespect a very important site for Christians, but it was also a practical decision, given the (at the time) large majority of Christians in Palestine.     However, as the ruler of the region, I would not expect Umar to be required to not enter the premises, so long as his presence did not cause a scene or disruption.    Obviously, as Caliph, Umar ruled in a theocracy which would have different rules than the secular state that Israel is today.  Where his respect for the Church was a laudable action by a ruler with the prerogative to limit access, Israel allowing access to the site under certain limitations is more like a duty, where the site is public.

And abortion rights are... "down" I guess (as I'm interpreting your emojis). But these are the product of a top down campaign by the republicans (and foreign interlopers) to destabilize democracy. What the fuck was Biden supposed to do to "suppress fascism" in two years *other* than what he has been doing, which is to prosecute acts of domestic terrorism and try to promote American democracy in a functional way? And it's not like he let Roe slip passed the goalie. SCOTUS just finally got the majority they needed to turn full christo-fascist. This is the part where the other two branches matter.   Plenty of people (and some anti-American governments) have tried to do what you're doing - namely, try to harness the populist, anti-neo-liberal sentiment of Bernie supporters and try to flip them against the democratic party as somehow being "the enemy". But for the most part, they aren't the enemy.

Whatever milestone solar managed in 2019, in 2022 it is accounting for all of the growth in energy consumption.  You seem to want to jump from global statistics to discussion of first world issues. This is disingenuous. The developing world has always followed the developed world, why would you expect any different?  EVs are powered by electricity that's 2/3 generated by fossil fuels- but you neglect to mention that's A LOT better than all of it, nor do you mention that power plants are both massively more efficient and less polluting than the millions of car engines they're replacing.   Next you move on to complain about how nuclear isn't being ramped up- but even though you can yourself an economist, you fail to mention the cost. Nuclear power is a dinosaur and to utilities, a millstone around their necks. They're too expensive! Nevermind the 10-15 year lead times from groundbreaking to generation. You can wait for that but not for solar? Really?   Utilities aren't breaking ground on hundreds of renewable energy projects because they feel like it, they're doing it because it's cheaper. Cheaper than nuclear by far, and even cheaper than coal and oil. And they're buying storage as part of the package, making the electricity generated dispatchable. Base load generation doesn't do that; it's use it or shed it.   Finally, you leave the impression that the sky is falling- but propose no real pathway to net zero. None! You have lots to complain about but- other than nuclear, which has discredited itself (see the cost overruns for Votgle 3 and 4)- you have no solutions!   Humanity has spent the best part of 200 years building out our fossil fuel powered energy production fleets and transportation networks. Do you seriously expect that to flip overnight?

The results of the 2020 election show that their efforts have been successful, Trump nearly won re-election in-part by winning the greatest share of minority votes by a republican candidate in decades.  As for you OP, if your only reason for being against trump is racism and sexism then we need to have a talk because you need to be made aware of all the horrible things trump has done, not just the things he has said, before you too become brainwashed.

Especially because now we have social media (as an alternative to mainstream media) and we can see whats happening on the ground. We can witness the Press being killed. We can witness the violence in the West bank, almost in real time.  We can witness Israelis posting degrading videos about Palestine (and other way around). I could go on.

As many, if not more, Jews were displaced by Arab countries as Palestinians as a result of the war, which was started 6 days after the states inception before they had a chance to displace anyone, so no they didnt start that, they just won. The difference is that Israel looked after their refugees, whereas the Arabs made sure Palestinians would be treated as sub human in the Casablanca Accords.   Jordan and Egypt were occupiers until 1967, but nobody talks about Palestinians before that. Many peace deals and land proposals were put forward, all of which Israel accepted (even the one before the war that set us on this path of hatred). Im not here to tell you the deal Palestinians have been given is fair, nor do I believe Israels actions are just today. I think its shameful how far weve strayed from humanity.   But lets not rewrite history and pretend everything was sunshine and rainbows before Israel, nor is Israel the only aggressor and culprit for this sad situation. I guarantee Arab nations wont lift a finger until the Palestinians can no longer come to their lands (ie the genocide is effective), because they dont like nor care for the Palestinians, the Jews are their target and genocide will warrant its wiping off the map.   Its a shame such selfish, horrid leaders are in charge of this conflict. So many people dead and dying, cursing each others names as they go. Its exhausting watching the world bicker over whos right instead of calling for justice from all the greedy leaders that would never go to the front lines where they are happy to send their own people. I hope peace comes out of this.

Israel has a right to defend herself.  Of course it's tragic that innocents get caught up in this (just like the innocents butchered in their homes on Oct 7), but this is what happens in war - there are casualties. On all sides. And this is a war Hamas started, clearly not giving a shit about the fate of their own people.  You can have deep empathy for this child and others caught in the middle of a war they didn't start, but be rational. People who support the Israeli people do not inherently condone the deaths of Palestinian civilians. They want Israelis to be safe from Hamas, they want Palestinians safe from Hamas - but how the hell else do you eradicate Hamas if not by answering violence with violence?

Have you hear of the [1929 Hebron Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre)? Or maybe the [1834 Safed Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1834_Safed_pogrom)? Jews have been living in Israel for millennia (albeit a minority), and were often massacred by their "loving" neighbors, be they Arab or other.  Only since the 1930s when Jewish numbers grew due to immigration did Jews start to defend themselves. Look at [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_and_massacres_in_Mandatory_Palestine) of massacres in British Mandate Palestine, you will see the perpetrators begin off all Arab, and then around the late 1930s it switches to the Jews.  But who doesn't like to root for the underdog? So let's root for the losers of multiple wars that decided who rules the land (never mind who initiated those wars)?  Has Israel been an angel throughout? No. Should Israel have been established in the way it was, with the intention of driving out the other locals? Probably not. Should Israel keep their military occupation of the WB going? No, as this leads to more desperation and struggle. Should Israel remove their security measures (which make the occupation unbearable)? No, as these measures were only put in place as a response to the Intafadas and other suicide/terror attacks targeting civilians, removing them endangers their population. Should Israel annex Israel and give WB Arabs full rights? It sounds nice, but it effectively would mean an Arab majority, so Israel would be dissolving itself.  Can a 2 state solution work? No, definitely not if your slogan is "from the river to the sea Palestine will be free" - "by any means necessary" (including slaughter). Not if Hamas's founding charter is the slaughter of Jews worldwide. Not with decades of an official Pay for Slay policy by the Palestinian Authority, in which the PA prioritized paying salaries to terrorists who murdered innocent Jews above all else  the more Jews they kill, the greater the financial reward they receive. Not as long as they indoctrinate their children un UNRWA funded schools to hate and kill Jews.  In short, no easy solution to the bigger issues at play. But to make it as if Israel is the baddy and Palestinians are the goody is a very simplistic view and plainly historically wrong.

Their personal experience is israel as a strong country, giving a big F-U to Palestinians. To them, the reason for this approach is stories, just like Palestinians tell their stories.  And it becomes a battle of narrative stories when the seen outcomes obviously favour israel.  After the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, muslims in the US suffered from discrimination. And muslims allied themselves with the progressive left for the anti-war movement.  Suddenly, you have a big core of Muslims in the progressive left, supporting gaza as another "west vs muslim" war.

So many people online seem to love the Israel controls Gazas borders narrative, but it doesnt, Gazas other neighbor is Egypt. How many in 40 needing treatment does Egypt treat? If not at least 1, equal to Israel, your position is already looking weak.  Yes. Because it's a well known fact. It's not even a secret. Even the aid coming in since October 7th is still subject to Israeli inspection before being allowed in. Goods first go to the Kerem Shalom crossing in Israel to be inspected, then only what has been approved by Israeli customs is allowed through. Part of Israel's requirements for the [Agreement on Movement and Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_on_Movement_and_Access) in 2005 was that Israel must approve everything coming into Gaza. Egypt's opinion on the matter is irrelevant as the agreement is between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Egypt isn't interested in being seen as helping violate their agreements with Israel so they abide by the agreement also.   >Also very relevant is how many in the 40 you state does Gaza treat itself (those need to be removed from the 40, they are what most would call a red herring)and even more relevant, how many more of the 40 could Gaza treat itself if it had used all of the $42b it received in foreign aid for building hospitals instead of tunnels and rockets to attack (not for defence!!), not to mention the billions stollen by Humus leaders  its top 3 leaders are reported worth $11b net.  You have an incorrect idea on what that foreign aid actually is. First off I have no idea where you're getting 42 billion figure worth of aid to Gaza from. The only source I could find was one saying aid to Palestinians amounted to more than $40 billion between 1994 and 2020. That was aid to Gaza and the West Bank though not just to Gaza. The amount of aid isn't that important though to the answer to your question. It's not money given to Palestinians to buy whatever they want. It's goods that are either donated or bought with money pledged by the nations donating to the people of Gaza. Gazan's don't get to pick what they get. They just get what other nations decide to send them and Israel dosen't forbid. Furthermore a lot of that aid money dosen't even go into the hands of Gazans. It's used to pay for things like doctors from other countries who work in Gaza providing medical care at foreign ran hospitals. Foreign aid isn't money directly deposited into accounts of Gazans who then order whatever they want off Amazon or Gun's and Ammo.   >How do you think it is possible that so many of the Hamas leaders are worth $Bs while the country cant pay for its hospitals?  I don't even have to guess on that either. It's publicly available knowledge. They get it from taxes collected on goods that are sent to Gaza collected by the government officials in Gaza. Plus donations from supporters. Mainly Qatar and Iran. That's money that's never actually held by anyone in Gaza to be spent in Gaza though.

I see people shutting down all over the place - not only their businesses and their social lives but their ability to handle complex negative topics of conversation. Optimism bias is booming, and pushback against any "pessimistic" view of the future is increasing at the same rate (or faster) as"doomerism".   The economic impact of COVID means that there is less money for leading-edge endeavors. Green "recovery" plans are being cut due to ongoing, and deepening economic woes. The (not so) slow death of the middle class means fewer people are able to take action into their own hands (fewer people can afford land/solar power/electric cars/heat pumps/renovations for efficiency. Fewer people can afford to spend more on more "sustainable" products).   While demand for fossil fuels has taken a hit, it means that we have existing extraction capability sitting and waiting (and leaking methane, for example) for whenever (or if ever) the endless demand for growth increases our gross demand for energy. It's unlikely that demand for fossil fuels decreasing doesn't also impact the demand for renewables.   An increasingly stressed world, with increasingly impoverished people, and more sociopolitical infighting/stratification/bipartisanship is leading away from the large scale systemic cooperation that is *mandatory* if we are to address climate change in a meaningful way.   Numerous startup businesses - many of them environmental/green/sustainable focused - have gone out of business due to the pandemic.   COP events were already mostly useless greenwashing for the masses - the real issue will be the hit to scientific field studies, especially in remote areas such as the Arctic/Antarctic and glacier regions.

In the words of Wile E. Coyote: A legitimate question, young man, deserving a legitimate answer.  In general, its because of the Southern Democrats who were always against seeing Blacks succeed in America. After the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964 under a Democratic administration, they jumped ship and joined the Republicans.  In specific, its because of Jerry Falwell. He fought desegregation by opening a private school for whites only, and making it a religious institution. When the IRS decided in the late 1970a that his school was not in fact a religious institution and therefore owed taxes, he decided to double down and frame this as a government attack on religion. He poured money into getting Reagan elected in 1980, and a side-effect was that his racist and misogynistic religious views wormed their way into the party platform and have remained there ever since.

One of the things we're doing is outreach to other climate and political groups.   The constraint we're dealing with is that the utility is very politically connected, and city council members are fearful of TEP either going directly to the state legislature and preempting the city, or funding opponents campaigns during council elections in 2023 if they don't get a franchise agreement before the city has time to consider the climate implications. As a result council members are deferential to the utility, thanking them for the great work they do for the city.   If the council does move forward with a vote, an election will be held for voters to approve or deny the agreement. It comes down to an election, broad community opposition will need to be organized in a few months. I have no idea how to organize that and what's most effective.

We dont confuse American citizens with US army war crimes why should we treat any civilian anywhere else differently.   I don't care what happens to Hamas, but the innocents and children that are trapped there do concern me.   Anyone who jumps from pro Palestinian and assumes that's pro Hamas is not making a genuine argument. We dislike what Israel is doing for the same reasons we were shocked and horrified at what Hamas does, harming civilians with extreme brutality and disregard. If its wrong for the goose its wrong for the gander.   I sometimes imagine what living in these cities under shelling in Europe or in Gaza and I imagine its my neighbor who's lifetime of work in his home is leveled.

As well as some dissolutioned centrist right wing Christians.  The only problem is the Christian Right is by far the biggest manufacturer of atheists out there, and the American Left has a culture too heavily rooted in secularism. Which is understandable considering the fact our country is so diverse. CD mostly arose in the more homogeneous European societies. If CD were to be on the right in the US, it wouldnt be any different from the modern GOP.  I think what CDs should do instead is to gather as many supporters/sympathizers as possible. Do what I said, but use their minority status to influence politics the same way Libertarian Randroids, Paleocon nutjobs, and militant SJWs do.  Though not to promote theocracy, not to denigrate democracy, and not to take over anything. Just to promote an ideology that opposes rampant consumerism, hedonism, and hate.

Turns out we are still going to face this head on.  Major crop failures from unseasonable weather and draughts and floods in my region and across the country are increasing patters of food insecurity while living in a major export region/country.  Food prices in Africa are already fueling civil wars.  Croplands globally are shrinking from desertification and urbanization.  We can't possibly grow all our food needs indoors. That would require a massive population correction  All it takes is one late frost to bankrupt farmers or send them into a debt spiral. One untimely hail and they could lose a crop aboyt to be harvested. Not to mention heat triggers locust swarms and other related issues.  It is a serious issue.

From a generalized point of view, I don't even hate it since I though it was weird anyway that he would have had to produce the judgement to appeal. Granted it is civil court and so different rules apply, I wouldn't want an appeal to require being able to produce the entire judgement. It just sounds like "hey, to appeal this judgement, you have to be able to absorb this judgement." Being able to absorb a judgement really doesn't have anything to do with whether or not the judgement was fair, even if in this case it seems as if it is.

Their product causes climate change full stop. On the other, theyll never change without people like you working for them.  In my experience as a consultant working for an O&G company, theres very little real interest in supporting climate change or being part of the solution. I created some materials for a project I was working on for them and basically said you should talk about your role in the energy transition during recruiting. The response from the Director level person was was we dont talk about that here. When I heard that, I was basically done with the project (quiet quit) and just mechanically did the rest of it.   Another client I worked with, was the head of fuel at a company, and during a conversation he said we dont know if EVs are going to be a thing, maybe its hydrogen (spoiler its not, EVs are already 20% of US car sales while H2 is at 0.) He also generally had some disparaging remarks on EVs that I cant remember.  These are just 2 experiences Ive had with legacy energy folks, again as a consultant.

As far as your point about "interviewing God", the Christian perspective is that God has revealed a great deal to us over the years and that this is primarily compiled in Scripture. Exegesis is a subdiscipline of theology. Asking God, "what do you think about homosexual activity" is to ask a question that has already been answered by His Church using theology and philosophy.

Very little.  Maybe you'd have to replace a glass pot because induction burners only work with metal pots, but that's not one of those life-shattering changes.

Im not saying its wrong morally. I am only saying it didnt work.   And then nato forces left. Scratch that. They fled. And the countries they occupied collapsed and descended into state of nature chaos. The U.S. was forced to return to Iraq, at great cost to Iraqi civilians. It hasnt returned to Afghanistan, but it will   7. Yes. The Allies rebuilt the axis powers. The defeat of the axis was complete and total. Rebuilding the axis powers worked because the aid sent by the Allies was supervised and the recipients were capable.

The youth vote hasn't convinced me that they'll show up for every election and even if progressives *should* appeal to most voters, plenty of Fox News voters don't see that.

I just hope you understand that I don't see anything that I would consider to be extreme weather. Im not saying that climate change is not happening, nor am I saying that we dont have a hand in it. But humans have had to deal with climate change for the entire existence of our species. 10,000 years ago, where I am right now writing this was under miles of ice! That is a lot of global heating to get to today. I think we can adapt to anything that comes our way.  The question is, through all the fear mongering, will our food sources not be able to sustain our 9 billion population? Will we or the environment be able to react and adapt. Listen, there is no way we can all live on this planet and not expect climate change. But i also feel like we should not attempt to try to keep the climate the same. We need to adapt. And we need to encourage innovation to work in this condition. We should always be trying to adapt.   I noticed i got lots of negative reviews, but why? You think the storms, heat waves, hurricanes etc are worse then before? I totally remember worse storms. It is not in the abnormal territory yet, and to neg me for saying that is silly. I think that the propaganda that is supporting climate change has really scared people, and scared people do bad impulsive decisions.

Now theyre limiting aid to new arrivals as their instinct for compassion confronts hard budgetary realities.  In recent days, New York and Chicago  two of the nations largest cities  have instituted substantial changes to their shelter policies. In Chicago, the city began evicting migrants who had overstayed a new 60-day time limit, saying it did not have the resources to meet the need.  In New York, migrants had benefited from the citys unique right to shelter, which guarantees emergency housing for as long as anyone needs it.  Last Friday, those rules[were significantly altered for migrants without children](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=mMvlTZFjq_PLUS_X/RU7jGZrf4Q==), the culmination of a months-long struggle by the city to curtail its legal obligations to new arrivals as their number surpassed 180,000 and the cost of shelter soared.  Similar dynamics are unfolding elsewhere: In Denver, officials began closing some migrant shelters in recent weeks and reinstated time limits for stays. In Massachusetts, which has also seen an influx of migrants, the legislature is moving toward instituting[a cap on how long people can stay in shelters](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/03/05/massachusetts-emergency-family-shelter-time-limit).  For deep-blue cities with long histories of embracing immigrants, the latest influx of newcomers  many of them seeking asylum  has produced a sometimes-painful reckoning with their stated values. The impulse to welcome new arrivals is deep-rooted, but its expensive, particularly in cities with steep housing costs, said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute.

We know were not going to be able to stop climate change, but were going to fight like hell to avoid the worst case scenarios.  The reason Im trying to better understand the technical aspects of offsetting is that were considering launching a large-scale reduction/offsetting campaign. If we can tell people that every individual going neutral through reduction and offsetting would halt rising greenhouse gasses, thats a pretty powerful statement. Will it fully solve the problem? No. Will it be possible to get everyone involved? No. But it will be a step in the right direction, make individuals feel less powerless and more likely to act, and help to build momentum.  But we dont want to be making statements like that if they arent true. Hence my question :)

You can imagine the people 5 generations hence cursing our generations for leaving them with a poison legacy they can't afford to manage and can't afford not to. The "best" storage methods for hot waste so far all require replacement with very expensive materials after only a few decades of use - hard radiation degrades the best steel, and capsules corrode or burst due to helium build-up. Mountain caves collapse or use of the wrong kitty litter in low level waste causes canisters to burst... the list goes on. Somebody will always find a way to cut corners that eventually end up causing leakage later on.  So Nucear is likely *never* going to be carbon neutral, because of the timescales involved. We will probably run out of viable Uranium before we can shut down the waste storage facilities. I don't know if we run them on solar or wind power, but I doubt it.

But the conduct of Israel's government unfortunately does affect anti-semitism, just like the conduct of Muslim governments like Iran, can affect people's attitudes towards Muslims.  The criticisms you make of his tweet are correct and they are not tangential, they go to the heart of the matter.  That he sees Jews get attacked in the UK and he tries to shift the blame to Israel rather than towards the antisemites. When that Palestinian kid in the US was killed by his landlord, if someone tweeted a similar thing saying Islamophobia is always wrong and existed before Hamas, but this attack gives lie to those who pretend Hamass conduct doesnt effect Islamophobia, would you not consider that tweet itself Islamophobic? I would.  > But if they hired an anti-Putin activist to investigate Russian warcrimes, or an anti-CCP activist to investigate Chinese abuses, would that be so absurd?  Yes, assuming they want their reports to be taken seriously. Human rights investigations, if meant to be correct and not just politically useful, should be done by people who are qualified and unbiased. Not by people who have a political dog in the fight.  > I don't know about the founder, but nothing on the BDS website says anything about ending Israel's existence. Instead it demands an end to the settlement and occupation of the West Bank, equality of Arab citizens of Israel, and a legal right to return for Palestinian refugees to their homes.  Yeah, letting Palestinian refugees return to their homes (really, mostly the grandchildren and great grandchildren of refugees returning to their ancestors homes) is the method by which they plan to destroy Israel. And its not me who says that, its them.  Omar Barghouti, the founder of BDS said:  > If the refugees were to return, you would not have a two-state solution, youd have a Palestine next to a Palestine.  He also said  > a return for refugees would end Israels existence as a Jewish state. A two-state solution was never moral and its no longer working.  .  > This comment thread wasn't started about organisations that oppose Israel's existence, and no organisation we've talked about (publicly, I guess, depending on the BDS thing) do either.  I dont know what makes you think these organizations dont oppose Israels existence. They might not find it politically convenient to say explicitly at this moment, but they both endorse the BDS movement, which opposes Israels existence. And I think its a bit naive to read the complete bullshit they constantly spew about Israel and believe they dont oppose its existence (even beyond the endorsement of BDS, which is as close as you can get to being explicit about it).  > Calling international respected human rights organisations "Adolf" because they criticised a human rights abuse of Israel  Calling them Adolf was hyperbole, but Im sure it wasnt because they criticized *a* supposed-human rights abuse by Israel. Its their long pattern of antisemitism.   EDIT: it appears you replied and then blocked me so I couldnt respond? Too bad, I thought we were having a civil conversation.

All incoming aid is still inspected by the US and Israel, and items restricted to humanitarian supplies, and no people will arrive or depart Gaza on those boats.   The two major concerns in my opinion are whether Hamas will choose to escalate during Ramadan, and how will the US make the pier safe from any mortar/rocket attacks or just hungry desperate people.  There's also the issue of distribution once it gets to Gaza, but as we've seen, that issue is more or less the same regardless of delivery method.

The power of the atom, the heat of the sun and the steam stored deep in the Earth, the force of the winds and water must be main sources of energy for our grandchildren, and we can do it." - Pres. Gerald Ford, 1974  Ten years ago I saw a documentary, "Houston We Have A Problem", at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival. Times have changed since then! US production of crude oil bottomed out in 2008, so the oilmen in the film have a fairly apocalyptic view of the future of oil. It would be interesting to see what they're doing now after the 150% increase in US oil production during the Obama years.  Or for example James Hackett of Anadarko Petroleum talks about what fuels are used for electricity production. Checking up on it now, US electricity has gone from 50% to 30% coal, 30% to 20% nuclear, 20% to 32% natural gas, and 9% to 17% renewables (which Hackett at 16:16 doesn't even mention).  When Ford made that quote in 1974, right after the Arab Oil Embargo was ended, Republicans believed energy independence was a number one priority for the US, but a Democratic majority in Congress didn't follow Ford's lead. Because of the Embargo, some things were done, like the 55 mph speed limit and other energy saving measures, but they didn't really get behind a push for renewables.  The Ford quote is at 29:23. There's another good quote at 1:17:54 - "The Stone Age did not end for the lack of rocks. The Oil Age will not end for the lack of oil."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA6IHNzlfdc&feature=youtu.be  Here's the [text of Ford's speech](https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/740121.asp).

The PM also echoed that strategy and even went further to say that the issue is not only Palestinian Arabs, but Israeli Arabs as well. Given also Israels alleged involvement in oversees genocides and pillaging of African resources i would say criticism is well deserved   If Israel does violate international law then Zionists simply dont really care, and care much less about Palestinians. People call out Israel because it puts itself in a position to do so. The Middle East has always criticized western legalities and Israel has always sided with the western world.

The old style of racial hatred has vanished from popular discourse, at least the ones I frequent. I think it's more an issue of cultural judgments these days.  Here in the US, criticizing black majority urban areas along certain lines is seen as racist. I'd argue that that's the focus of the extreme majority of what Americans agree is racist, not anything along a biological trait logic.  The way in which Israel is criticized in progressive spheres seems to me pretty close to way black areas were disparaged in the 80s, a kind of dog-whistle that frames facts in the unkindest context and effectively communicates antisemitism to people who wouldn't want to be associated with the older version.

The more people involved, the more attention and support to the cause which will hopefully lead toto demands being met.   Im not part of any Zionist movement, but I can only speculate these are some of their thoughts: Zionists who oppose the protestors will say that Israel has a right to exist and defend itself. They will claim that the chant from the river to the sea implies the mass killing of Jewish Israelis which is an exaggerated and frankly stupid conclusion to make. They will say their lives are at risk with the encampments being there because they cannot access certain buildings or go to a class; inconvenience and disruption is the point of a protest and not being able to go to class/work for a few days pales in comparison with Gazans being displaced and losing their homes and lives. The ask then is to consider them as your neighbors and be compassionate when you complain how these protests affect you personally.

You assume we're so adamantly against taking Gaza for some ulterior reason. We really don't want to be saddled with a mistake Israel created and it's really that simple. Why should we pay for Israel's mistakes?  Look up Bir Tawil. When we don't want a piece of land, we may just not want that piece of land. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir\_Tawil)  2. Gaza is potentially a tourist heaven  Egypt doesn't need any additional touristic assets; we have plenty  3. It was historically considered part of Egypt  No it really wasn't for most of history. Gaza was the last stop *before* someone would come into Egypt.  4. It has well educated Arab population many of whom came from Egypt  \~90% of Gaza's residents are descendants of people from the Nakba. The idea that Gazans are Egyptians is not true.  ----  Lastly and this is what really astounds me personally. No one cares about what the Gazans want. The biggest reason Egypt doesn't want to take Gaza is that the Gazans themselves don't consider themselves Egyptians. If we were to survey the Gazans, in case their opinion matters here, they would overwhelmingly say they don't want to be Egyptians and don't consider themselves Egyptian. (They would also say they don't want to leave their land or homes especially knowing that they'll never be allowed back.)  This is the biggest reason why Egypt doesn't annex Gaza or take in Gazans.

We dont even have the choice.  Its not even about people needing to be careful or make lifestyle choices.  Its about the world that has been built around the power of private owners to suit their profiteering above all else.  If you live in most places in the US or Canada, good fucking luck not driving a car.  Electric cars arent the answer either, because the car isnt the answer.  Cars are stupidly inefficient and shouldnt be necessary, but they are because our city planning got reorganized entirely around the idea that every household would have at least 1 car, so that auto manufacturers and oil companies could create a captive market.  We literally had cities that were built from the ground up to be functionally useable by people, not cars, and they got bulldozed to create roads, highways, and parking lots.  The stuff we need or want to live happy, healthy, fulfilling lives isnt even close to the reason for climate change, its the way our whole societies have been structured around wasting energy just to make more money for the owning class.  We could still use gas in the future where it actually makes sense and is necessary, we could sustainably have beef and other meat products that are reasonably healthy and very tasty/enjoyable/important to peoples cultural diets, etc.  The problem is that the way we do all of those things is never based on what is needed, what is sustainable, what is ethical - *only what is* ***profitable***.    We might see some small changes, we might make some impact if people on a whole manage to get educated, and change their behaviors, but it takes a lot longer, and a lot more effort.  Take it back to my previous analogy, its way easier to stop the car by getting the person driving it to take their foot off the gas and press it on the brake pedal than to ask someone outside the vehicle to latch onto the wheels.  We need to put full responsibility on the people driving this planet into a catastrophe (the owning class), and ideally remove that drivers seat entirely.  Until then, it is more than just an uphill battle, pure insanity.

If your church wont grant their marriage certificates, I dont care, they can go somewhere else, or just get the state recognized one done at the court house. Allowing them state recognized marriages acts directly in opposition to the hook-up Culture that you rail against as well. Without the ability to legally and with the right churches, spiritually, be recognized as partners, part of the incentive to stay together falls away. And so if they cant marry, then they might as well just have sex with who and whatever and continue to live in degeneracy. Letting them get married helps decrease the ills you talk about.

And what you listed (going off-grid, not driving, planting native plants, which people need to do and are Solutions that I do not dismiss) are individual, small-scale solutions that many/most people are not able to do.  Exhibit A: Ditching driving. If people are going to ditch cars, there needs to be alternative ways to get around in place; the bus, walking, biking, etc. And most places in the US are not designed for anything but cars. it's a similar problem with not flying. If people want to take the train, there has to actualy be a train that can take them there.  And if people want to eat/live sustainably, they have to have access in their local grocery store to sustainably sourced and made foods/alternatives that are affordable.  My point is that there are no individual, small-scale solutions to both systemic issues and the climate crisis. If people want to live sustainably, the systems and infrastructure sort of have to be designed for people to live sustainably.  (Individual people, while having the power to change things, are also not the problem or the biggest contributors to the CC, though that's a topic for another day)  Sure, people need to rework their brains towards those things: Not driving, buying locally made things, repairing broken things, and just overall being intentional about what they are buying and consuming and so on, but I just kinda feel like it needs to happen on a large scale or else it's just gonna be (Literally)  putting out a  forest fire with a squirt gun.

They are not.    Eisenhower warned the US against embracing the MIC in his farewell address.  Notably, he became President because he had commanded SHAEF.  He was *not* a pacifist.  He was *not* saying: avoid possessing sufficient armament.  No soldier who remained proud of being a soldier would say that, it wouldn't make any sense!  So what *does* a MIC really mean?  Well, it means the military is dependent on the actions of industry **and** industry is dependent on the actions of the military, while each one keeps its separate end goals.  It's a symbiosis rather than a perfect alignment of incentive.  If industry doesn't produce enough weapons, the military will be sad.  You get this part.  The part I don't think you do is the obverse: *if the military doesn't use enough weapons fast enough, businesses will protect their investment in defense manufacturing by either pressuring the military to do so or by finding other buyers for those weapons*, and suddenly you've got police driving "surplus" MRAPs and seemingly endless limited foreign conflicts.  That's the part of an MIC that's not beneficial despite being armed sometimes being beneficial.  (P.S. I need to write a good canned response for posts that say "The left says this!" and then quote Democrats.  Those are centrists, full stop; I wish folks would please stop imagining that their incredibly (and inherently!) self-contradictory and corrupt politics are the best we can do in terms of **any** of libert, galit, or fraternit!)

The last democrat to win a Texas gubernatorial race was Ann Richards in 1990.   Cruz entered what was supposed to have been a non-competitive race with a double digit margin and wound up with a drubbing by Beto that forced him into a competitive race that ended with a low single digit margin.  Beto lost to Cruz by 2.6 percentage points and to Abbott by 11 percentage points.  Beto surprised republicans by making non-competitive races competitive again, quickly gathering substantial campaign funding from small donations, and lifting the prospects of democrats down ballot.  San Antonio Express News [ORourke exposed a blue spine across the middle of red Texas](https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/O-Rourke-exposed-a-blue-spine-across-the-middle-13415625.php) [Beto ORourke] pounded U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz along the route, flipping counties that had not voted for a Democrat for statewide office since Ann Richards first ran for governor in 1990. Even in the counties ORourke lost, his defeats were often much narrower than those of past Democratic candidates.  Texas Tribune [How the race between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke became the closest in Texas in 40 years](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/09/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-closest-texas-race-40-years/)  O'Rourke fell roughly 220,000 votes short out of 8.3 million of unseating Cruz, closer to winning a statewide office than any Texas Democrat in a generation. The strength of his candidacy helped Texas Democrats pick up two U.S. House seats, two state Senate seats and a dozen state House seats.  Vox [Ted Cruzs surprisingly competitive battle against Beto ORourke, explained](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/12/17841716/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-senate-midterm)  ORourke is within single digits of beating Cruz, recent polls found  a development that pushed the Cook Political Report to change the states partisan rating from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.  Houston Chronicle [Essay: 4 reasons why Beto ORourke lost to Greg Abbott](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Essay-4-reasons-why-Beto-O-Rourke-lost-to-Greg-17570063.php)  Unlike Texas Republicans in 2018, Abbott did not underestimate Beto. For the past year Abbott campaigned like his job depended on it while sparing no expense in a record-setting campaign, which through October 29 had spent $136 million, and will approach $150 million by the time the 2022 last campaign report is filed in early January.  Despite fast population growth and increasing diversity in Texas, the state is not [projected to flip blue](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/americas-electoral-future-3/) for six years at the earliest.  So Cruz may still be expected to win a statewide election against Gutierrez or Allred in 2024. But who knows, maybe Cancn Cruz will make another stunning gaffe and accidentally make the race competitive again.

So I would say the best estimate of the climate sensitivity is probably still 3 degrees Celsius. https://twitter.com/VariabilityBlog/status/1215332175731621889  But numbers always have an uncertainty range in science. Before the last IPCC report the estimate for equilibrium climate sensitivity was estimated to be between 2C and 4.5C with a best estimate of 3C. In the last IPCC report this was updated to a range from 1.5C to 4.5C. My blog post on this: http://variable-variability.blogspot.com/2016/07/climate-sensitivity-energy-balance-models.html  We now understand better why the studies that produced the update of the lower bound are not that reliable. So I expect that the lower bound goes back to 2C in the next IPCC report.  With the new model results, I expect that the best estimate remains 3C, but I would not be surprised if the upper bound goes up. That is a much more important change than the lower bound because most of the risk of climate change comes from damages in the worst case.

In the article its a case of a single person taking action against their own government for loss related to climate change. In the example I gave its of a government taking advantage.

I think the majority of the vitriol against opposition to the LGBT comes from a lot of fundamentalist evangelicals who dont really extend the basic Christian love we should extend all sinners, but this doesnt mean we dont recognize that morally its not ok. I definitely think that drag queen story hour and LGBT Ed for kids is not a good thing, but adults shouldnt be restricted from getting into partnerships or having sex any more than straight couples engaging in morally objectionable sexual practices. Although the gay marriage issue I do find a complex one.  Agree on porn, drugs and prostitution. I think a community policing approach where use is still discouraged and users are rehabilitated is a good option, coupled with a crack down on production and distribution.  I also lean rehab on criminal justice, but tend to take a tough on crime approach when it comes to the upper end of violent crime. Stuff like serial killing and child rape.  Multiculturalism I would say I am generally opposed to, except I think indigenous peoples should keep some of their ancestral land and preserve their culture within Canada (my country). I do think, though, that we should have more of a homogeneous cultural identity than we do now, but Im not opposed to immigration, as long as its legal and they generally assimilate. I think admitting a lot of Islamic refugees can be dangerous, but Id support admitting the same or even more refugees if they were Christians. It should still be strictly controlled, however.

Many folks also arent going to own and use guns for anything remotely militia or self defense related. Theres plenty of folks that only own guns to shoot paper with, hunt with, or partake in shooting competitions that lack mostly any self defense/militia application (Cowboy Action Shooting and trap shooting competitions come to mind; the number of occasions of people having to use their trap shotgun or lever action with cowboy loads in self defense is pretty damn low).  A county level gun club by comparison is a lot less divisive a concept that is easier to focus on baseline marksmanship, gun safety, safe storage practices, and allows for a broader array of interests and hobbies that encompasses gun ownership.

Its funny, you always hear people say for every bomb they drop Israel is creating more terrorists and Hamas members, but nobody ever stops and thinks about it the other way around. The world would be wise  to consider the effects of what Hamas has now created in the Jewish people: an awakening.  Theres no going back. Jews all around the world now feel there can be no peace and we are dealing with murdering, raping, barbarians. The raping in particular has pushed the needle to a place where it can no longer go back. Even those Jews calling for peace, or a cease-fire, are not actually suggesting living side-by-side anymore.   The Jewish people are now galvanized in a way I have never never seen in my lifetime.

Transparency is definitely a step in the right direction, but financial incentives are simpler for the consumer. Granted this does present a 'middle of the road' approach allowing industries to continue with out abrupt financial burdens while creating transparency. And maybe if we had several decades this would be the rout, but at this point we should be demanding higher taxes on meat, dairy, and any deforestation or rapid environmental degradation. I've been buying organic for decades, it is ridiculous to think a majority of others will do so voluntarily.

What i am seeing more and more is "not their fault AT ALL", which I find really problematic.  Autism levels are a bit of a mess in my opinion - but level 3 is specifically for those with limited capacity and high support needs. There are many people in level 3 for whom understanding these things is genuinely difficult.  These people often need large amounts of care. If it is to be prevented it has to be done by specialised teaching out of it which has to be tailored to them. It is not a case of "choosing not to" - its a case of providing them with the tools necessary to identify and avoid doing it which they genuinely struggle with.  While there are folks who are lower level 3 or borderline level 2 who can understand (and so what I am saying doesn't apply) - I want to make it clear that many in the group in question genuinely have a disability which might impair the ability to understand consent. This also applies to them giving their own consent.  *Btw - this is unrelated to my other comment which is about disabled people (incl. autistic) who have the ability to reason and consent.*

While falsification of business records in NY is just a misdemeanor, it becomes a felony if its with intent to defraud that includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof.  That means there had to be records falsified to cover a second crime, which was conspir[ing] to promote or prevent the election of any person to a public office by unlawful meanssince Cohen allegedly paid off Daniels in order to boost Trumps chances in the 2016 election.  Since that law requires defendants to have influenced an election through unlawful means, a third crime has to have been committed to show this.  There were two crimes committed that made the hush money scheme violate the election law:  1) The first was violating the Federal Election Campaign Act, meaning Cohens payment to Daniels was a contribution to Trumps campaign that exceeded the legal limitwhich Cohen already pleaded guilty to.  2) The second was falsifying other business records, after Cohen created a fake shell company to send the Daniels payment in 2016, or violating tax laws by making false entries on tax returns related to the payment.

Prior to 1917 the Senate rules did not provide for a way to end debate and force a vote on a measure. **That year, the Senate adopted a rule to allow a two-thirds majority to end a filibuster, a procedure known as "cloture." In 1975 the Senate reduced the number of votes required for cloture from two-thirds of senators voting to three-fifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn, or 60 of the 100-member Senate.**  The Democrats joined forces with Republicans to ensure this terrible deregulation bill got passed by making sure it had over 60 votes in the process making the bill filibuster proof. Without that help Bernie and some of the progressives could have filibustered the bill and put up some kind of fight but the rest of the senate dems made sure that did not happen..  2 teams..

I sometimes fall into depression seeing how ignorant the vast majority is towards our environment and our planet's wellbeing. It literally breaks my heart and that's coming from a 31 y.o guy.  I watched a lot of documentaries on the subject and as a result I went vegan/plant based 3 months ago. You say you want to become a loving person and cause as little harm as possible. Well in my case, being vegan actually helped me cope with the world, at least on a tolerable level. The fact that I personally am not contributing a single penny to mass animal factory farming and their consequences, is pretty liberating and relieving. I am also healthier, and educate my family and friends who are at open for such a conversation.. sadly not everyone is.  But change is coming and we can do our part.   I save a lot of fresh water by eating beans or mushrooms instead of beef or pork. (Like 11.000L water for 1 kg of beef vs 8 L for 1 kg of mushroom) And in the long run, it adds up. I'm also healthier mentally, and less prone to depression and emotional imbalance.   I gave up on wanting a family because I don't see how my future children would ever be thankful for bringing them into this sick world. We have the information now, our parents didn't have that much. We know a lot more about what is happening around the world than previous generations. I consider it my responsibility to not procreate, which is the single best way to reduce our impact on this beautiful planet, or what's left of it.  My partner agrees and she doesn't want children either.  This gives us a peace of mind to just do our part and enjoy our life while we can.. and not worrying about our children's z grandchildren's wellbeing is a blessing in disguise.  So all in all, I totally understand your climate anxiousness, but with some lifestyle changes and perhaps mindset shift, you could also make the most out of your life and do something meaningful with the decades ahead of you. Good luck and hyv piv!

This quantity is comparable to the positive vertical bias of the principle digital elevation model (DEM) used to assess global and national population exposures to extreme coastal water levels, NASAs SRTM. CoastalDEM is a new DEM utilizing neural networks to reduce SRTM error. Here we show  employing CoastalDEMthat 190 M people (150250 M, 90% CI) currently occupy global land below projected high tide lines for 2100 under low carbon emissions, up from 110 M today, for a median increase of 80 M. These figures triple SRTM-based values. Under high emissions, CoastalDEM indicates up to 630 M people live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100, and up to 340 M for mid-century, versus roughly 250 M at present. We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10 m above current high tide lines, including 250 M below 1 m.

Therefore its of course reasonable to say this person is shitty in the sense that Id rather get away from them or not have them in my life, but to me its not reasonable to say theyre inherently just a bad person or evil.

Im not sure exactly what your point is with that. The term Palestinian a as referring to a national group was coined in 1964 by Arafat because of their calling for a national home for Palestinians, but that doesnt mean they didnt deserve that state before 1964. Pre-1948, Zionist simply meant someone who believed Israel should exist. Or maybe an Oleh (Jewish immigrant to modern day Israel for the purpose of creating a Jewish state) is a better word. My point is that just because there wasnt a centralized term for it doesnt mean the Israeli national movement was illegitimate before they term Israeli was created.  2. Is Hebrew not a common language? We also have more than that: a shared cultural identity and system of beliefs that hasnt died because we have been isolated in most communities around the world.  3. The first solid idea for defined borders of Israel and an Arab state was UN resolution 181 (the partition plan) or maybe even the peel commission. Before then, both Jews and Arabs mostly just cared about terrorizing the British out of the land.

I cant think of a ton of places that would be good and fine to live. Melting pots of places where no one is truly a majority, but the economics of which reduce the chances of conflict.   I think that the manufacturing of a Jewish majority in Israel has created such a large amount of conflict in the Levant. A huge amount of steps, money, labor, and violence (yes, call it defense, but the world sees violence by a very well-armed force against people who have such limited means for one reason or another) has been needed to hold on to such a majority. I could be wrong, but I think manufacturing a majority in Israel has led to a rise in anti-semitism. Zionism has turned Judaism into a race that cant be escaped simply by changing a belief system. Thats a scarier position to be in, imo.   So I think this suspicion of persecution everywhere you go has led to a state that is engaged in quite a bit of violence. I think the world sees the violence. However justified it is (which I dont know how you could in most cases), Israel has put itself in a position in which its very possible that it could unintentionally (or develop an intention after years of attempts in vain to manufacture a majority and wondering why there was no peace to be had) to commit genocide. That is not a good position to be in for a country and for a countrys people that holds itself to a high standard of being a democracy.   My two cents.

We combine econometrically estimated responses of energy use to income, hot and cold days with future projections of spatial population and national income under five socioeconomic scenarios and temperature increases around 2050 for two emission scenarios simulated by 21 Earth System Models (ESMs). Here we show that, across 210 realizations of socioeconomic and climate scenarios, vigorous (moderate) warming increases global climate-exposed energy demand before adaptation around 2050 by 2558% (1127%), on top of a factor 1.72.8 increase above present-day due to socioeconomic developments. We find broad agreement among ESMs that energy demand rises by more than 25% in the tropics and southern regions of the USA, Europe and China. Socioeconomic scenarios vary widely in the number of people in low-income countries exposed to increases in energy demand.

That cleavage site totally changes the orientation of the binding domain of COVID, so where before it could not see the ACE2 receptor which is the human receptor, it totally changes the orientation now so it has high affinity for human receptors. So that furin cleavage site bothered me, it didn't seem like it belonged there.   >And then if you look at the sequences they use in those 12 nucleotides for arginine, where the arginine sequence nucleotide triplet were coded for humans. So why did it have the arginine coding for humans and not bat? It was very disconcerting to me.

WIV use BsaI and BsmBI/Esp3I sites before to make synthetic WIV1 variants.

SARS2 is clearly synthetic!  **Type Ils restriction sites prove a synthetic origin**  Synthetic RNA viruses are assembled at the DNA level and later transcribed. 30,000 nucleotides cannot be synthesized in one go. These viruses are therefore assembled from smaller, 2- 8,000 nucleotide long pieces. Specific DNA restriction sites are often added to later reassemble the individual building blocks in the correct order. It is also technically possible to hide these interfaces (No See'em), but this was not done in the WIV.  In a 2017 paper, two very specific, particularly suitable type Ils restriction enzymes were used at the WIV. These have the advantage that they can produce different DNA overhangs (sticky ends), which are crucial for a correct assembly of the complete genome: Bsal and BsmBI.  SARS2 shows a Bsal and BsmBI restriction site pattern which is ideal for assembling synthetic viruses and to later replace the spike protein or furin cleavage site.  Bsal and BsmBI restriction sites also exist in closely related viruses (Banal20-52, RaTG13), but these are distributed in such a way that an artificial virus could never be generated using the methods established at WIV 2018/19.   **The probability that the required 5 synonymous mutations, which enable a synthetic assembly of SARS2, arose purely by chance is less than 1 in 10^20 or about as likely as winning the lottery jackpot 3 times in a row.**  Dr. Valentin Bruttel  https://twitter.com/VBruttel/status/1566365635680124929?t=koDQ9poynY6I9qSchgQAnw&s=19

Under[ uti possidetis juris](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2745094), Israel was the only country to arise out of 1948. Therefore, they are the only country to be able to inherit the prior administration's borders.  Applying uti possidetis juris, it was never Palestinian land.  Contrary to your prior assertion that Zionism was meant to kick the Arabs off, they had intended to live in peace. The intention of pre 1948 Zionism was to find a home for Jews when conditions were rapidly deteriorating in Europe and the ME, and to fulfill the multi-generational dream of returning to the promised land.  You might think there are religious overtones here, but pre 1948 Zionism was mostly secular, and some Jews were beginning to see the dangers of being stateless.  It was never Palestinian land to begin with even without uti possidetis juris. Before Israel, it was the British Mandatory Palestine. Before the British, it was the Ottoman Empire.  Buying land and immigration are perfectly viable ways of land acquisition.  >EVERY movement has crazies and outliers who say terrible things, why are we painting the entire movement as bad because a few people took it too far?

Israel is not indiscriminately bombing, and they are not committing as many war crimes as you think.  >It has quite literally nothing to do with the Jews, why is antisemitism the constant argument??  Because a lot of what Israel does is compliant with international law. Israel is often the only country targeted out for stuff they didn't do, and there are countries that are way worse. Not even North Korea gets this much hate.  That leads to the thinking that because the most common accusations don't actually hold any water, the world singles out Israel because they hate Jews.

The Log Cabin Republicans, being surprised every time they are ignored/slighted/etc.  Women that are shocked when they lose access to medical services.  People originally born in other nations when they find themselves on a deportation list.  The story again and again reoccurs - someone in a minority groups votes Republican, and gets treated exactly as Republicans claim they will be treated.  Leopards eating faces, etc.  And they are surprised.  I've been thinking about that for awhile.  About how that sort of mindset can come into existence.  It seems obvious - don't vote for people that promise to hurt you.  And yet, here we are, again.  Something that has been sitting with me for awhile is "our values are their tools".  This is the group that screams for Freedom of Speech, then goes about banning books and limiting speech they don't like.  They are pro-gun, unless it is minorities being armed.  Respect the Office of the President, unless it's the other guy.  So on and so forth, I could heap examples of apparent hypocrisy into this comment.  Except that it isn't hypocrisy exactly, because those things they espouse are not their values.  They don't value free speech, they use it.  It's a tool.  *We* value it.  They use it.  Pick it up to do the job, and when it is the wrong tool for the job, set it down and pick up another.  Demand free speech when they want to say horrible things, demand censorship when it is something they don't like.  It's a tool, not a value.  What do they value then?  Power.  Control.  Domination.  Feeling superior.  Or in summary: To be above everyone else.  That's their only observable core value.  Everything else serves that function.  So to circle back around, if you are part of this group, you either consciously or subconsciously accept that the things that are said are not what are meant.  You can go to the rally that screams for 2nd amendment rights, understanding that they don't mean it - if we start a national "Guns for Minorities" free giveaway, they would *lose their minds*.  So much for that 2A rally, right?  They know that none of these things are serious.  That there is no shouted stance that has any meaning... from their perspective.  So they scream for anti-abortion laws, knowing that it won't happen, it's just a tool.  And racism, and homophobia, and and and.  Because they know it's just about crushing the other team, not about the words.  Except - and here's where the leopards lick their chops - it is about those issues too.  You've got one voter that doesn't care about the racism or the homophobia or any of that and just really loves his guns.  So from his perspective, the racism, et al, is the tool while the guns are the value.  A different voter couldn't give a fig about the guns and is all-in for the homophobia.  That voter knows the gun-bit isn't serious because of all the things they've seen.  The homophobia is where it is at.  These two voters watch the same media sources and hear the same speeches and are equally excited - but have completely different stances.  They've been conditioned to think all the bits they don't like or don't agree with are just tools - and can be ignored.  They are there just to "trigger the libs", as it were.  &#x200B;  Where you have problems then is when these different sub-groups with their contrary values interact directly.  General rallies, for example.  The rally for anti-abortion is curated - far less overlap.  But the "Republican Social" is a free-for-all.  The overlapping groups that thought they were one-team, get to meet.  And now you have a surprised black, gay Republican.  &#x200B;  Just my thought on it.  It's really quite a complicated idea, one that has sat badly with me for some time. Why would someone vote against their own interests?

We know that it causes warming by physics.  We further have very substantial pieces of evidence, with for instance the close track of CO2 and temperature in ice cores over the past several hundred thousand years (with CO2 leading temperature changes globally, mind you, despite the appearance of a lag the other way around when only looking at southern cores), or also the cause of the PETM, which prove that CO2 causes global warming.  Peculiarities of certain snowball Earth episodes do not present evidence against physics, they only highlight how there can be more factors at play.  You may have your datasets mixed up a bit, but there have certainly been times when there was high CO2 and extensive sea ice or ice sheets.  The late Ordovician is a good example of where several other factors would be at play.  For instance, the Sun at that time was at a younger stage in its life, and had lower total irradiance.  Also, the continental arrangement was different, and that impacts ocean heat transport poleward, and impacts sensitivity of that transport to other factors.  Some more recent ocean modeling attempts like [Pohl et al. (2014)](https://www.clim-past.net/10/2053/2014/cp-10-2053-2014.pdf) try to investigate the possibility that with that arrangement, there may be a tipping point where glaciation starts at a higher CO2 concentration than we may otherwise expect.  Furthermore, the CO2 record during the late Ordovician nonetheless matches our general understanding of causality, namely that when CO2 was drawn down, glaciation followed, and then when CO2 increased following the covering of silicate rocks by ice (preventing erosion by CO2), deglaciation followed.  [Young et al. (2010)](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/f/94/files/2014/05/youngetal_2010-1j65zq1.pdf) document that.

Do you have any examples of Palestinian mass displacement before they declared war in 1947?  Its common knowledge that what the Zionists wanted was a state, and unlimited immigration. Again colonization, but I dont think we agree there. Ben-Gurion wanted and asked for 80% of the land mass, he got 50% from the UN. Less than 30% of the population got half the land, and the more valuable land at that. You also didnt mention why the British left the issue to the UN in the first place.  We could go on and on about pre-48, however for brevity, I want to focus on the most subtle and egregious implication you are making. Its an idea that is responsible for a great portion of the moral decay in Israel. You seem to think a war justifies theft. When the Germans were defeated, they where not dumped out of Germany. When Japan was defeated, they were not settled or deported. The West was cheering.cheering, when the Soviet Union de-occupied east Germany.   In contrast, Ben-Gurion systematically stole land from individual non-combatant Palestinians, en mass, and settled immigrants into their homes, or else demolished villages and built over them. This is what we like to call colonizationnot war, because thats precisely colonization. This nonchalant attitude towards colonization extends to later on to when the West Bank was occupied in 1967. Because of the mystical, messianic entitlement complex behind Zionism, Israel began the process of colonizing the West Bank with settlers, and turning the people there into the human cattle they are today. This ongoing history is a moral disgrace that stems from the fact that Israel has built the mitigation and denial of its past firmly into the culture.   -  Yiddish includes Hebrew as a central component and is written with Hebrew letters, I wish you would read about this stuff before opining on it. Ashkenazi Jews spoke Hebrew too or they wouldn't even be able to read the Torah, but they decided that Hebrew should be reserved for sacred religious usage and Yiddish would be the language for secular life. It's just silly for you to be talking about indigenous languages and cultures and then acting like Saudi Arabic is more indigenous to the Levant than Canaanite Hebrew.  Here I cant tell if you are trying to be misleading. Yiddish is 80% a blend of European languages, mostly German, with, as you say, a substantial Hebrew vocabulary component. It is classified linguistically as a Germanic language, not a Semitic one. And even Yiddish, was nowhere near universally understood by European Jews.   Finally Hebrew itself was a dead language..period. In the way that Latin is dead. We know some Latin phrases, and if you are catholic you may hear it in mass, but few know it, and nobody thinks they can go back and resurrect Rome. The original Romans are gone. You say people knew Hebrew but chose not to use it.lol well to paraphrase the founder of modern Zionism, Theodore Herzlwho can so much as order a train ticket in Hebrew? You are basically either unaware, or lying. Even in the time of Jesus, the spoken language was Aramaic.   Finally as to Saudi Arabic? This is a laughable statement. The Saud royal family is a modern entity. Arabic, while it has drifted from its classical form, is still, and always has been, a living language. Its structurally a Semitic language, like Aramaic or Hebrew. The Arabs, and frankly the converted, now Muslim, Israelite peoples, and unconverted Arab Jews, have been speaking it possibly for longer than Hebrew was ever a living language.      As to the subjects of the US and Ireland, I'm surprised you don't seem to be aware that there are 60 million Americans today claiming to be Irish colonists living on lands their ancestors stole through genocide, according to pro-Palestinian logic. If the Holocaust isn't an excuse for Jews to return from forced exile to their ancestral homelands, then what's Ireland's excuse, a lack of potatoes? Talk about insulting.  Lol. Here we go I live in America. Irish Americans live in America. You will be hard pressed to find a single American who walks around today justifying what happened to the native peoples. We understand our colonial history. We dont excuse it. We try to learn from it. Its easy for us, because as a multi ethnic country, we dont tie our nations past atrocities with our spiritual or ethnic identities. This is a perverse aspect of ethnic nationalism. The USA has a right to exist, just like Israel has a right to exist. Israel just has not grown up from the colonial morality that gave birth to it. So it keeps doing it. You need to snap out of it.    Ahh but you wont. It is what it is.

The two scenarios have two very different levels of danger. They do not equate.   Im not a military tactician or a military lawyer. These arent random airstrikes in Gaza. They are checked over and signed off for legality by military lawyers outside IDF command structure. They have to make sure the airstrikes are legal under international laws, the Geneva Convention and their own policies about compliance. These lawyers do not answer to IDF generals so they cannot be swayed by them, but they do answer to the international Courts and can be arrested if their targets were just for civilian casualties instead of military targets. So there is incentive to be accurate with the bombings. They utilize the proportional balancing test to determine if the incidental injury, including deaths to civilians and damage to civilian objects, is excessive in relation to the military advantage expected to be gained.   If the US had drones back in 1993, maybe they would have their aerial targets but the operation was to aid in the capture of one person that ended up being the rescue of several US personnel to the DMZ, not a rescue of 200 civilians and the destruction of a terrorist organization thats a threat to USs national security and its citizens. Their aerial defenses were shot down and their pilots killed and paraded around. Yes, I thinks drones would have been a great advantage back then. The purpose of them is to reduce boots on the ground in the first place. However, would they have been utilized is a matter of if or if not their use violated US policy regarding compliance with the law of armed conflict and a violation of the law of armed conflict itself.

You referred to "most of those cases never went before a judge" This is correct, and the reason it didn't go before every judge is because 30 out of 60 caes (rough estimate) other judges looked at these cases in detail and said they weren't legit as there is zero evidence to warrant a case. AND some of those cases never got to a judge to review because the people who Brought these cases actually pulled them themselves. This is fact.  Think about it, if some one has a dispute/case they can and do bring it to a reasonable amount of courts/judges (which they did) but if 50 judges decide there's not enough evidence you can't just keep bringing these cases to other judges in the hope one might have a different opinion.  They will go off the bases that 30 judges etc already looked into it and it's wasting the courts time for more judges to look into it again and again and again. This is standard. Look it up

We are opposed to the legalization of prostitution. However we must combat human trafficking which harms the lives of young women and foster organized crime. 3. This is a mixed issue. We are mostly open to immigration however we prefer immigrants with societal views similar to our own. Guest worker programs are useful to make up for a lack of domestic employment in specific sectors but the national people must always come first. As an American I am opposed to illegal immigration and want more restrictions on the southern border. That said families should not be ripped apart and a pathway to citizenship should be made for working illegals with no criminal record.. 4. Building off point #3 we are once again open to refugees but this must be strictly controlled. As we've seen over the last decade uncontrolled immigration has damaged native cultures and increased crime rates in developed European nations. This is completely unacceptable. Assimilation of the migrants should be expected if they wish to stay in their host countries.  5. I personally don't take issue with women working in the workplace.

And you can atleast understand that anyone under oppression will want freedom.  In the other hand we have Israel that had to do what was necessary, the occupation of the west bank, while awful and tragic, is strategically important, it negates the possibility of Israel being cut in half in the event of a war with its neighbors that have tried to destroy it from its very beginning, so neighbors they can't trust. And while the blockade of Gaza is also tragic, they really didn't have a choice in the matter, its governing body has publicly said that they would kill every Jew they could their hands on. As a state, Israel's primary responsibility is the safety of its citizens even at the cost of oppressing the hostile state and its civilians, thus blockading the strip was the right choice, in hopes of preventing shipment of weapons and espionage in their own territory.  Once Gaza has been occupied, they will keep the border and add even more security to it, because in the eyes of Israel the Palestinians can't be trusted and you can understand why they would think that, majority of the Gazan population are minors, minors who have been conditioned to hate Israel with a passion, and the occupation will only get worse, in the eyes of the Palestinians they are being occupied and they will fight back attacking the occupiers, by what means? I cannot say, but this will only keep tightening the noose around Gaza's neck, its going to be a cycle of tightening the occupation and the local militia or whatever slowly growing because of it.     As for a solution? I'm thinking of 2, Israel could try to break the cycle of violence, try a loose hold on the occupation, treat the civilians with dignity and not to treat them as second class citizens, this COULD break the cycle of violence, the probability  is unlikely. The 2nd one is to turn Gaza into an autonomous region with its own government under Israeli supervision, build infrastructure, improve quality of life, in addition build schools that teach the normal things people are supposed to learn in school without HAMAS agenda, without the "Kill the occupiers" part, and in addition with religious tolerance part, the only thing Israel needs to do is to nail that part and HOLD ON TO GAZA, no matter how many attacks they endure within the strip, they need to last long enough for the next generation of Palestinians that don't want to kill them. Because if they leave again there will be another HAMAS and we will all be right back where we started.     Ofcourse this is an oversimplification of what happened and what could happen, but I'm all ears for any criticism.

The message was sent thiough, and I think the IDF scrapped plans to bomb Beirut after it was done with Gaza.    U.S. Intelligence came out and in a rare public rebuke, straight up told Israel they were likely to lose a war with Hezbollah right now.

Dissolved iron is quickly lost from the ocean, but its availability to marine microbes may be enhanced by binding with organic molecules which, in turn, are produced by microbes. We hypothesize this forms a reinforcing cycle between biological activity and iron cycling that locally matches the availability of iron and other nutrients, leading to global-scale resource colimitation between macronutrients and micronutrients, and maximizing biological productivity. Idealized models support this hypothesis, depending on the specific relationships between microbial sources and sinks of organic molecules. An evolutionary selection may have occurred which optimizes these characteristics, resulting in just enough iron in the ocean.  **Abstract**  Iron is the limiting factor for biological production over a large fraction of the surface ocean because free iron is rapidly scavenged or precipitated under aerobic conditions. Standing stocks of dissolved iron are maintained by association with organic molecules (ligands) produced by biological processes. We hypothesize a positive feedback between iron cycling, microbial activity, and ligand abundance: External iron input fuels microbial production, creating organic ligands that support more iron in seawater, leading to further macronutrient consumption until other microbial requirements such as macronutrients or light become limiting, and additional iron no longer increases productivity. This feedback emerges in numerical simulations of the coupled marine cycles of macronutrients and iron that resolve the dynamic microbial production and loss of iron-chelating ligands. The model solutions resemble modern nutrient distributions only over a finite range of prescribed ligand source/sink ratios where the model ocean is driven to global-scale colimitation by micronutrients and macronutrients and global production is maximized. We hypothesize that a global-scale selection for microbial ligand cycling may have occurred to maintain just enough iron in the ocean.

When one looks at the deaths caused by drought and then compares that with economic losses, something seems awry. Are they not counting loss of productivity due to deaths? It makes sense that storms and flood would be devastating economically, but if droughts cause such significant amount of deaths as well, it seems like they should also cause a fair amount of economic harm in the form of a decrease in productivity in both the near and long term. This lack of productivity could be mediated by the fact that more "at-risk" individuals die rather than the standard workforce, but children dying would cause some longer term economic damage.

Buying an EV and switching over to a heatpump or similar electric heating/cooling is something people ultimately need to do and doing it sooner is a good thing.

What I can say right now, in general about the technology, is the following. Please excuse any typos (writing this on my phone as I watch the NCAA championship game I've recorded). If I've left anything out, or you'd like any references etc, please let me know.  Spark combustion fuels can be produced both through natural and man-made processes. The idea for synthesis is that we take abundant stuff in nature (water, CO2, etc.), add a ton of energy in an intelligent manner, and we end up with synthesized fuels that we can use to power vehicles.   The common problem is the "add energy" part. If we were to use fossil fuels to provide that energy, we would put about as much, if not more, CO2 into the atmosphere than we gain from making the fuel, resulting in a net loss... we end up emitting more GHGs than saving. But, if we were to use any emission-free energy source to provide that energy for the process, then it would be carbon neutral (very nearly). This is an EXCELLENT opportunity to use intermittent emission-free sources like wind and solar, because instead of causing blackouts or grid damage during fluctuations (the Sun isnt always shining and the wind isn't always blowing at constant rates), they just produce more or less of this fuel during the synthesis process. No worries there. So, intermittent emission-free energy used in this way is a legitimate, sustainable path to moving a vehicle down the road in an emission-neutral manner. Of course, baseload emission-free sources, like nuclear, could provide this energy in a more predictable manner, but we will probably need to prioritize that for the grid where the match of energy supply and demand is critical.  From your original post, I would be remiss if I didn't point out a couple of things about the topic of EVs.  They are a neat idea, but like all popular scientific phenomena, there's a massive catch that those who are biased intentionally avoid discussing. When used, EVs do indeed decrease the carbon footprint (even on fossil fuel-based grids like we have in the US) due to their higher efficiency in comparison to a standard combustion engine...  BUT...  EVs will never replace combustion engines. This isn't a prediction. There literally isn't enough raw materials (cobalt, lithium, etc.) on the planet to do it (unless a complete paradigm shift in battery technology occurs). It's trivial math. For example, look at the kg/kWh of cobalt needed to make a transportation-viable battery, then multiply by the number of vehicles we predict to have in the next decade or two (2-3 billion). The mass required exceeds the terrestrial amount available to us.  Long story short, combustion and electric vehicles (assuming   robust global recycling programs) are here to stay, and they can (and will, someday) both be done in a carbon-neutral, economical manner.

It will affect literally everything, and the effects we can predict and observe are almost completely deleterious to ecosystems as we have come to rely on them. There will be new openings and new population movements and a lot of phenological shifts, so it's not just mass animal death or whatever, but these are big disruptive changes, and some critters won't keep up with the pace of change. Ecology's iron law is that you can never change just one thing - a pull or push in the web one place will be felt in all places.

The situation in the west bank is very complex, frankly sometimes even more then i fully comperhand.   As far as im aware the use of militery courts is for 2 reasons:  1) the areas controlled by israel in the west bank fall under militery jurasdiction.  2) you need israeli citizenship in order to be in civillian court. For example, if an arab israeli commits a crime, they go to civillian court not militery court   3) expediency? Some security concern or regulation. Im frankly also abit confused about this.  This natrually, does not really apply in the west bank as the idf basically is the arm of israeli law. Im not sure israel can even legally process people from the west bank through a civillian courts.

It seems to counter-productive to our goals, espcially when sosciety is specifically looking for ways to improve and shifts are already happening around the world where citizens, schools, and organizations are making changes.  It'd be great to see what options we have to living greener lifestyles and spreading the idea that it isn't totally futile as some would like us to believe. The argument I hear is that one person can't make a difference, but if we can build numbers and momentum, then the possitive impacts we are capable of will only multiply.  Suggestions:  * Support public transportation - if you don't have access, start making some noise so that the powers that be know there's interest in public transit.  * Limit waste - avoid single use plastic and find ways and products that will help you, your family, business, community, school go waste free.  * Transition to a plant-based lifestyle to avoid unnecessary green house gasses, land usage, water waste, deforestation, algea blooms, etc.  * Support education, particularly for girls, sex ed, and provide access to birth control.   * Join and/or support your local charities, parks, and preserves. Help de-trash, plant new trees, or do outreach to get others interested in what's left of our local environments. People can't care about what they don't know is around them.  People aren't going to jump in and get involved if they think this is a hopeless cause or there's nothing one person can do. Getting involved is the best way to spread the word and give yourself a give you tangible proof that your actions can improve the world around you. Much better than everyone just waiting for someone else to swoop in and save the day.

CSIS and ASPI are think tanks that is very pro war and funded by weapons manufacturers.  ASPI has been criticized by Australian government itself for its warmongering stance and anti-China narratives.  Think tanks arent exactly neutral and objective in their reporting; most are essentially propaganda arms of whoever funds them.  Adrian Zenz has been criticized by his European colleagues for a multitude of issues, starting with the fact that he was never a Sinologist.  Zenz started his work as a theological scholar publishing various evangelist Christian works.  He himself even admitted to have only visited Xinjiang once as a tourist.  His work on China is often laced with anti-China and religious overture.  As other Sinologists have said, there are many more credible and experienced scholars in Sinology, why go to Zenz for pieces about Uryugar genocide.  Well I do believe there are abuse by the Chinese authorities in the region, we cant forget that the East Turkestan Islamic Movement is active in Xinjiang and is listed as a terrorist organization by both the U.S. and UN.  I believe the Chinese authorities should have a right to clamp down on terrorist activities like how the West have the same right too?

Okay, that at least is more understandable than what I previously understood- but its still obviously wrong. I've seen your argument from some people who genuinely meant it, but most people recognize that "compare the bad things that happened to each side" is not a good way of measuring things:  1. Russia goes to war against China, Kazakhstan and North Korea. Soldiers from China and Kazakhstan rape Russian women. Russia counts and announces that 600,174 women were raped, and as a result they have instructed the Russian army to rape 300,087 Chinese women and 300,087 Kazakhstanis. 2. Same war. Russia fully conquers and subdues Kazakhstan. They announce that they've counted and if you add up all the dead, Russia lost 200,000 more soldiers, so they'll be executing the same number of Kazakhstani soldiers to make things "equal".  Rape is never justified- there is no good reason to rape. By contrast, killing people is also immoral, but we recognize it as a necessary evil in a world with violent people. You measure whether a cause is justified, and then you measure how many people have to die before you no longer support that cause. And that's a complicated calculation and people will come to different conclusions.

This will have several results beyond the obvious starvation issues. It creates internal strife by forcing different factions within Gaza to compete and fight over food, and that division itself will result in many more deaths. Starvation also depresses immune systems, which along with the cold and lack of drinkable water and water for basic sanitation needs will dramatically increase disease. This will hurt Hamas fighters and reduce their fighting effectiveness, but the civilian casualty toll will be horrendous. This is almost certainly baked in, tens if not hundreds of thousands will die in the upcoming month or two, and even if Israel allowed full resumption of water, food, and power imports into Gaza most of those deaths are now inevitable. It takes a lot of logistical machinery to move enough food, water, power, medicine, etc, into  a compact area with over two million people crammed into it, and that machinery has been destroyed by the IDF.

Politically, I'm fiercely independent but in my younger days was firmly in the left camp. And by left, I mean actual leftist. Anti corporate, anti government, leaning anarchist (anarcho-socialist), emma Goldman, Lysander Spooner, Conquest of bread, battle for Blair mountain type left. That left barely exists anymore and actual leftists need to police the "leftists" a hell of a lot more. They wear leftism like a fuckin t shirt they bought in a store.   I agree with pretty much everything you said. However, as I said, nowadays I'm pretty independent. I find value in many different ideologies. I'd say nationalism isn't as bad as you think it is when you factor in Trans national corporations. What's the alternative to nationalism? A borderless, corporate, globalist system, dictated by men in board rooms. Which, if you're perceptive, isn't at all much different than what we currently have. So nationalism, in its current form, seems to be a push back against that corporate globalism. I'd say you could make an argument for georgism or resource based economies, but good luck explaining that to the average person. A borderless, anarchist utopia would be nice, but nationalism allows for self determination as opposed to being ruled by some faceless, corporate behemoth with no loyalty (in theory...).   The only other thing I'd push back on is classifying rightwingers as narrow-minded, or lacking worldly experience. I've met plenty of right wingers who've traveled the US, been over seas, have seen things that shape their opinions on why they think America is great. Many right wingers spend way more time in nature than a lot of people leaning left, although it depends. Imo, I've met more right wingers who have walked on deer trails than paved trails. Don't be fooled by what the media portrays as right wingers. The same is easily said about how Fox News portrays certain parts of the US.   Again, I agree with damn near everything you said. Voting is useless and democracy is basically just tyranny of the Masses, if it can actually be implemented. And even then, the media is so effective and warping people's minds, even if we had "true" democracy, they would probably just be able to manipulate ppl however they want....much like they currently do.   Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. I love you all.

Consider:  - Unless the ill employee requires treatment (not the case 99% of the time re: the flu/cold/GI ailments which account for the vast majority of sick days), there's no good reason to have them take up a physician's valuable time to write a note.    - Going to the physician to get a note as opposed to getting treatment exposes others to contagions.   - The physician almost always relies entirely on the employee's self-report re: the note, so this does nothing to prevent "abuse" of the system (to the extent that taking a mental health or personal day can properly be characterized as such). In any event, medical providers are not the "sick day police" for the benefit of employers, and using them as such is inappropriate in any healthcare system.

USA!" and military parades (full disclosure: I am a veteran) with flags, red-white-and-blue imagery and pictures of Donald Trump are too far removed from Nazi Germany (Hitler), Fascist Italy (Mussolini) or fascist Spain (Franco) in their adulation of a "strongman."  I don't think that the Confederacy ever truly re-integrated into the Union.  Ever since Nixon's "southern strategy," the hardline, bow-to-authority mentality so prevalent in the South (full disclosure: my maternal grandparents were from Kentucky and Tennessee) has been spreading.  In fact, I will go so far as to say the Confederacy never truly ended; it just went dormant, waiting for someone to come along and tell them that their racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, theocratic, authoritarian views were "acceptable."  Donald Trump did that.  This has been festering like a boil for *decades*. Trump lanced the boil.  If you have not read "The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich" by William L Shirer, I suggest you do.

In fact, the only possible (not likely) 1 state "solution" is Israel takes the whole show. But that isn't happening either because ethic cleansing is bad and no country wants the Palestinians to come on in.

The media is doing a terrible job because the election being close means clicks. Democracy be damned.   There economy is strong. Things are still rough post covid, which was a global issue. The US had lower inflation then any G7 country. So instead of talking about how we feel as compared to typical years, we should talk about how the US is doing better than pretty much any other nation in the face of the global economic rough patch that was always going to happen when you shut down the supply chain for a year.   But the media is focused on the fact that a reduction of inflation, low unemployment, and a soaring such market don't "feel" like a strong economy to many. The real story is that those are all signs of a strong economy that were not even remotely guaranteed, and a sustained strong economy will lead to a better economic situation for everyone.   "We avoided economic collapse and things are stabilizing after the covid pandemic. US leads the way in strong economic markers as the world economy recovers". There. That's the headline.

What I want to know is, how many states actually go by the federal minimum? I am from the Northeast, and I know that New Hampshire does not have its own minimum so it goes by the federal minimum wage. That being said, pretty much no companies seem to pay that low. Any job Ive seen, like fast food places, are offering well over $10/hour, as high as $14 last I saw on a Wendys sign. New England is more expensive than other places though, and competition between employers probably drives the wages up. But there are bound to be states and areas where employers can get away with paying the federal minimum. It shudder at the thought of trying to live on that.

I see a lot of people in this sub promoting it when if kind of opposes some CD philosophy.  What really gets me is in some big tent progressive/leftist spaces they will actually support Distributism thinking it is a viable alternative to capitalism that isnt as bad as socialism.  Distributism honestly seems like the most reactionary economic system out there to me. The entirety of it is opposing any social welfare, the Industrial Revolution, and federalism in favor of a system that is reminiscent of feudalism. It is heavily reliant on agrarianism and the Church. Self reliance is a huge part of distributism. It kind of reminds me of the Luddites who opposed industrialization.  I know in the 1930s there was a fascist 3rd party that supported it, but I cant remember its name.  Id be more supportive of the ASP if it were to move into a direction that wasnt so extreme. The Social Market economy is more proven at creating a flourishing economy with strong protections for vulnerable citizens. But this ideology is pure Catholic Traditionalism at its most extreme.  Im not shitting on people here who believe in it, these are just my opinions.

Primarily, the projects are extremely costly (multiple billions per reactor site), take years to plan/approve/build, can be perceived negatively by the public, depend on complex technical systems, and need specialized personnel who are in short supply. Nuclear accidents can also cause catastrophic environmental issues and operations generate radioactive waste which is difficult to store and dispose of (spent fuel rods and contaminated water, mainly). Reactor and station design is not standardized within countries, much less internationally, and monitoring is required to ensure safety procedures are followed. A lot of water is required to operate them for cooling and steam generation.  On the other hand, fuel is abundant, e.g. Uranium in seawater, operations don't generate carbon waste, and they provide great baseload generation. Fuel can also be reprocessed and there has been loads of technical progress. They are extremely compact and efficient for the amount of power generated.  Renewable projects are just far cheaper to scale and bring online though. Installing solar panel grids and wind turbines is orders of magnitude cheaper and less complicated than commissioning nuclear plants.

Post Chesterton's Death the links between the two became stronger.   >As for the Americans supporting both ideologies together, I'd argue that it is the result of an Anglosphere development, as Christian democracy in the continental European sense never arose in the Anglosphere on its own, mostly because it never needed to.  100% agree.

The first Democratic Labor party in Australia drew from the well of European Christian Democracy and English Distributism. The current Democratic labour party still retains much of the economic policy that resulted from this. Even the Catholic Social Guild, which was an English Christian Democratic group organized around Chesterton's time, began to adopt more Distributist ideas as time went on.  >A hypothesis I have is that when CD did rise in Anglospheric countries like the United States, it latched onto it distributist principles, since they likely hit closer to home, due to distributism being an inherently Anglo-Catholic ideology  Also 100% agree.

And to be totally clear - there is a religious aspect of Zionism. I dont agree with that aspect. But Zionism mostly is a secular movement. It had very little support until the 1920s when antisemitism became extremely harsh in Europe.  But it is important to understand that a big part of why they wanted that land is because they believed it wouldnt be a big deal to take. Israel didnt want all of the land initially. In fact, the original migrants asked England for a piece of land the size of a tablecloth.   They thought theyd be able to peacefully set up there because it was the most densely populated land in the world, and there was no sense of unity or nationality within the people of that land. They all operated as individual tribes and had no desire for an independent state. The idea of being Palestinian people didnt even exist for them.  When Jews began migrating, (legally, and legally buying land, mostly from Arabs who already lived there), many of the people there began forming the Palestinian identity because they didnt want Jews having an independent state in the Middle East. One of the original leaders of the Palestinian movement said something along the lines of Jews suck the blood of the land where they live. The Europeans didnt want them, and we dont want them either. Another Palestinian leader would go on to say that there was no Palestinian identity, and that it only existed as a resistance movement to Jewish sovereignty. He acknowledged publicly that there was no desire for a Palestinian state, and that Palestine would combine into one state with Jordan and Syria as soon as the Jews were gone.  Im not saying the Jews have been picture perfect. Specifically, fundamentalist Jews have been scum of the earth, and the Israeli right-wing has been awful to Arabs of the West Bank.  But its important to understand the true history here. Jews wanted a small piece of land to self govern for safety. They initially accepted a partition that gave mostly swampland and desert - areas where Arabs had never shown any interest in inhabiting. Arabs refused that deal, and then started a war, which Israelis won. Jews then pushed Arabs out of neighboring/bordering villages out of fear or violence, and have since offered multiple two state solutions in hopes of peace. None of been accepted by the Palestinian people.

A 9% to 20% loss in support of 2020 Trump voters is monumentally bad.

But I think the point of the Rafah op has skipped over a lot of peoples heads, the point of capturing the crossing with Egypt ensures it is that much harder for Hamas to slip away.   That was the biggest issue in Afghanistan it's not that the Taliban could not be defeated it's that they couldn't be actively stopped from sneaking off and operating outside of Pakistan.   That's not to say the idea of the Taliban could ever be wiped away but their ability to wage conflict or ensure any sort of control or influence could have been severely curbed.   The same thing goes for Hamas except their operating area is way smaller and more confined it's now even more confined. So do I think a full scale of Rafah is necessary no not at all control the Rafah crossing and begin doing raids day in and out should just about do the trick allows the continued flow and supervision of aid getting to who needs it and also ensures nothing that doesn't need to be leaving leaves.

Its not moral, but the cost of Labour in China is cheaper because wages are less, and theres less protections for workers. Especially the labourers and low skilled.  - A much larger expertise base than many other countries (China has invested consistently in Nuclear over the years, meaning it has an active nuclear industry and supports the training of new engineers etc. a lot of the west has scaled down its nuclear and lost that expertise base.  - Money comes from state controlled banks. This is the Biggie. Because the states control the banks, they can set nominal interest rates, or offset the interest against other things, or just remove them entirely and have the money interest free. So much of the Wests overall costs come from loan interest.   On the issue of safety, its hard to say. But as mentioned before China has some of the best nuclear engineers (the U.K. and other countries often use Chinese expertise). So on that front they are going to be well informed.  But also, just because China rings of socialist authoritarianism, doesnt mean its anything like Russia in regards to costs and money saving. My experience of China is that they dont mess about with important stuff like this. Standards will be high.

Something more tangible than "People Joe knows made money!"      Well, it's a bit more direct than that. Hunter sold influence over "the big guy", who got a substantial cut of the profits. The reason so many people who Joe knows made money is that the money couldn't go straight from China to Joe, or even go China to Hunter to Joe. No, that would be way too obvious. So the money gets passed around various relatives, friends and associates of the Bidens, often through dummy companies related to same. But follow about a dozen money hops and you see the bunny trail leading from essentially (XI to JOE)  And THAT is exactly what the Hunter Biden deposition....a preparation to impeach Joe Biden...is all about.

I cannot comprehend how anyone can believe culture can coexist with this. Culture is not just food, language and festivals, it is much more. It must be passed down from parent to child in an environment that is conducive to transmitting the culture.

Sowing distrust in institutions via follow on media campaigns (I cant trust the government because they dont care about my data) and 3.

The whole sentiment is flatten Gaza, eradicate Hamas, human animals, there are no innocent civilians in Gaza, they are all terrorists, we told them were were gunna bomb them its there fault for dying theres no justification for any of this; let alone trying to use October 7th as a justification when Hamas could use Israels current argument to start this war to justify October 7th given all the Israeli aggression which occurred before October 7th, such as sniping down protesters and children. Also there is a lot of evidence that suggests october 7th was allowed to happen. Not only this but it's clear that the agenda on october 7th was not simply "kill, rape, cut off baby heads, take over Israel" which the media portrays this event as; the agenda was to take hostages in exchange for Palestinian "prisoners" who are clearly hostages as well since thousands of palestinians are arrested and held without due process or trial. Everything Israel claims about Hamas is so hypocritical since they themselves are playing the same game they claim to condemn.

A better question is, why doesn't Hamas just declare a safe zone, or several safe zones? I understand they have tunnels nearly everywhere, but why not relinquish some areas for the civilians they care so much about to be safe? As the de facto government in the Gaza Strip, this would allow their civilians to reside there while they fight it out, man to man, against the IDF. This way they can spare their civilians, humanitarian orgs can focus on providing relief, and Hamas can focus on fighting the IDF without fear of their civilians being caught in the crossfire?

As a parent of a trans kid, I'mma say I find a minority to be unacceptable, especially if the larger group is not denouncing  them. And as far as I can see, they do not denounce them, but instead use every opportunity to encourage that mindset. Making trans kids and people who support them seem like the number one most important issue in a world of real challenges we need to face up to is disgusting and dangerous.  In the Republican's response to the state of the union last night, the very first hit on Biden was "He doesn't even know what a woman is."

You say you want an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, but there already has been one, negotiated by Biden, and Hamas broke it. What would you have Biden do at that point?  And besides that, Hamas has just massacred 1200 Israelis and kidnapped 240, and they proudly declared they will do it again and again until Israel is destroyed. In this context, forcing a ceasefire that solidifies the status quo where Hamas is in control of the Gaza Strip and Israel doesnt trust it (for obvious reasons) will only serve to hurt everyone involved. When you say ceasefire now what youre essentially saying is that Biden must ignore these issues and just force a ceasefire that will ultimately lead to more wars and more suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians. I understand that to you these considerations seem pointless, but to Biden, as well as for Israel and the Palestinians, these are real issues that need addressing. When you say but Biden isnt doing what I want! youre ignoring the fact that this isnt about you and that there are other factors at play. And when you do that you signal that youre not serious. Why would the people in charge take your views into consideration when you obviously dont care about the nuances of the situation?  I dont expect you to reply or even read this but I wish people who hold your views would take this into consideration. We could get so much more done if people with your views actually took the time to understand whats happening instead of immediately blaming everyone else.

Although modelling, outcrop and proxy records suggest volcanic carbon release occurred, it has not yet been possible to identify the PETM trigger, or if multiple reservoirs of carbon were involved. Here we report elevated levels of mercury relative to organic carbona proxy for volcanismdirectly preceding and within the early PETM from two North Sea sedimentary cores, signifying pulsed volcanism from the North Atlantic Igneous Province likely provided the trigger and subsequently sustained elevated CO2. However, the PETM onset coincides with a mercury low, suggesting at least one other carbon reservoir released significant greenhouse gases in response to initial warming. Our results support the existence of tipping points in the Earth system, which can trigger release of additional carbon reservoirs and drive Earths climate into a hotter state.

In that vein, it isn't very surprising that many of the worst politicians we've had have so many parallels to things like the anti-christ.  Because anti-christ is literally just "the opposite of Christ".  If Christ is an example of desirable traits in a leader - empathy, compassion, wisdom, a resistance to temptation, a commitment to a cause - then the anti Christ is the opposite.  Loud, self-proclaiming, violent, obsessed with branding his own name and image into his followers, blasphemous, using the Lord and his virtues to further his own selfish agenda.  The anti-christ is an allegory for the type of ruler that will end a civilization, not for any supernatural reasons, but simply because that guy is an asshole and his pursuit of self will cause the collapse of any nation or organized body of people.  Technology may have changed but people largely have not.  The biblical era had all the same narcissistic, psycopathic, self-obseased power-hungry lunatics back then.  They simply packed the clinical and secular terminologies to describe them, as we do now, so they created allegories and myths to associate them.  That's all.  When looked at from that perspective it's really not surprising at all that the template of an autocratic idiot demogogue like Trump would bear so many similarities to the anti-christ.  Think about it another way: there were no methods in the Biblical era for people to adequately condemn a government, outside of religion and philosophy.  If I have a brain in my skull and recognize a King is bad for a nation, but I'm just a measley writer, I can't just say "yo guys this bro is a narcissist, let's overthrow him."  Instead, I tap into a mythological system of morals, a shared pantheon that can be understood, and one whose authority supercedes a king: God.  And within that pantheon, I describe the type of ruler God hates, one who represents all the worst aspects of mankind and will bring about an end to all civilization.    Lo and behold, that ruler looks a *lot* like this King I dislike. But I can always just shrug and say, "no I wasn't saying anything about the King, that's a future bad guy God is warning us about. ALL SIMILARITIES TO REAL INDIVIDUALS AND REAL EVENTS ARE A COINCIDENCE.

The Gem model in particular has a substantial area of spin being produced by this, but still shows a weak strength    So while this currently doesnt look serious, there are several reasons why I am nervous for this. One is this is going to be a last minute development situation, so we could see something intensifying on our doorstep. This is always the worst type of situations, because people think theres no threat, and then weve seen situations the pass several years (Laura, Ida, Ian, Harvey etc) where something blows up last second, and catches people offguard. Two, is that ridge/heat dome forecasted to intensify over the southern and eastern US this weekend into early next week, gives this area a pretty favorable upper pattern to see something strengthen, potentially rapidly in the right circumstances.  As with how warm the waters are this year, I could see this area potentially get more serious pretty quickly, even though thats currently not the expectation. We have to watch this very closely

The success and sustained effort of the pro life movement came from conservative women.   Though many American women mourned the loss of the national right to abortion, conservative women  and especially young women  had powered the movement against abortion and infused it with the fresh energy of a new generation.

It is taking away their right to engage in civic activities and the operation of government.   Here is why this does not change my view. My view is that the process worked in exactly the way that the framers of the prior legislation intended. The electorate is not the only one with tools to remedy a disqualified candidate running for office. However, the electorate has a more nimble instrument available in that they can declare a candidate disqualified to receive the electoral votes PRIOR to the assumption of those votes by the candidate. This works exactly as you saw in Colorado, where a single member or group of the electorate pulls a mechanical/procedural brake lever and forces a legal hearing where the candidate must prove that they are not disqualified. If the state cannot be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the candidate is NOT disqualified - then they protect the electorate by giving them exactly what they asked for.  Congress is logically the only other body with a lever to pull, but their tool is too blunt and is harmful to the entire electorate in that their tool could, actually, invalidate every single electoral vote awarded (assuming the disqualified candidate managed to win all electoral votes in the hypothetical...). Therefore, the state is in a position where they HAD OUGHT TO FAVOR the more nimble tool that protects their electorate in their state over the blunt remedy available only AFTER the harm to the electorate has occurred.  I can't say if the justices would have accepted this argument - but I think it is a terrible disservice to us - the electorate - that there was no one present to make the argument.

Its also the *coldest* part of the bottom 50-ish km of atmosphere!  The lower troposphere is warm because the surface is even warmer, and as that air rises it loses heat through radiation and convective processes until it levels out, advecting horizontally instead of continuing upwards*this* place is what we call the tropopause and its location may change depending on present atmospheric conditions. The tropopause is marked by strong horizontal winds due to this advection, and it also contains what we call the jet stream and other polar vortices of interest.  But why does the rising air level out? I thought the stratosphere was cold too!  It is! But its not as cold as the tropopause. Basically, the upper stratosphere and stratopause are right in that sweet spot where its just dense enough that certain relatively weak intensity radiation bands (UV) get mostly absorbed by free oxygen and ozone and converted into heat, yet sparse enough for that heat to raise the temperature significantly. When I say weak intensity, I mean UV is less than 5% of all light emitted from the sun. As a consequence of this heating, the bottom of the stratosphere is about 50C colder than the top, and there is no substantial vertical air movement because theres no reason for the air mass to try and invert itself like there is in the troposphere.  So to simplify, hot surface air rises, dumps heat and moisture until it reaches the tropopause, advects for a while as it bleeds off momentum, and then turns around because its now colder and denser than all of the air immediately above AND below it. The stratosphere does get knocked around by these winds, but the upright temperature gradient is enough to keep the layer relatively vertically stablemixing is localized to the bottom couple miles and its not a substantial source of temperature variation, since everythings just about the same temperature at that altitude.  I guess another way to think about this from a basic kinetics perspective is to think of the tropopause like a fast river perpendicular to your routeeven with a running start, all of your kinetic energy is going to get redirected by or lost to the prevailing movement of the faster fluid, much in the same way the momentum of a rising column of air is probably going to get shunted by tropopause air currents.

I certainly see good reason to do away with mandatory prison labor outside of, arguably, direct prison maintenance, as the incentives would seem to create too many opportunities of abuse, and I think far too many laws are open to prison sentences for people breaking them, but to equivocate between the mandatory labor of convicted criminals who receive a prison sentence and chattel slavery, I think, is unproductive at best.

I think you're just trying to be provocative because you don't think most people care about the issue as much as they should.

This is why the pope told catholics in near the black forest c. WWs I&II that it was not theft to take coal from state and corporate fuelyards. It's also why Pope Gregory and the Fathers describe alms as an act of justice, not mercy- in alms, we give what is _owed_, for it _belongs_ to the poor already. Hence the others quote of Basil.   Thomas Aquinas and Peter Damian are just two examples of those who explicitly state otherwise than your claim. In [II-II. Q66](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3066.htm), Aquinas says in cases of need, all things are common property; 'what appears as theft is not, for need has made it common.' In [Letter 142](https://www.cuapress.org/9780813226408/the-letters-of-peter-damian-121-150/), Damian concludes succinctly, "Therefore, he who takes from the rich to give to the poor is not to be thought a thief, but a dispenser of common property." Hence why I put "thieves" in quotation.

This appearance is not created by mere status alone, but comes because of specific conduct, and impacts more than a mere nebulous public interest because it concerns a public prosecutor. Blumenfeld, 247 Ga. at 410. Even if the romantic relationship began after SADA Wades initial contract in November 2021, the District Attorney chose to continue supervising and paying Wade while maintaining such a relationship. She further allowed the regular and loose exchange of money between them without any exact or verifiable measure of reconciliation. This lack of a confirmed financial split creates the possibility and appearance that the District Attorney benefited - albeit non-materially - from a contract whose award lay solely within her purview and policing. Most importantly, were the case allowed to proceed unchanged, the prima facie concerns raised by the Defendants would persist. As the District Attorney testified, her relationship with Wade has only cemented after these motions and is stronger than ever. Wades patently unpersuasive explanation for the inaccurate interrogatories he submitted in his pending divorce indicates a willingness on his part to wrongly conceal his relationship with the District Attorney. As the case moves forward, reasonable members of the public could easily be left to wonder whether the financial exchanges have continued resulting in some form of benefit to the District Attorney, or even whether the romantic relationship has resumed.

Haley called it "offensive" to give a "political speech" at the location.  "By all means, lets go after Joe Biden when in your own backyard you say nothing about Trump," Behar said of Haley. "We all know hes a racist. I mean, he was endorsed by the KKK."Behar pointed to Donald Trump's history of alleged racial discrimination, which resulted in a 1973 lawsuit against the future president.  Behar then turned her attention to young voters, with whom Biden has had an increasingly difficult time drumming up support.     "These young people dont understand a lot of things because theyre young," Behar said. "I dont know what happened before my time as much as I know in my lifetime."

Not exactly readings, but in my experience, listening to climate scientists who spend more time pondering and thinking about these issues and potential prospect in a day than I do in weeks, made me realize the situation, while is dire, is also not as apocalyptic as people on social media and a lot of mainstream sites indicate, and the issue is entirely solvable, and there are efforts to actively do so.  If you are specifically looking for research that are hopeful, a [recent paper](https://www.carbonbrief.org/melting-antarctic-ice-could-slow-global-temperature-rise-study) suggested that the meltwater from Antarctic could seriously delay the heating from global warming, another [paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/46/11700) that indicates the CaCO3 release from sediments in seafloor is causing the progress of ocean acidification to slow down. There are many, many more similar research that indicates there are things to be hopeful about, these ones are those that I just found from frontpage of carbonbrief.org (Which is a *great* news site about climate science) and from the top of my head.  There are a lot of reading, research, papers, and so on that are hopeful and very much indicate that what we are facing is not some predestined end point (muh great filter), but a problem that can be solved if we act accordingly, and we are partially doing, not enough, but it's wrong to say we are not doing anything and just waiting to die. To not sound too much like those people that talk about climate alarmism, this is something MSM seriously ignores, because sensationalist news about world ending will bring much more clicks than a reasonable article talking about causes and effects.

Another problem is that even though some areas are suffering flash floods, the water is often not being absorbed on the way down. So a place might have a dangerous amount of water for some days or weeks and then months and months of drought. It is very bad for the soil, it gets dry, doesnt get the moisture it needs for fertility and vegetation and then with flash floods the topsoil gets carried away and leaves even more eroded land.   I think we should be looking in many places to build something similar to the water projects that are being developed in India to harvest the water from the Monsoon and to fight water scarcity the rest of the year. IIRC its called watershed development or smth like that? They use permaculture ideas to let the water be absorbed slowly in the soil, feeding local vegetation and making ecosystems stronger. The water percolates through the soil and replenishes underground aquifers so that they can keep doing agriculture the whole year.

Hamas have zero morals/ethics (in the way that westerners would understand) and routinely sacrifice their own people, many of which have been brainwashed into thinking theyre martyrs and will go straight to heaven if they die in the service of killing Jews.  Militants in Gaza are disguised as civilians. Hamas has the optics game down, they know how to make Israel look like the aggressor even when Hamas is the one that broke the ceasefire on 10/7 in the most brutal way.  Meanwhile, Hamas leadership are all multi-billionaires (off of humanitarian aid meant for Palestinians) living in luxury in Qatar. Sometimes theyll come onto Lebanese TV and talk about how North Korea should nuke the US, but only in Arabic. They never say these dirty things in English.  Anyway, these tactics have been reported and verified all over the place for many years. Its nothing new.

Not too hard. Not too easy.     \* Climate Tech is the real-world example of a perfect game   \*\* Not too easy: Status quo/doing nothing  game over. There is a learning curve required to play the game. Not everyone can participate & win right off the bat.   \*\* Not too hard: It is possible to participate and win in the game. We know what it takes but it is getting progressively harder (the first GTs are easier than the last GTs).     \* The game designers (aka regulators) just released a new booster pack  IRA // grab the cheat codes while theyre hot      Bottomline: If you like a challenge and want to go after a real-world price  I hope this motivates at least one person to re-evaluate their career and participate in the Greatest Game

That was the [Wet Bulb-Globe Temperature](https://www.popsci.com/environment/wet-bulb-globe-temperature/), which helps measure how effectively the body can cool itself via evaporation (sweating, misting yourself with water, etc.). A few relevant excerpts from this article:  >Between 80 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit WBGT, working in the sun for more than around 30-45 minutes puts your body under serious stress. Above 88 WBGT, you can really only work or exercise outside for 20 minutes without putting yourself in peril. Above 90, you cant be active in the heat for more than 15 minutes. Getting into the 90s reaches a point where you really shouldnt be doing anything outside at all.  &#x200B;  >But theres a point at which sweat stops working: once the wet bulb temperature passes 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Thats because, in order to maintain a normal internal temperature, your skin has to stay at 95 degrees or below. Since sweating is your skins mechanism for shedding heat, and wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that a wet surface can achieve through evaporation (read: that sweaty skin can reach), wet bulb temperatures past 95 degrees are extremely dangerous. Sustained skin temperatures above 98 degrees are considered fatal.    The heat waves in Russia in 2010 and those across Europe in 2003 had wet bulb temperatures below 83 degrees Fahrenheit, just for reference. Around 55,000 and 35,000 people died in those heat waves, respectively.  &#x200B;  The OP also mentioned in a separate post that their city was at 48 Celsius, which is 118.4 Fahrenheit.  Conclusion: it real hot.

Edit: It's like people are saying "we need to change everything but everybody has to come to that conclusion on their own time, I'm not gonna help. People might dislike me for what I'm saying."

Locally and maybe regionally probably a sweet spot that makes parts of it a bit easier to address for most folks but it requires people who know and care about how to make a difference through and with their organizations and in a coordinated way at scale, ideally with it baked into the DNA of the organization/company -- which is super rare. But then the reality is that it's still a global issue too.   *For the bigger picture and macroeconomics:*  I'll start with some of the more tangible ones and then get into the more abstract stuff:  So much of the world's economic system is based on nonrenewable natural resources. If we pick just petroleum and it's related products, you have giant corporations which constantly lobby with a ratio of like 22 full time lobbyists per US senator to help them keep the laws in favor of fossil fuels. Then you also have the banking and financial industry which is also deeply tied to the petroleum industry and global conflicts for wars.  That's just a shallow summary of petroleum alone. I barely touched on how wallstreet markets and the price of crude oil are manipulated by big banks like Morgan Stanley/JP Morgan/Wells Fargo and the likes.  And there are entire states and countries which basically stake their economic existence on petroleum like Saudi Arabia's monarchy of many extraordinarily wealthy princes too, plus countries that rely on it as a significant part of their national and international strategies.    Capitalism by nature is about maximizing wealth exploitation. Our ideal alternative is something of a Regenerative economic system that rewards people putting good things back into the world like educating each other, taking care of each other and the environment, etc.  e.g. you voluntarily helped clean the trash water and air, and restored habitat with good trees for native wildlife/helped some injured native birds? Great! The regional economy will measurably benefit! Lots of people are doing this around the world? The Wildlife Population count is going up as a result? Great, the global economy is improving!   But essentially with capitalism: You literally have to take something from somewhere else. And once you have infrastructure and relationships in place to exploit natural resources or whatever else, people running most huge corporations are very reluctant to change their business models away from something that they mostly were able to pull out of the ground for free / got encouragement from bank investments and government funding/subsidies to continue doing.  Now we add the fact that those with the most actually can and do have a big hand in writing the rules and defining much of how markets behave plus are the closest bedfellows to the big banks (lobbying and monopolies that shut out solar from getting fair starts in various states of the US, or a ban on EV vehicles to protect the petroleum industry in the Midwest US) and it's very challenging to change the economy overnight or even in a few years in a country like the US (EU might be a bit easier but it's probably more of a international political game with lots of business maneuvering and interests still, look at the coal mine protest situation in Germany for example). Plus a lot of not all of these major corporations are multinational, they're global influencers.  ......  On a more abstract level, the thought process of maximizing wealth exploitation is arguably baked into the way our currencies operate (and maybe even the way most people think in terms of how the English language works but that's another conversation).  The Fiat system for cash in the US Federal Reserve is basically designed to be extractive too, to get cash it's sort of an extended Ponzi scheme until the buck stops at the Federal Reserve who says the money is worth something because they based it on interest rates and notions of continuous economic growth (the economy must constantly expand and grow according to most conventional economic doctrine, usually from people who think GDP is a great measure for progress even though it's not).   There's a difference between growth that develops healthily within the limits of a cycle and maybe geography/specific area vs. cancerous growth. The continuous growth doctrine is the cancer that makes irreparable polluting and dangerous labor practices and other "externalities" permissable and why most corporations must continue to provide "maximum value for shareholders" by law.  The cash system in the US could be changed using local currencies (it's legal to mint a local currency, you basically need to start your own credit union and get people willing to use the currency in place of/or in tandem with the federal dollar -- Ithica, NY has the Ithica Hour, and there's a place in Massachusetts I'm forgetting that does this too, I think Ann Arbor MI also.) but instead of making $1 of the local currency equal to just $1 of the US Federal Dollar, you could also "score" or Index the value of your local dollar to something else.  Think of Bitcoin, there they base the value on something like the number of people using it, plus every time someone with a computer doing crypto mining solves their magical math problems, the miner gets paid too.  So do this with something that actually matters like the water quality and optimal population size of trees in your region or some other environmental scores.

Israel couldn't occupy south Lebanon, let alone the entire country. They changed their politics towards the Taliban and now the Taliban government is about to become part of the UN.   If Israel was smart, they'd offer back the annexed Shebaa  and Ghajar lands back to Lebanon and Hezbollah would have no reason to exist anymore since that's what they keep asking for (the return of all Lebanese land).   This would allow Lebanese opposition politicians against Hezbollah to start speaking about disarmament and withdrawal from the border since it has no reason to exist anymore.

This feels like a misunderstanding.   No one believes that a 13 year old is fit to raise a child. No one expects a 13 year old to raise a child alone. No one thinks that a 13 year old should have a child. Decades of campaigns to reduce teen pregnancy are pretty clear evidence of that.   If a 13 year old shows up in hospital in labour, she'll be swarmed with social workers until her child is middle-aged. But the right to family is one of the most fundimental human rights. Both cultural intuition and research seems to support the view that if mother and child can be kept together, that's almost always the best choice for both.   >So why is voting something that is absolutely banned for under 18s, whereas the literal creation and maintenance of new life starts with the benefit of the doubt?  16 year olds having children is a regrettable side-effect of their right to have irresponsible sex.

His alternative is some form of self-destruction or nihilism, including altruism and hedonism. He shouldnt sacrifice himself for others, but he also shouldnt sacrifice others to himself. There is no moral justification for to ask someone to exist and suffer so that others dont suffer.   Underlying whats objectively moral for man is that many people face the choice of pursuing and achieving a life worth living and death, so man chooses to pursue a life worth living. But some people dont. Some people face the choice of immense suffering until they die and a quick death, like in a concentration camp or if youre suffering a rare disease.

That's typically why integrated farming practices are preferred in the agronomic literature. Rodale Institute (one of the founders of the regenerative organic cert), which is close by me, grazes their cattle in a long (2-year) rotation paired with a polyculture of nitrogen-fixing, perennial forage crops, fodder cereals, and native grasses. The rest of the rotation is crops, including a cereal grain cash crop. It's better than just letting your fields fallow. You get a lot more microbial biomass and soil organic matter while segregating pathogenic organisms from crops being grown for human consumption. The pathogens are succeeded by beneficial soil microbes by the time you start growing crops on that land again. Any manure and urine recovered from stables is hot composted and redistributed onto fields as needed.  edit: minor clarifications.

It's my personal go-to rebuttal to the myths about the importance of voters/voting.  When I say voters are the "points on the board", I mean that in as *dehumanizing* a sense as that could possibly be taken. You're not an *active participant* in what's going on, you're an *object*. And indeed, as you rightly point out, not even a particularly valuable object, because this is the highest-scoring sport in the history of sports. A single point means a lot in soccer or hockey, where point totals are usually in the single digits. Less so in basketball, where totals not uncommonly break 100. But this is a game where the points are tallied on the order of *millions* and even a "very close" game is decided by a margin of many thousands. Any single *individual* point scored in such a game is indeed totally meaningless.

Same with the increased cost of shipping.  There seems to be a mistaken idea, particularly among conservatives with no actual education in economics, that inflation is just a direct result of money being printed. This is not the case. Inflation is when the prices of goods rise for any reason. Increases to the supply of money do tend to be inflationary, but it is far from the only force at play.  Monopolies cause inflation. So do anti-competetive practices, where competitors collude to raise prices rather than compete on price.  Low interest rates cause inflation. This isn't the same as printing more money, but it has the effect of freeing up more money to be spent.  The expectation of inflation causes inflation. Businesses will raise prices when they think the market will bear it, and lots of talk about inflation tends to make executives think that they won't be the only ones padding their margins.  Inflation since covid has been a global phenomenon. Blaming the government of the country that has among the lowest levels of inflation seems flawed, right?

Read Simon Michaux research papers on (a PhD. expert in mineral processing, Geometallurgy, and energy resources) the realities of the geological requirements for an EV transition.   Oil & gas create fertilizers for food (Haeber Bosch Process), without which we could not have the crop yields (already declining bc of Climate change) needed to feed the 8 billion people on the planet.

Climate, of course, is already killing people, but look at examples of Sri Lanka, Lebanon, and Haiti of collapsing economies and how the lack of oil and fertilizers is affecting everyone.

When Hamas spun out of Mujama and declared themselves the militant wing of Palestinian liberation, Israel cut ties.  It's a pervasive myth because there's an article where an ex-Israeli intelligence official takes responsibility for "creating Hamas." But he's talking about creating them through their activities with Mujama, by allowing the Qatari funds to reach them and by agreeing to negotiate with Mujama.

What's worrying today is that that threat doesn't exist, but is still being projected against moderate, milquetoast centrists of all people by the far right, which is either being ignored or being treated as normal polical discourse.  That is true, but perception is the key word here. In most countries, this perceived threat included social democracy, unions, ..., and the moderate right went along with it all the same. There is no far left to destroy any more, do they take aim at social democracy and its institutions. The threat is manufactured to justify the desired actions, not the other way round.  > What's worrying today is that that threat doesn't exist, but is still being projected against moderate, milquetoast centrists of all people by the far right, which is either being ignored or being treated as normal polical discourse.  Indeed. IMHO, this difference is there because the position of the moderate right had, for a time, changed and then reverted to their pre-war position. Society has changed, they have gone backwards.  They more or less accepted things like unions, social security, political participation by the working class, ... They were forced to draw a distinction between these things and the threat of the radical left (i.e. communism) because if they didn't, they would lose most of their voters, who might disagree on which people should get those rights but do, in fact, want them for themselves. But in the 80'ies the post-war consensus shattered. They no longer accept social democracy, but the institutions created by the latter are now embedded in society. Hence the disconnect between their rhetoric and what a rational person would see: they want to remove institutions that are now part of everyday life, and to do so they have to pretend that they are exponents of the far left. The logical conclusion is that every milquetoast centrist who defends them must be far left. It's a classic example of bad faith.  > Nothing is driven by rationality or even self interest, but rather a huge rump of stupidity and ignorance. There is no honestly in reporting, far right plans and positions are casually brushed off whilst the people pushing them are presented as a moderate, normal politicians by the media, allowing the ignorant to vote for them without agreeing with their positions outside of a few popular curated arguments. I think it's really dangerous.  Indeed, but this broadly mirrors the mood in the 30'ies. Those far right movements were seen as lunatics back then too, even by the moderate right and its leaders. In many cases the political / military leadership despised them because of the populist aspects they incorporated into their ideology. They saw them as a useful distraction of the "ignorant" working classes. They still supported them, mostly because they promised to destroy the left. In practice, this wasn't just the communists but also the unions and the social democrats. Those promises were kept too, and that formed the basis of the reactionary coalition that took over.  The similarities with today are striking. Today's oligarchs (from media moghuls to tech CEO's) also tend to hold reactionary views. They, the racists, the misogynists, the neo-fascists, the religious fundamentalists, ..., are in the same camp because, however much they disagree about everything else and however disparate their material interests, they all believe in a moral and social hierarchy where they are placed above everyone they dislike. What unites them is a hatred of equality and a sense of their own superiority. And just like then, they offer their followers a pleasing alternative to the actual social hierarchy based on wealth, where your social status depends on your identity and, implicitly, on their capacity to destroy equality and turn what used to be rights into privileges.  To those susceptible to these views, who already internalize the basic reactionary idea of a moral and social hierarchy, this alternative becomes more rather than less appealing as more and more avenues to prosperity and social mobility get shut down by the very people who bankroll these movements. This explains why they don't see the problem with depicting moderate social democrats as communists. It has nothing to do with the actual meaning of either term, and everything to do with the fact that they don't (or no longer) believe in equality. Progress becomes degeneracy when you believe in an unchangeable order, any institution or party promoting equality as an assault on your own rights if you see society as a zero sum game, democracy itself as "rigged" when it empowers others. On the flip side, you don't care that billionaires are setting themselves above you, as long as you can do the same to other people.  It's madness, IMHO, but then it was so before. People don't have to think about or understand the mechanisms involved to still take part in it. It's all about emotion rather than reason.

In the current system, ownership of capital is divorced from labour, and consequently labour is commodified. This reduces labour to a mere input. This is dehumanizing and leads to exploitation. Business owners control labour insofar as we live in the capitalist system where capital wields power distinct from labour.  > Are we really against private property? If not, then why are we using a term that is used purely as a reductionist materialist critique of private property?  In the sense used by advocates of consumerist-corporate-capitalism? Absolutely.

Intentionally or negligently misrepresenting a fact with the intent that another person will rely on it to make an decision that they would not have made had the fact not been misrepresented. Standard definition of fraud.   Note this isn't mere criticism or insult directed at a politician.  It's specifically for statements purporting to be factual regarding the qualifications of office and political stances. Trump can call Biden "Sleepy Joe" all he wants, but he couldn't say "Biden's doctors have diagnosed him with dementia."  >You wouldnt worry that judges, appointed by the entity attempting prosecute this, would act impartially as well?  Again, either the judges obey the rule of law, in which case it's not an issue, or they don't, in which case the argument over whether they can be relied on to act rationally is moot.  >And again were relying on someone to decide what is and isnt a lie in a newspaper.  Juries decide matters like that a dozen times a day.  >And as far as I know its still legal to lie in a newspaper. You can be held civilly responsible for damages caused but thats it.  You're not allowed to commit fraud. If a media company publishes an article (not an opinion piece, but something purported to be factual) specifically to, say, manipulate the stock of a company for their own benefit, that's illegal. [And people have been convicted of it.](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2016-184)  Let's use a "for instance": A prominent newspaper known for legitimate journalism publishes an article right before the election claiming that Joe Biden strangles hookers and dumps them in the Potomac on a regular basis. They include police reports and surveillance footage showing this happening,  they present interviews with individuals who witnessed it and identified Biden, and show the sworn deposition from the staffer who arranges the murders. And all of it was fabricated. Completely made up. They knowingly presented a false statement with the intent to change the results of the election. In your mind, that's OK?  >You dont think legitimate journalism will be stifled by a deceitful administration using this power deceitfully?  No. You'd need to prove knowing or reckless misrepresentation of fact and reliance on that fact before a judge *and* jury. That's a high bar and any legitimate journalistic activity would fall far short.

If I were to outline a set of features needed for an *optimized* platform for doing philosophy, Reddit would not be it.  But if I may bind you to a stronger form of your position: I believe I can make an appeal that Reddit is not formally incompatible or fatally unusable for philosophical discussion.  In order to be formally incompatible with with doing philosophy, I argue that a platform would need to be said to interfere with the ability of two (or more) parties to have such a discussion, to such an extent that they will abandon it *in spite of a greater desire to continue it.*  Defects that I would qualify as so-interfering: 1. Actively impeding the exchange of ideas, once it has commenced, such as by: 1a. censorship 1b. denial of platform access 1c. hecklers veto. Or relatedly in the case of face-to-face: being too damn loud, or kicking the participants out because its last call.  2. Creating conditions that impede the ability to start such a discussion in the first place. For instance by having: 2a. no mechanism to advance a proposition 2b. no mechanism to reply to one 2c. no mechanism to reply to that reply, etc.  3. Introduce competing stimuli/effects that render the participants unwilling to continue. Either by: 3a. Concern that there will be spillover consequences from the discussion that are undesirable (the stick) 3b. Inducing the participants to alternate activities too appealing to be willing to continue (the carrot)  On factor 1: I would give American social media generally and Reddit specifically high marks. True, you can get the banhammer or the shadow ban. But the majority of serious and conscientious philosophical discussions wont.  On factor 2: I concur with other commenters who note that the asynchronous and text-based format is in fact truly a boon. I can imagine (and almost included) an impediment to the utility of a text-based platform - say, the threads are all out of order or hard to pull up to reference. But F2F has this by default. Reddit wins over voice almost by default by being in print; it is perhaps not optimally searchable (either by tools or just by perusal) to the same degree as other text-based platforms (books, emails), but it is serviceable. The drafting is a bit sketchy if you need to change windows, on my phone.  On factor 3: we are getting into some taller grass. 3a. There are many moral-philosophy discussions I probably wouldnt have, and definitely wouldnt have freely, on the internet.  But for that matter: neither would I at work, or with a family member, or perhaps where audible to the public. I probably dont have the stones to publish at all with, say, Peter Singers argument.  However, this is a narrow (if enticing) subset of all the philosophical discussions that might be had, and most of them do not at all have this same issue.  3b. Cest linternet. You are always just a few keystrokes from literally everything. This will surely weed out the brief-minded and impatient from holding on to a complex discussion long enough to make progress.  But again concurring with other commenters: those people arent prime candidates for a philosophical discussion in the first place. I believe we must grant that suitably-persistent people can indeed be found on the internet, or enticed to it if the offer is good enough, such that our discussions are not sure to die for lack of counterparties.  To again concur with other commenters: the who is the main thing. The where and how are almost always going to be manageable if you find the right sparring partner.  Is Reddit an *optimal* pool of participants for a philosophical partners? Gods, no. Any more than tinder is an optimal way to meet your wife: it selects for people who want to be part of ephemeral popularity.  And even if it is not exclusive of people whose interests run counter to that: its open-mic format is such that the short-attentioned (or worse: willful malefactors) can pop in the door of our seminar or symposium, toss in their unuseful two cents, and potentially derail things.   Taken together: Reddit is not at all a finely-tuned pool from which to draw participants. In the way of, say, a group of fellow philo majors on the quad or in the dining hall at a university.   What it is, is an unfathomably large pool. Such that you can literally just throw a conversation-starter out, and utter strangers will bite. Do not try this on the subway, friends - indeed, is there anywhere at all where initiating up a philosophical discussion *without a counterparty planned in advance* is going to be even remotely as tenable?  True: you may get more chaff than wheat with such shots in the dark. But its an anonymous shot in the dark: the hell else would you expect?  This leaves only the question: does Reddit make it too damn hard to winnow down to the key participant(s) you want to extend the interaction with? And compared to what? I shall leave that as an exercise for the reader.

Mosul also has a lower population density. Israeli intelligence currently suggests 5-6k Hamas fighters killed which if we subtract them from the current estimate of deaths that is 13k we end up with 7-8k civilian deaths so roughly equivalent to Mosul low end estimates.   2nd battle of Fallujah is also an interesting comparison because 70-90% of the population had left before it started. Even still the low end has 600 civilian deaths for 1200 insurgent deaths and the high end has 800 civilian deaths for 2000 insurgent deaths. That is in basically the best case scenario for conducting an urban assault in terms of minimizing civilian casualties.  I think the problem here is most of the public does not understand the reality of urban warfare. They think there is a magical way to conduct urban operations avoiding all civilian casualties and only killing bad guys.
2020-12-11 07:07:36, 0.012463537523203394, reddit_opinion_climate_change.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: So just how much is 100 billion tons of carbon (or 100 Petagrams of carbon [PgC]) in terms of CO?  _________________  The atomic mass for carbon (C) is 12 grams per mole.  The atomic mass of oxygen (O) is 16 grams per mole.  CO is therefore C+(2O)= 44 grams per mole (12+(216)).  The ratio of carbon in this overall molar mass is equal to 12/44 = 0.27  The ratio of molar mass is also equal to the ratio of mass in grams. Therefore, there are 0.27 g of C for every gram of CO.  To convert from C to CO we simply divide the total amount of C by the ratio... in this case 100 PgC / 0.27 results in 370 PgCO or 370 GtCO (to go from CO to C the ratio is 44/12 or 3.67).   The conversion tables of the [Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/pns/convert.html#3.) show that 1 part per million (ppm) of atmospheric CO is equivalent to 2.13 Gigatonnes Carbon (GtC). Using our ratios from above then, 1ppm atmospheric CO = 7.81 GtCO. So 370 GtCO is therefore equal to 47.4 ppm. Now we know that 100 PgC is the same as increasing atmospheric CO by 47.4 ppm. The global growth rate of atmospheric CO since 2017 has been around 2.5  0.1 ppm yr^-1 . 47.4 ppm by 2100, represents a rather large fraction then, averaging an additional 0.6 C yr^-1

In addition, I think cooperatives are superior to unionized firms for a number of reasons. For one, high taxes can disincentivize investment. Cooperatives, on the other hand, are *predistributionary* meaning they achieve similar effects as high taxes and heavy redistribution without deadweight loss. Cooperatives naturally pay their employees well and adopt compressed pay scales - ie they pay a living wage and dont have as high pay discrepancies between management and the average employee.  Cooperatives also provide employment stability that really isnt rivalled by any other alternative, which I think is a benefit since most people want employment stability even if that means lower pay during the hard times.  As for existing firms, I think a law allowing workers to buy out failed firms and having punitively high taxes on conventional firms, as well as a law banning starting new businesses as joint stock firms could all be fairly popular and go a long way to establishing a mutual economy.

An easy double standard achieved.  Secondly, the number reported by the Gaza health ministry has been historically accurate with a 10-12% discrepancy while also being cognizant of blind-spots and weaknesses. Pretty good considering the circumstances wouldnt you say?  And I mean thirdly, the onus is on Israel to explain who these people are when massacring them. So the question becomes is the IDF inept?

Im not saying France was wrong but just surprised from a medical perspective.  Some hostages like Omer Wenkert who suffered from GI diseases maybe could just start his medications again (my specialty wasnt GI).  I know heart failure though. There is no safe way to restart heart failure medication without taking into account weight loss, water intake and other crucial electrolytes for cardiac function such as potassium, magnesium, calcium and sodium.   The diuretics, digoxin, anti arrhythmics and any type of beta blockers would be unsafe to restart without physician supervision. As well as insulin and supplements like thyroid.  Did France just bring in a bunch of antibiotics and GI meds? Because other then that along with skin antibiotics/ anti fungal creams, I dont understand what medications France can send in to start without medical supervision.  Im curious from a medical perspective. But mostly sad because France could have used the pressure otherwise. Such as let the Red Cross see the hostages which is much more directly needed.

In Canada and USA certain tree species benefit from wildfires, but this isn't the case in the Amazon. And there's no records of wildfires in the Amazon prior to the mid-1990s.  In the Amazon rainfall washes away soil nutrients in areas that aren't protected by the forest's canopy and root system, which is why the farmers there are continually making way for new farmland: Land cleared only a few years before is no longer arable. It's also worth mentioning that there is evidence that pre-Columbian people manually planted and cultivated a great deal of the Amazonian rainforest, so that kind of action would likely be required to reverse wildfire damage.

The land does not belong to the people who are trying to kill you. You forfeit your land if you try to exterminate your neighbor.  I mean, Israel can just look at all the other Arab countries, right? Every single Muslim country is an apartheid country, but much worse than apartheid-era SA.  Even in South Africa, during apartheid, there were still blacks and whites and South Asians. They were segregated by neighborhood, yes, but still alive, and in the country. People "of color" (different legal designations) were oppressed, but their populations actually increased from year to year. Apartheid, yes; genocide no.  In most modern Muslim countries, the Christians, Jews, Hindus and others are tiny minorities, because the rest have been expelled or their ancestors forcibly converted. How many Jews are left in Egypt? How many Armenians in Turkey? How many Assyrians and Yezidis in Iraq? Or they have been completely cleansed out by the Muslim majority.  Shall we mention the outright actual genocides? Armenians, Greeks, Yezidis, etc.  Algeria, for example, is a terrible, worse-than-apartheid state. Almost zero non-Muslims.  Statistically, Israel is the least "apartheid" country in all the Middle East, North Africa, Near East, etc.  Indeed, Israeli Arabs have more economic opportunities and freedoms than the Arabs in any Arab country. Yes, you can live a good life as an Arab citizen of UAE. But the deal is that you have no political freedom, unless you are connected to the ruling class.

Likewise, Israel should respect the Palestinian's state borders, obviously halt **any** settlement expansion, propose and implement a plan in a reasonable timeline to dismantle settlements whose citizens choose to remain under Israeli land, and cooperate with Palestine so that Israelis that remain in Palestinian territories are recognized full citizenship rights the same way other minorities (like Palestinians that hold Israeli citizenship) are in Israel.   So to summarize, I think we are on the same boat here, as I so feel most people truthfully are, and the extremist are vocal minorities (or that is my hope).   We do seem to disagree however regarding the legitimacy of Israel's military campaign. I must clarify, as always, I am distraught at what is happening.

The definition of Palestine or From the river to the sea is from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, Palestine will be free.   This is a coverup for the calling of the genocide of the Jewish people. The Six-Day War of 1967 wasnt calling for a two-state solution, it was calling for the execution of every living Israeli.   I understand your sympathy for Palestine, but I cant sympathize with the things Ive seen and the atrocities that theyve committed. Its horrific and extremely disturbing. I dont understand how someone can look at it and not be disgusted, let alone do it with their own two hands.   Ive seen videos of graduation ceremonies for Palestinian children at the ages of 5 and up for passing warfare training. And the way you know without even having to dig that deep (trust me I did anyway I hate being lied to) is from watching them take a photo of a group of Palestinian children holding assault rifles in their hands while looking at the camera.   This is disturbing and i honestly do pray that those children find the right path and live wonderful lives of peace. But from what Ive seen, heard, and gotten proof of, I simply cant find it in me to find an ounce of sympathy for them right now.   I saw a video about a month back of an Israel hostage being hit with sticks over and over again by some other children who were Palestinian citizens of the Gaza Strip. They were hitting him with these sticks and saying to him look at the little Jew boy cry for us Jew boy wheres your mother Jew boy? That really made my stomach turn.   And I know that the children just didnt decide to do this for no reason. Theyve been influenced by the people around them. Its not the childrens fault, its the parents and the civilization that theyre surrounded by.   The only way we can stride for peace is by putting a stamp on anyone who tries to disturb it.   There was no reason for the attack on October 7th. I see no justification whatsoever. But unfortunately, someone eventually has to pay the price.

"Organic" doesnt mean anything.  There simply is no magic that can undo or erase their physiology im truly sorry to tell you. Cows are ruminants that ferment, poop and fart a lot, ok buddy?  2)   You cant have beef production on "existing pasture" as demand for meat is growing due to both population growth and economic development outside developed countries. This is obvious as is but it clearly needs to be pointed out.  And with meat production (esp Bovid meat), we cannot feed the world because there is not enough land, whatever form of beef production is used. With current trends we would need 4 earths or more to feed the world using current diets. Plus, raising cattle just worsens climate change due to its massive emissions, which will accelerate the collapse in food production, and pollutes water resources.  Yet, because directly eating plants directly represents a jump of only one trophic level, instead of two like beef (see ecological efficiency ten percent law link), the respource use efficiency is off the charts higher compared to beef. This automatically leads to less land use change, less pesticides (as well as no farts, poop, or the damage those cause), since much less plants need to be grown, on a smaller area, than when those plants are fed to cattle raised for humans.  because of this higher efficiency of resource (land, water, nutrients, etc,) use, replacing beef production with protein rich plant production would reduce the necessary amount of agricultural land drastically, generally estimated at ~75%. This land could then be reforested and turned into carbon sinks, and habitats for wildlife.  For anything else, i really cant help you, it really is just basic biology and basic thermodynamics. I suggest you inform yourself and let yourself process this over time, you are clearly experiencing heaps of cognitive dissonance right now, and thats your responsibility to deal with, not mine.

Because it forced Republicans in blue and purple districts to be put on the record whether they support or are against that stuff, and paints Republicans as unwilling to actually govern.

The only time this happens is when gas is used to transition away from coal while renewables are used to increase capacity, as what happened here in the U.K. (and massively reduced our energy generation emissions) and now we are phasing out coal too.

This raises the possibility that CH4 produced deep within the soil column can vent to the atmosphere via tree roots even when the water table (WT) is below the surface. If correct, this would challenge modelling efforts where inundation often defines the spatial extent of ecosystem CH4 production and emission. Here, we examine CH4 exchange on tree, soil and aquatic surfaces in forest experiencing a dynamic WT at three floodplain locations spanning the Amazon basin at four hydrologically distinct times from April 2017 to January 2018. Tree stem emissions were orders of magnitude larger than from soil or aquatic surface emissions and exhibited a strong relationship to WT depth below the surface (less than 0). We estimate that Amazon riparian floodplain margins with a WT<0 contribute 2.23.6TgCH4yr1 to the atmosphere in addition to inundated tree emissions of approximately 12.721.1TgCH4yr1. Applying our approach to all tropical wetland broad-leaf trees yields an estimated non-flooded floodplain tree flux of 6.4TgCH4yr1 which, at 17% of the flooded tropical tree flux of approximately 37.1TgCH4yr1, demonstrates the importance of these ecosystems in extending the effective CH4 emitting area beyond flooded lands.

Of course we don't *want* to nationalize it.  The CEOs should figure out how to manage their work force in a competitive way.    We have a public socialized military, public interstate highways, public police.    Privatizing the highways is fun one if your are ever talking libertarian values.  There would be a lot more rail options if the interstate was privatized.  Sanders is obviously not libertarian.  So lets stick with supporting unions and mild regulation of structural monopolies.    Sanders has proposed free internet, public owned electricity, and single payer health care.    On German rails (Deutsche Bahn, a state owned enterprise) you can actually get around by mass transit.

The long term evidence we have says that the climate on earth can change without human influence. Yes. This however doesnt mean that we cant influence the climate, and it also doesnt mean its unreasonable to assume that we can, especially not if you consider the way we as a species have developed in the past 250 years and how our industrial capacity and output, and therefore the scale of us interacting with the environment and atmosphere has changed.   >To say that human influence is contributing to something that would be happening anyways would be a more reasonable way to get human beings to agree with your logic and reasoning.  Thats the thing though, the climate would change anyway, it wouldnt change in the way we are seeing now though. Thats exactly what scientists are saying. The increase in global mean temperatures cant be explained without taking human actions into account. No one is saying the climate cant change without human influence.

What epistemological view are you trying to advance in which "The Civil War being about slavery is just, like, your opinion, man" seems like the best example to hang your hat on? It's not strict empiricism, because you can't actually observe the 8 million people either. Is it skepticism, saying you can't observe internal states, so internal states are unknowable, so nothing ever has a knowable motivation? I don't get it.  But even if you were a skeptical strict empiricist who thought motivations were unknowable and therefore talking about motivations is a matter of fuzzy opinions, that wouldn't come into play here. Points programs are very real, sitting right in front of us, where we can readily observe them. Are you saying we can't observe regressiveness?

Bush had been a firm *believer* in the idea that bringing democracy to countries was how to make them cool with the west. But ultimately, he must have not gotten the memo that this has never been us policy. The US has been involved in installing dictators that were more friendly to the west in quite a few places: Reza Shah in iran, Suharto in Indonesia, Boris yeltzin, Pinochet in Chile, Batista in Cuba, the dirty war in Argentina, and the list goes on. and there have been attempts to eliminate anti-western dictators like saddam Hussein, Qaddafi, and Assad and replace them. Mostly just destabilized the regions and left a power vacuum in those cases. We saw protests against these sorts of dictators in the Arab spring, but there were also protests against other dictators. A lot of it was a reaction to these governments being too pro-western, but it was different in assads case because he is an alawite and the Sunnis didnt like him or his constituency which was a big tent. But a de facto nepotistic dictatorship nonetheless.   Bush just didnt understand this, i think, just really optimistic, which is a good view I personally believe, because I dont think that installing dictators that are cool with the US but particularly brutal to their people results in something better. Especially within the sectarian  religious world in the Middle East.  You look at the situation right now with hamas, and you know Israel is going to get rid of them completely, and Israel is not going to let Palestinians have elections. Period. No way they would. Too much fear of some new hamas getting elected. Same thing happening there. Fatah will get control of the West Bank and Gaza. There will not be elections.

What this report is saying that there are about 100 large oil, gas and coal companies that extract 71% of the resources to sell on. They don't cause the emissions themselves. Shell doesn't BURN the oil they extract, they SELL it to consumers and industry.  So even though 71% can be "traced back" to 100 companies, 90% of those emissions, or 64% total emissions were actually caused by consumers down the line. That means, electricity companies that make our power, heavy industry that makes our products, airlines that fly us across the world and people themselves that ride their cars.   That's what this report says. Ultimately, society at large is to blame. Not those 100 companies.   Again, let me reiterate. Many of those companies lied about the impact of their products on global climate change. So they are responsible in other ways. But in the end, they were not the ones that emitted the CO2. We did.

Using 300years of ocean mixed-layer temperature records preserved in sclerosponge carbonate skeletons, we demonstrate that industrial-era warming began in the mid-1860s, more than 80years earlier than instrumental sea surface temperature records. The Sr/Ca palaeothermometer was calibrated against modern (post-1963) highly correlated (R2=0.91) instrumental records of global sea surface temperatures, with the pre-industrial defined by nearly constant (<0.1C) temperatures from 1700 to the early 1860s. Increasing ocean and land-air temperatures overlap until the late twentieth century, when the land began warming at nearly twice the rate of the surface oceans. Hotter land temperatures, together with the earlier onset of industrial-era warming, indicate that global warming was already 1.70.1C above pre-industrial levels by 2020. Our result is 0.5C higher than IPCC estimates, with 2C global warming projected by the late 2020s, nearly two decades earlier than expected."

It's a tough position because Israel has basically trapped Gazans in a cage where and impacted their access to economic benefit *and* proper medicine for a long time.   So if they just open their borders to Gaza, they put themselves at risk. I definitely don't want that. I think a good first step is withdrawal from all forcibly occupied territories. That includes the West Bank. The West Bank is not part of Israel so they shouldn't have grounds to occupy and restrict movement. I would support them defending *their own border*.  Then we can show the Palestinians genuine social and financial support,  show them that Hamas isn't the only one willing to fight for them.   Once they start growing again, we make continued support conditional on them rebuking Hamas and cooperating with their capture. We try to infiltrate Hamas, gather intel, and try to destroy them.   The US did that with Al-Qaeda. I'm sure Al-Qaeda exists, but it isn't as strong as it was.   This is all armchair speculation. I don't actually know what the answer is. I just know what it can't be. I refuse to execute 15 innocent men to get to 1 guilty one.   This continued aggression isn't going to destroy Hamas. It's going to radicalize Palestinians into the arms of Hamas.

Skilled labour is about 66% of the total cost of a nuclear power station, so they will make a huge saving there. Cheap loans from the government will also help - this is a bigger than expected issue as the loans can take decades to pay back.   Due to the huge labour pool and good manufacturing base they already have, they can also cut down the construction time to around 5-7 years. I think they have already worked out the design they want to use so they won't have to spend on prototyping.

The young needs to do the same for climate change and I'll join ya.  Protest big oil, use accurate information to lean on politicians for change. Some are taking big oil to court (and winning) for suppressing and ignoring the warning of the scientists of their day.  Right now is a good time as green energy such as solar wind oceanic and geothermal is both cheap and clean and can be implemented quickly.  Politicians do what the people say if it hit's their bottom line and their chances of re election.  Do not destroy or interrupt those that aren't part of the protest, doing so negates the efforts, When we protested for green peace they would have meeting before hand and tell us what to do and what not to do.  We wanted the press to show up but we didn't want them to televise disruptions to business and people not involved in what we were protesting and it's much easer to rally people today than it was then.

CCS can directly reduce industrial CO2 emissions and is essential for the retention of CO2 extracted from the atmosphere. To be effective as a climate change mitigation tool, CO2 must be securely retained for 10,000 years (10 ka) with a leakage rate of below 0.01% per year of the total amount of CO2 injected. Migration of CO2 back to the atmosphere via leakage through geological faults is a potential high impact risk to CO2 storage integrity. Here, we calculate for the first time natural leakage rates from a 420 ka paleo-record of CO2 leakage above a naturally occurring, faulted, CO2 reservoir in Arizona, USA. Surface travertine (CaCO3) deposits provide evidence of vertical CO2 leakage linked to known faults. U-Th dating of travertine deposits shows leakage varies along a single fault and that individual seeps have lifespans of up to 200 ka. Whilst the total volumes of CO2 required to form the travertine deposits are high, time-averaged leakage equates to a linear rate of less than 0.01%/yr. Hence, even this natural geological storage site, which would be deemed to be of too high risk to be selected for engineered geologic storage, is adequate to store CO2 for climate mitigation purposes.
2024-05-20 15:29:33, 0.012457317160016542, reddit_opinion_PSE_ISR.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: The ICC took a number of questionable positions in this analysis.  First, the ICC is recognizing Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem as an independent state from Israel.  Israel is not a signatory to the ICC but "Palestine" is and that is their ***sole*** source of jurisdiction over this entire dispute.  Regardless of whether you think it ***should*** be a state, those areas have ***never*** been a state.  Second, using the ICC's own characterization of "Palestine" as an independent but occupied warring state, the ICC is treading entirely new ground in the level of responsibility Israel has for Gaza.  It appears that vast majority of the ICC's analysis is based, not on Israel's bombing campaign, but on Israel exercising control over its own borders with Gaza.  Interestingly, Egypt placed similar if not more restrictions on aid flowing from Egypt to Gaza, but Egypt is conspicuously absent from the ICC's analysis.  Why?  Because the ICC has invented obligations that Israel has for Gaza out of whole cloth and those newly invented obligations do not apply to Egypt.  Egypt isn't a signatory to the ICC, but neither is Israel.  The ICC states that they have jurisdiction based on the crime being committed in Gaza so if it's a crime for Israel it's a crime for Egypt.  But it's not--because the ICC characterizes the crime as one Israel can commit but Egypt can't.  Also conspicuously absent is Iran, who has shipped weapons to Gaza with the full knowledge that those weapons would be used against Israeli civilians.  Not important to the ICC though.  Under the ICC's analysis, Israel bears criminal responsibility for obligations that do not exist for any other state in the world and that have never been applied to any other state in the world in the history of the ICC.  These new obligations create war crimes that do not even require intent because they're "proven" based on the obligations the ICC has now placed on Israel.  Under the ICC's argument, Israel is ***obligated under threat of criminal penalties*** to provide power, water, food, and medical supplies to Gaza through Israel's territory even while Israel is at war with Gaza.  Any interruption to this flow during literal wartime is a war crime but only for Israel.  Again, despite Egypt doing ***exactly the same thing***, Egypt is absent because Egypt doesn't have any obligations to the people of Gaza.  Israel is going to show 50 years of the ICC ignoring egregiously worse conduct only to pop up with invented jurisdiction and invented crimes to seek the arrest of Israeli leaders.  I'll just list a few countries that are expressly within the jurisdiction of the ICC, but where the ICC has not sought arrests:  Afghanistan.  Yup.  The "investigation" has been open for about 10 years, but Khan himself doesn't think it's serious enough to request any arrests.  Democratic Republic of Congo.   Considered the deadliest conflict since WWII, but Khan believes it's nothing compared to, checks notes, temporarily limiting aid trucks to Gaza.  Nigeria.  "Boko Haram" who?  I mean, you could do 30 of these in currently ongoing conflicts, but they involve people who aren't Israel and so the UN and the ICC aren't interested in these at all.
2023-12-18 04:53:57, 0.012457317160016542, reddit_opinion_PSE_ISR.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: Heads up, my answer is going to be just my opinion and I'll wax philosophical a bit. Infosec and cyber security wasn't my field. But like anyone, I do love to debate these types of topics with anyone so I'll probably type a lot too. (and as American citizens, we SHOULD want to talk to each other about this stuff as it keeps us engaged in our politics - ie, those that we elect and put in charge of studying and monitoring these conundrums professionally, right?)  Right up front let me just say two VERY important things for anyone to understand:   One: your government agencies - including the CIA, NSA, military, and law enforcement agencies - are made up of your fellow Americans. Just everyday people like you, me, and everyone you know. Yes, most typically tend to be more educated due to college and high performance requirements, strict no-nonsense demands in regards to your character and security background assessment, and so forth - but still people that just wanna do a good job and then go home to their families just like anyone else (and then talk shit on Reddit about every topic under the sun). Sorry, but no shadowy agencies within agencies type stuff going on... Well, okay some are a little secretive due to security concerns so they SEEM mysterious - but once you gain access and the mystery is gone, it's just like any other job. Bureaucratic and lots of oversight and lots and lots of dull paperwork.  And two: Your fear, and other fears like your subject - that is why I'm such a true believer in a democratic government, demanding any leadership to have strong character and ethics (and I mean ALL leadership from the President all the way down to your local cop), and why it's so important that we take our civic responsibilities seriously as individual Americans. Whether it's nuclear technology, devastating weapons of war, tools of oppression like you're concerned about, biological warfare , etc - a democracy means we collectively get to decide who holds the keys to systems that could end all human life on this planet, enslave it, etc.  Seriously. No, I mean it - seriously. Your questions hit on a REAL serious topic people should consider with the utmost respect, just as they would about threats of nuclear winter or another world war.  So that out of the way... Yes, I feel it should be of *concern* to the average person. But also no one should feel true fear of the unknown, and right now there is no true looming known threat - just an unknown future and frontier. So don't let it give you daily anxiety, really.   That said, I have *more* concern than I ever have. One of our Presidential candidates has proven himself to be a traitor to the people and the country, stolen and possibly sold our most important world-altering security secrets to (yet) unknown entities, and has openly said he will destroy our checks and balances that are there to limit his office's power as well as putting all enforcement and military agencies under his power through complete dictatorial means on day 1 of his Presidency if elected. We also have a huge problem with the GOP, with so many of them openly admitting they favor that "Project 2025" insanity (btw the major money behind that? Koch, as well as religious fundamentalists - it should be taken very seriously as a threat to our country imo). And it saddens and alarms me to no end that so many people back these plans.  If elected, both of our sets of fears may very well come true if this country falls to become a dictatorship in any form.  So I circle back to my second point and that our democracy, especially American democracy, is so incredibly important. We are THE most powerful military force on the planet by several magnitudes ahead of any other country with more collective resources, tech, and well trained and educated personnel than all the rest of the first world nations combined. So for the concern of the whole world as well as ourselves (considering the topic we're discussing impacts everyone), we have a much larger responsibility as citizens to make sure we elect the right people to shape how we enter than that unknown future. Whether it's because we are developing those tools that have such destructive power, or because we may be forced to engage with a country who tries to develop them to threaten us or the world, we need to make sure we do better at being sensible, realistic, and RATIONAL American citizens when we vote.  But also back to point number 1: as long as we keep our checks and balances in place and strengthen them by placing the right people in those seats of power, everyone from the President down to that local cop MUST answer to our society as a whole. A President can order a system to be turned against its people - but there will still be layers and layers of others between him and the proverbial button that have a conscience and a sense of duty *to the people*.  I was a very decorated, very respected officer who was given a LOT of authority and power. And all while I was *barely* an adult of 25. Why? Because I took my oaths to my country and our people very seriously, and when my agency always preached things like "we do the right thing because it's the right thing, always" and "we serve the citizens before anyone or anything else" and "command can give orders, but you are the one who has to make the right call in the final moment" I listened. I executed my duties with not only professionalism and a strong sense of ethics... But I did so also with empathy and understanding for the individual just as if I was dealing with my own neighbor.   So all those layers in my command that act as their own smaller checks and balances recognized "this guy gets it" and fast tracked me and trained me to be the guy that teaches others to do it the same way. They put the public's trust in my hands to continue to uphold our constitutional values and rights.   So, again... As long as we continue to engage in our democracy with the reason and respect it demands, there will always be many, many MooseWhippets at every level who will receive the orders to turn on the people unjustly, and then will respond "Sir, on behalf of the people of these United States I am placing you under arrest for treason." (Or, if our justice system and system of laws has been corrupted, well... As I would say, I'd "Boondocks Saints" the situation).  Idk if that's the answer you're looking for, but it's my honest one.

The average person before this very much did and many do still associate the two together, because they never heard voices saying anything to the contrary for most of their lives.   The others are not making excuses to hate Jews. They are stating an unfortunate and frustrating reality. There truly are a lot of people who associate Israel and Judaism as a monolith who don't have the nuance to not hate Jews for this. Much like a non-zero number of Zionists being hateful towards innocent Palestinian children born after Hamas came into power because they truly do associate them with Hamas, because that is all their propaganda has ever told them.  There is a lot of hate in this conflict, and it's not going to go away easily. Hamas and Bibi alike have made things so much harder globally for innocent people who have no say in this whatsoever, because both are horrendous entities and beings who simply do not care about the harm their actions cause.

It was *amazing* to me how focused the pol was on me since I am a constituent. They explained it was because the rep knew I was likely speaking for 10 people- family, neighbors, friends, coworkers.

As an adult, you can understand or research the importance of both, you have a fully developed brain, and you can make the choice to seek therapy.

I see a lot of people talking about recycling, going vegan, taking the bus etc but with no appreciation for what the numerical targets are. And it's not that hard to understand, I summarised it in my original comment.   My annual carbon footprint is probably about 10 tonnes (from the UK). If I was to get down to 1 tonne, I would guess that I'd have to never buy any new clothes again, never use my heating again, never drive my car again (so can't get to work), go vegan today. It's just not feasible and as a result of that I don't think the world is planning effectively enough for the future by recognising the likely outcome.  The only way we could achieve the goal is by using some carbon capture technology that is radically different, which does not exist yet, or some other crazy idea like a sun-umbrella in space.

I am clearly missing something as 1.5C seems  like a modest number. To me it refers to each hour of the day being 1.5C warmer than it was on average, versus a previous time span.  For example, if summers in New York were 80F on average over the past 100 years, and are now 82.7 F on average, and that took 30-50 years to measure out, does it suggest that in 90- 150 years  the temps will be too hot to sustain  life?

An essentially infinite energy source powering an economy of infinite growth doesnt sound like a good combination. I feel as though at that point we really would just be a machine upon the earth that would consume, extract, and exploit every possible resource on the planet.   If we really want to tackle the climate crisis and solve the problem at its source sadly we have to talk economics (economics is boring and I dont understand it fully  ). Ushering in degrowth forms of economy is pry the single most effective and necessary way to avert further ecological collapse and climate breakdown.   Theres this saying, its easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism, which is often the attitude most people have when talking about the ecological crisis, myself included most of the time. But there are discussions happening and the times are a changing. Like the whole point of our current economic system is infinite growth/consumption on a planet of tipping points and limitsthe whole thing is quite literally unsustainable and at some point when we start crossing into the land of finding out after fucking around for so long it will make zero sense for our prime motive to be making money as a civilization.   I, personally, find that there will be a sort of all hands on deck global effort similar to how the world behaved during WW2. I also do think we are a lot more adaptable and resilient than Reddit minds have you believe with the insufferable infinite scroll of doom. It just sucks that for us to get to that point millions of people and beautiful ecosystems have to die for us to take the problem seriously.

You cant do both unless you have several lifetimes to spare.   If you want to read the science, go to the IPCC, which basically collates all the climate science around the world, so here is a list of the science papers referenced https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/technical-papers/ccw/references.pdf  If you want to start from a position where you hear denier arguments and want to find the evidence and science that debunks the denier rhetoric, try skeptical science which is careful to reference established and peer reviewed science in its debunking  There are also free lectures from stanford on you tube that go through climate change by going through every discipline of science that is relevant  Ultimately if you secretly want to be a hero and magically prove its all a hoax, then you've entered into the field with malicious intentions and will be satisfied with any error bars of doubt, ignoring the fact that science is focussed on that exact doubt and testing it.

"palestine" as a national identity was only invented in the 1960's by arab islamist nationalists from the arab league out of racist pride and fervor FOR THE EXPLICIT PURPOSE of derailing the newly created Jewish nation in the arab world and ethnically cleansing the levant of jewish civilians and war refugees. Including the jewish women and little children who had barely escaped the death camps.  The arabs/palestinians saw boats of starving jewish holocaust refugees from europe, and their blood started boiling. They had deep seated hatred for migrants and for jews. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem had a close relationship with Hitler afterall.  Tens of thousands of these young holocaust survivors were murdered by anti-immigrant arab-supremacist palestinians who wanted to rid the levant of jews. There are Cemetaries in Israel filled with their young innocent mutilated jewish bodies. They never got a chance to live life or escape the torment. The palestinians and Arab League wanted the same fate for all the jews there, and they tried their best to make it happen but failed.  That famous palestinian flag you see everywhere was only adopted by palestine in 1964. Palestine never had its own flag before that, because palestine as a national identity neveer existed. It was known as the territory of judea and samaria until the romans invaded and renamed it the territory of palestina and made it part of syria as history revision. No one in the territory of palestine ever thought of themselves as a nation before the 1960's because they were nothin but a territory of other nations. That flag is no worse than the KKK flag, as it represents arab racial supremacy and the desire to expulel the jew minority "back to europe" instead of "back to africa".  This comes down to a big powerful 1-billion strong religion persecuting one of the smallest minority religions on earth. They have the power, the oil money, and the resources to manipulate the narrative.  They may have the power to revise history and write their own narratives. But we don't have to believe it, and we CERTAINLY are not required to parrot their propaganda.  Enough is enough with this bullsh-t narrative of navi/avatar. Palestinians are descendents of the arab armies that invaded the holy land. They are about as native to Israel as italians are.

The PLO/PA leadership recognized Israel's right to exist and moved toward a two-state solution, but Hamas rose on the back of the idea of resisting compromise and is the more popular party at this point.   You can make the literal same argument for Likud and Netanyahu. Likuds party platform states the prevention of a Palestinian state is their highest priority, and Netanyahu had been leading mock funeral processions for Rabin before his assassination. Yet Israelis  flocked to the polls to elect him in the election after Rabin was killed.    > So it makes more sense to say that the Palestinian people have signaled in all sorts of ways that they don't want to compromise via a 2-state solution and are more interested in holding out until they get what they want.   Again can we not say this same thing about Israelis? What were they signaling when the prime minister who was attempting peaceful coexistence was assassinated? What were they signaling in the elections that followed where they elected parties and politicians to lead the country who most loudly opposed the peace deal and had been calling for the death of the since-assassinated prime minister?   > It's a funny thing: the number of people on Reddit who argue some version of "if they can just get rid of their leaders, they can make peace" is stunningly high. They vastly underestimate the "pull" that millions of average citizens have. Netanyahu was been elected multiple times, after all, and even after everything that's happened, Hamas is more popular than ever. Let's just be honest: Hamas is the party the Palestinians prefer, because they consider the PA corrupt, soft and compromised.   By this logic, can we stop saying Israelis just want peaceful coexistence and to be left alone. After all, Netanyahu has won far more elections than Hamas, and preventing a Palestinian state is their top political priority per their charter.   > The idea of Hamas being "removed" and replaced with some group the West prefers is the whole reason they love Hamas. They want what THEY want, in other words, not what WE want for them. I guess we can somehow force a 2-state solution on the parties, but it certainly won't bring peace. Missiles will just arrive in Israel from a new Palestinian state, Israel will bomb the new state, rinse and repeat. Plus -- whatever party runs a new Palestinian state, they won't last more than two years until Hamas overthrows them, and then we've got Hamas in charge of a full-blown state.  People who have lived for decades as a stateless, rightless people under a military occupation and blockade by the same people who deny them a state want someone who they feel will fight for them. Who could have guessed.   The PLO and P.A. recognized Israels right to exist 30 years ago, howd that work out for them? Did Israel give them any extra autonomy, reduce the occupation, anything? No, they just continued to restrict Palestinians ability to build on or move to 63% of the West Bank.  Palestinians still need permits from Israel to travel within the West Bank. The settlements have continued expanding and the settler population has exploded.   If that is how Israel is going to respond to Palestinians attempting peaceful coexistence, are you surprised some dont think its going to work?

About a week later the person posted that they didn't know anyone remembered them, and it made them talk to their irl friends, who were also worried but didn't know how bad it was, and long story short, they moved back in with their parents and started going to therapy.

Perhaps this is a US Vs U.K. mentality, as even our older and right wing generally are more climate aware.

Honestly a doomer mindset is the biggest threat right now in my opinion as it suppresses motivation and activism to challenge the problem.

Israel has been consistent through the war on Hamas. They want their hostages back and they want Hamas removed from power in Gaza.

There were absolutely other contributing factors, phases, and differences between terrestrial and oceanic responses but none of which are the dominant factor - that alone is left to injection of CO.   You're understanding of events surrounding the exit of the last glacial period are again at odds with the current literature.

Although none were as rapid as human-induced climate change, most are associated with major extinction events and were invariably caused by the injection of huge volumes of carbon into the ancient atmosphere. In this meeting we explore what we can learn about our possible future from these dramatic ancient events."  Feel free to review a summary of hyperthermals using the following article: [Hyperthermals - insights into our warm future from past rapid changes in climate](http://www.thefosterlab.org/blog/2018/9/4/hyperthermals-insights-into-our-warm-future-from-past-rapid-changes-in-climate)  Note the following two well established statements that disagree with your previous comment:  (a) A key difference between what we are currently doing to the Earth System and what happened during these hyperthermal events however is the rate of current change is much much faster.   (b) Given that the rate of carbon addition during our anthropogenic hyperthermal eclipses that of the Palaeocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)...

Second of all, murder is a specific intent crime, which requires the proof of the intent to kill, absent self-defense.    I'm not sure of the event you are speaking about, but the idea that you can demonize the entire state for one bad action or several bad actions in a war is absurd.  Context is important.  How much of the time is Israel taking great efforts to minimize civilian death, and thus create the lowest civilian to combatant death ratio in any urban conflict in the last 30 years... that would be a more honest appraisal.  Also, Israel negotiated for and obtained the rescue of migrant Thai workers.  Not Israelis, Thai.  It was Hamas that beheaded many of them and kidnapped many others.  It was Israel that secured their release.  Your bias clouds your perspective, it appears.

Strikes actually *do* work -- they're difficult, painful, and hard, and inevitably require concessions, but they absolutely work -- and that's why capital owners and management are so terrified of them. In an environment where the railroad bosses couldn't just rely on the government to force workers back to work at the point of a gun, they would be much more ready to make concessions here (especially such minor ones).  And this just distracts from the facts of the matter! Biden could simply ask Congress to modify the deal to give the workers their four paid sick days and better schedule predictability, which is *all this is about*. Instead he's allowed rail bosses to hold the *entire country at ransom* and is giving them exactly what they want anyway, all to save face over the rejection of his brokered deal. It's a despicable betrayal of workers who put him in office, and it directly undermines the right to strike. It's a direct attack on the labor movement itself.

Hydroelectric power has been stalled again and again; however the theory remains with untapped potential. I, along with the masses, dont posses the capacity or capability to construct these possibilities.  You do recall correctly that hydroelectric power is far smaller in real life than my theory. We are talking GLOBAL change, but first we need a working project. With governments flaking on major projects after promising millions, just to see them fail, its hard to evaluate. Ill reply with the link tomorrow. Scotland made bold statements regarding their future projects and ambitions to Achieve pure sustainable energy sources. Including hydroelectric power...Im loving it. (I dont eat at McDeforestation of the Amazon rainforest, the line just fit).  Hydroelectric power - chew on it! The tides are constant. The Gulf Stream and others are constant. Think of the feats made which were thought impossible only years prior!! Routing the energy to a major city like NYC - thats ONE step...  Environmental impact? Mf listen, we can incorporate a layer of filters of varying sizes and mediums to filter out ocean life with minimal impact AND eliminate the need for dependency on batteries that dont exist to match this framework. (Batteries mentioned here against the main argument for solar or wind for harnessing energy during the low periods)  Rather than the idea to dismantle the nuclear arsenal (reduce the enrichment from 90+% to 5%) and fuel a city like LA for a decade (I can provide the link with math tomorrow) lets look at a long term solution. For the 2000 nukes in US arsenal (deployed, another 2000 reserve) it would fuel LA for 7.8 year according to a Stanford study.    More realistic and sustainable,  Water is literally essential to life - not to quote Zoolander. But we have to harness this sustainable resource if possible rather than burning coal to dissipate the atmosphere.   Focus on TESTING and SUPPORTING hydroelectric experiments in terms of GLOBAL SOLUTIONS rather than fighting wars over our ever-decreasing oil reserves.   Combine hydroelectric power on the waters to assist with wind farms and solar tech, use what Earth provides rather than depleting the planet.   Thank you for supporting my energy!! no need to debate my delivery. Im no face of a movement or voice of inspiration but surely a far more educated individual can invoke change or test these ideas!

Its correct that its a huge simplification but it is also useful because you can neglect the sound waves as maximum speed. With the courant levy theorem you can also neglect that effect and use a geostrophic model.   ICON uses a height scale and for all: the use smoothing algorithms to correct for topography.  Isobars don't mean that there is no gradient. The height differs according to humidity and temperature.  The layers have different thicknesses and that causes the gradient.   The geopotential is the FORCE which is necessary to lift a air package if 1kg from sea level to the height z. The geopotential is not dependent of temperature. Its more the gravity acceleration. 1 geopotential meter equals 1 m. So they don't differ that much.   But again, the pressure gradient is calculated with height.  And a tipp: don't use latitude longitude grids. They have the problem at the poles(pole problem)  that its finer there. You could use a Gaussian reduced grid or a rotating pole grid or a isocahedric grid/geodesic.   Hope that is helpful.

A conference committee is used when different versions are passed. Each house appoints members to confer with their counterparts to work out a compromise. They work together but each group of conferees votes separately. Once a deal is approved by a majority of both groups the result goes back to the House and Senate for final approval.   There is a formal process and only certain changes can be made in the conference committee. So it's a bit restrictive and has fallen into disuse in recent congresses. The common practice these days (on those rare occasions where actual legislation is passed) is to work out compromises informally. This can happen without both houses, or even one, passing a version so that congresscritters don't have to go on the record supporting or opposing the issue before the final vote.

Step 4: Get a job. college graduates on average earn over 1 million dollars more than non-college graduates, so that more than pays for itself. A $30,000 loan is nothing compared to that.  look, I'm a teacher. I love education and wish I could go to college for free for forever. But everyone who goes to college is still draining society's resources, since you have to pay for the building, salaries, electronics, etc.. If people who dropped out of college just got everything forgiven, that would actually encourage people to drop out near graduation if they didn't think they had good job prospects.  Additionally, making college no-risk is also regressive. People who don't go to college earn less money on average, so you're giving away more to people likely to earn more. And why should college grads have insurance against "bad labor markets" when poorer people don't get the same protection?  Look at how college debt is distributed in real life. 20% of it is held by people in the bottom 50% of wage earners. 30% of it is held by the people who earn above average incomes but below the 80% percentile. and 50% of all debt is held by people earning in the top 20%. To be honest, that doesn't seem like a problem to me.  What we really need to do is discourage people from going to college without a plan, and discourage people from borrowing a lot of money for useless degrees. If you really want to get a degree that doesn't pay for itself, sure go ahead, but that's on you.

For what it's worth, he admitted this under isreali detention, meaning you could argue he did this under duress, but he looked fine in the released video.  Additionally, the circumstances behind the hospital are weird. If you belive the hamas narrative, a hospital with supposedly no combatants was held to a seige in order to present it as a legitimate military target. If it was truly free of combatants you would assume that the IDF could have walked in, planted evidence, and then called the press in. Yet it was an operation that took eight days. To me there is just a level of caution the IDF took that suggests to me at the very least they thought it was held by hamas militants, stemming from the only truth we know from this incident, which is the amount of time it took.   To me it was either a legitimate military target, or was a failure in intelligence that lead to the operation which was then handled extremely poorly in a humanitarian sense and then covered up in the following days. It could also have been in between, perhaps it was both a militant base AND a legitimate hospital, and the IDF was stumped as to how to approach it, which would explain why they even allowed an ambulance to enter the premise and evacuate some people.   Either way, you probably have your own opinions about it already made up, and the sources are entirely either the hamas ministry of health, or the IDF, so we will probably never know the truth.

If they start to hear it from "their own", it's more likely to penetrate.

Some highlights:   >Beyond mentions, Id urge journalists to look at climate change as a broader phenomenon that continues to exist and affect people and the environment whether or not a single event is due to it, Chuang said. So if we look at a cold snap, the contextual reporting should address, as temperature extremes likely become more common, who will likely be most impacted? (Spoiler alert: People with the fewest resources, who are already vulnerable.) The question of whether the event is due to climate change likely should be reported in a more in-depth way that looks at extremes over time and their impact over time, rather than focusing on a single event. That ongoing reporting, ideally, can be referenced during breaking news events, but should allow journalists to provide more information than a simple mention.  And:  >Some good news: Weather is a story that journalists already tell well. Its a top reason audiences tune in to local news. And when extreme weather strikes, meteorologists and reporters at all levels perform admirably, almost without fail. Reporting the climate connection therefore finds journalists in a position of relative strength.  >In extreme weather events  hurricanes, fires, droughts, floods, heatwaves, and more  climate change is best viewed as critical context. Climate change makes these events more likely and more powerful. Extreme weather stories that fail to mention climate change should, in turn, be viewed as incomplete and perhaps inaccurate.

Current ice-core-based temperature reconstructions3,4,5 are ambiguous with respect to isolating global warming signatures from natural variability, because they are too noisy and do not include the most recent decades. By systematically redrilling ice cores, we created a high-quality reconstruction of central and north Greenland temperatures from AD 1000 until 2011. Here we show that the warming in the recent reconstructed decade exceeds the range of the pre-industrial temperature variability in the past millennium with virtual certainty (P<0.001) and is on average 1.50.4degrees Celsius (1standard error) warmer than the twentieth century. Our findings suggest that these exceptional temperatures arise from the superposition of natural variability with a long-term warming trend, apparent since AD 1800. The disproportionate warming is accompanied by enhanced Greenland meltwater run-off, implying that anthropogenic influence has also arrived in central and north Greenland, which might further accelerate the overall Greenland mass loss.

Their parents have the duty to be responsible guardians and in effect be the outsourced better judgment children and teenagers dont yet possess.   One argument for imprisonment is that a person did something wrong or evil despite that they had the capacity for reason to know they ought to do otherwise. That usually means most communities only punish adults with prison, while crimes by children lead to a state mandated guardianship, sometimes with impacts on the parents as well. Persons who are found to be adult in terms of age, but by some mental deficiency is unable to reason morally, may be put under some other form of guardianship, which can include restricted freedoms to move and thus restricted to commit further wrongs. I think in a political or moral program these distinctions have to be made.  That takes me back to voting. The adult who did a moral wrong despite the capacity not to, and serves a prison sentence, is by the premise mature. If that adult were to be denied the vote, that must be for another reason than what applies to children. I think it is possible to argue, as you do in places, that this disenfranchisement can be part of the punishment. So like we have a scale of prison terms and fines, we can add time-limited voting restrictions while punishment is served. That has to be balanced against other considerations that we want adults that have wronged to be redeemed and become moral members of the community. Sure, a person who butchered his family in cold blood is unlikely to ever fully reach that state. But there are less severe cases of moral wrong that are tougher test cases where a balancing of consequences may be the way to settle on appropriate levels.   The point is that all this is qualitatively distinct from the concept of maturity test for voting, which I think is its own issue and a can of worms with a risky slippery slope attached (mixed metaphors alert). Rather than limiting those democratic rights, I think raising the demands on certain responsibilities towards the community and its guiding symbols (like service of some sort) is the dial to adjust in order to make a christian democratic community healthier and one that persons feel a greater responsibility for, and thus their vote is central to said responsibility.

Any financial assistance that Israel provided to a nascent, pre-violence Hamas, and any financial assistance that Israel allowed to flow into Gaza during Hamas' 18 years of rule there, *completely and utterly pales,* in both scale and intent, compared to the financial and military assistance that Hamas has been provided with by Iran & other regional allies. Arguing that Likud's policies were tangentially, even directly, beneficial to Hamas' rule in Gaza at various points in time is one thing. Arguing that Hamas grew *because* of Likud, and then leaving it at that, is to obscure what Hamas is & how its allies support it to such a degree that it just derails any kind of valuable discourse on the topic.   Think of it this way: arguing that Likud "grew" Hamas is like arguing that I am actually a professional gambler, not a financial analyst, because I won a few thousand bucks at a casino once.

Originally people didn't understand politics but they did understand livestock dynamics and sheep herding apparently and so the term "bellwether" was used to describe a leading indicator.

Its critical for demonstrating that there is a customer for entrepreneurs building carbon removal solutions, Ryan Macpherson, the climate innovation and investment lead at Autodesk, told CNBC.  The danger of embracing carbon removal as a "climate action plan" is that it is often used to enable continued emissions which could be curtailed sooner, and at a lower cost.  Since the CO2 removal is all in the future, that promise is just greenwashing.  But, even if we did everything, we must be prepared to pay the price for carbon removal to claw back what has already been emitted, and also some emissions which cannot be eliminated at a "reasonable" price.  The key criterion is that we do everything that can be done to reduce emissions that costs less per ton than the most conservative (high cost) estimate of what it would take to suck carbon out of the atmosphere.  That could be several hundred dollars per ton  that is considerably more than the $100 per ton which is the standard set for purchasing a ton of carbon credit derived from carbon direct removal (CDR).  The $100/ton price is the standard set in the advance pre-purchase order that is the commitment in this private-sector climate initiative.  Relying on the future availability of cheap CDR credits is like relying on successfully treating your lung cancer in the future rather than choosing to stop smoking.

Only trump has engaged in that conduct so far.   The example you point to is a NYTimes reporter simply describing something she saw in the courtroom. What she reported on may seem unflattering to trump but will not prejudice the proceeding. At worst, it makes him seem like a sympathetic older man, so it could even play in his favor to a jury but its so innocuous that its not something that remotely comes close to anything that might prompt a gag order and again, the reporter is not a party to the case, so the court lacks jurisdiction to gag her.

The best idea I can think of is to compare the stolen wages from slavery to the predicted benefits of staving off climate change and it's considerable expensiveness by way of natural disasters.   Supposedly, a battery electric car has 19 tons CO2 equivalent of lifecycle emissions, 5 less than a gas car. With a social cost of carbon of $53, this works out to be $265, and thus given the DRC's minimum wage of $0.68/day, you get 389.7 days of work.   So apparently, the moral good of an electric car is enough to offset just over a year of slave labor.   Also worth mentioning is that this ignores that the costs from this are being pushed to others, while the benefits of it are seen in cleaner cities for you to live in. The moral value of this is far harder to estimate with this sort of logic.

But to be honest with you it seems like we are just staying the sentence another 4 years since it is pretty clear to me that Biden and other establishment democrats have no interest in really going after republicans and doing what needs to be done to fight homegrown fascism that has consolidated under the republican party banner.

All the plastic will get incorporates back into the soil, recycled into rocks etc.  The problem is all the life forms that exist on the planet today will not survive.  There will be mass extinctions because much of life will not be able to evolve fast enough to survive. Yes some life will survive and evolve into new species and this pattern will continue until the planet is destroyed (by a huge asteroid or the death of the sun).  The earth is not in danger.

The vast majority of the people making claims that the threat is existential are not scientists and they misinterpret what the science actually says. Its literally just become accepted common wisdom to say that climate change is a species extinction level threat and these people are well intentioned but totally wrong. The burden of proof is really on the people making the claims.  The biggest problem is that people literally convince themselves they cant have kids now because they think their kid will have a worse life due to climate change but the only way you can believe this is if youre profoundly ignorant about how bad the past was.

According to findings published in Nature Cities, the populations of some 15,000 cities around the country could dwindle to mere fractions of what they are now. The losses are projected to affect cities everywhere in the U.S. except Hawaii and Washington, D.C.   The way were planning now is all based on growth, but close to half the cities in the U.S. are depopulating, says senior author Sybil Derrible, an urban engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago. The takeaway is that we need to shift away from growth-based planning, which is going to require an enormous cultural shift in the planning and engineering of cities  &#x200B;  https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-023-00011-7

People want progressive policies (per pew polls) and republicans are afraid that if the electorate gets a taste of those policies, they won't want to let go and they shouldn't.

They are extremely expensive, super automated production facilities that cost billions of dollars and years to build. Im not saying that we wouldnt eventually figure it out but currently we literally import millions of chips monthly and our current manufactures capabilities, does not match foreign capabilities.    For example, the most compelling industry that probably will be life-changing for all people is ai. 100% of the chips that are used in processing ai are manufactured overseas right now. So if we lost access to Taiwanese chips, then it would most likely sit back our AI community by 5 years. While China gets ahead.

The implication is that previous experiments observing permafrost CO2 emissions got that about right, but missed even more carbon being seeped away by water under the surface, either in dissolved or particle form. How this then affects total CO2 emissions gets complicated though  it depends on what happens to that dissolved /particulate carbon once it gets flushed out into rivers and the sea, where it can be buried and lost or respired and slightly enrich the seawater carbon stock (which might in turn affect CO2 drawdown in the ocean). As they put it, the fate of the transported C is highly uncertain. The caveat to all this though, as ever with experimental/observational studies, is how much this can be extrapolated across all the permafrost region, as soil types and dynamics can widely vary and this process may happen in some soil types more than others.  &gt;Overall I think the main takeaway is that more permafrost C might well be lost than I summarise in this article, but that this extra C probably wont be directly emitted as CO2 (it may end up emitted some point later depending on seawater chemistry, or buried at sea  its hard to say). This paper also backs up the point about how very little of permafrost C ends up as methane during degradation, with them finding it almost negligible in this experiment.  Having read the paper myself too, it neglects (unlike other websites) on how their study discovered how the soil carbon is absorbed into pools and other sorts of water and dissolved into it. We knew soil carbon was released before into the atmosphere, but not into water through this method (which may release later on).  &gt;"This study was novel because we used new methods to directly track the soil carbon losses, and they were much higher than we previously thought," Schuur said. "This suggests that not only is carbon being lost throughgreenhouse gasesdirectly to the atmosphere but also dissolved in waters that flow through the soil and likely carried carbon into streams, leaves and rivers."  Gist is: potentially bad, but the article leaves out important parts of the study, which has major results for their claims in said article. Its unlikely it all pops out into the atmosphere,   (Reposting this on my main so I can have a reply here.)

Our plans include maintenance for 2  dry seasons. Probably need additional funding for anything after that. Admittedly, as of now we could provide watering, fertilization and very basic integrated pest management for the maintenance. Fungal or bacterial diseases are going to be difficult to control, our aim is to manage that through the selection and distribution of species for planting.   From a technical standpoint, I believe the project is sound and our aim is to establish each stand of trees for the long term. I appreciate your advice, indeed that's what most people overlook and think that planting is the most important.

Absolute monarchy is certainly a bad idea, but I personally find a government based on the familial model of a father being the spiritual leader of the family is better than a secular mobocracy. That being said, family should take care of one another, and as such my ideal system would be Democratic at a local and regional level (especially in the workplace), but the system in place is kept in check by a able monarch and Senate (in my ideal a sort of technocratic affair of experts in various fields).   The monarch wouldnt necessarily be automatically chosen by their birth, but instead elected by the patriarchs of the Church, and recall is allowed if it becomes clear they are not being good moral leaders. Of course, the family would be first choice, but in the way of Imperial China if you start betraying your people and bringing ruin, expect the Mandate of Heaven to be yoinked from your dynasty and granted to someone more able.

The minute Israel lets down their guard they learn the exact same lesson that ever Middle Eastern country that ever took in Palestinian refugees already learned. And that is don't turn you back on Palestinians because they've always got some terrorist organization in tow and they will stab you in the back and try to take over your country.   Palestinians love their terrorists like nobody's business. Palestinians have been cozying up with one terrorist organization after another since Israel came into existence. Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) to name a few. Now there is Hamas with help from Hezbollah over the Lebanese border and a bunch of splinter groups. More or less anyone who promised to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and hand the land over to them.  The truth is they chose violence right from the start and didn't nope out when said terrorist groups were blowing up school buses, when they attacked and killed 5 Jewish athletes at the Munich Olympics or even when they hijacked two planes and blew them up. Palestinians have LONG history of hanging tough with the terrorist groups trying to give them the land Israel sits on.  Here are the words of a man who lived on the boarder with Gaza, fought for their rights and believed them to be friends. Avida Behar, who came from the towns a kibbutz near the border with Gaza. Behars wife and son were murdered in the October 7 attack. The people of that kibbutz are mostly secular and left-wing, and saw Gazans as their neighbors.  Lying in the hospital, recovering from his wounds that forced doctors to amputate his leg, Behar said that the whole of Gaza had to be obliterated. He told Channel 13 that Gazans of all ages had taken part in the attack, and that the only way residents of Gaza border communities could go back home was if none of them were left.  He said I confess that I was one of those losers who supported and preached peace, he wrote in an Instagram post last week. For 30 years, I traveled the world to peace camps in Norway, Jordan, Israel, and the rest of the world. I had delusional dreams of a beautiful and peaceful world that was full of good and love.  On October 7 at 6:30 a.m., Meir Adoni died, he continued. A minute later, a new Meir was born. A Meir that repents his sin. A Meir who is ashamed that he was part of the delusion of the delusional Left who dont understand that we are surrounded by extreme Islam monsters who have no interest in peace and normalcy, and only want to burn us alive.

Also your concerns about the rise of displaced immigrants causing right wing parties to win is very silly - almost all immigrant groups have voted overwhelmingly left wing. In the event a right wing candidate wins, it would be due to the shitstorm they wreak onto the country they immigrate to causing people to flock towards right wing causes.   The population boom is not going to create food scarcity. The west has a massive food waste problem, in fact. Farming is getting more efficient.

You can argue that a land value tax on titleholders is not intrinsically unjust, but I think it is at least decently clear that taxing titleholders who actually live on and use the land themselves, or their family does, is effectively the government robbing them of what they own.  I think the whole idea of the state having a intrinsic title to tax ownership habitually is problematic at best anyway. For example, if you buy a house, and the government taxes you, over a period of years, 100% of your propertys assessment value, doesnt that mean they levied a 100% income tax on you?

Of the world population, 31% are Christian, 25% are muslim. Jews are only 0.2%. That means, that all other countries can remain essentially ethno religon states without trying very hard. Ireland- 84% Christians, USA- combine the different versions of christianity (protestants, mormons, catholics)- 74% are Christians. UAE- 90% are Sunni Muslims, Saudi Arabia- same. All countries are essentially ethno religous. The Jews being such a small precentage of the worlds population are the only ones who have to worry about it through immigration laws, and they're the only ones who get heat about it.  I do think there's good reason for Jews to worry about remaining the majority. As long as antisemitism still exists, there will always be concerns that the radicals antisemites will gain power. Unfortunately I don't believe that we can trust other people to keep us safe, as proven by history, and I don't believe that if Israel will lose their jewish majority than it can still be a safe haven for Jews. It wasn't before. Before WW2 no country Muslim or Christian was welcoming to Jews who tried to flee, and even after. My grandparents didn't come to Israel from their respective Arab and European countries due to Zionism. They came because Israel was the only country that welcomed them. Other countries, while they allowed immigration, it was limited and they didn't have time to wait and remain refugees.  That said, of course that I believe that there should be freedom of religon and from religon and equal rights to all people in Israel, Jewish and otherwise.   *do you think Israel has the right to annex the West Bank and Gaza into Israel?*    Gaza and the west bank are two different stories. Despite the world saying that Israel Occupies Gaza, it's not the case. There's a blockade. A similar blockade to Saudi Arabia has against Yemen. West Bank is a different story. Does Israel has a right to annex, maybe according to the law. Should we annex? Hard no. I support the two state solution.   *If so, then how does the influx of the \~3 million Palestinians affect the status of that ethno-state?*   I don't think Israel should annex, but should they annex, Israel will no longer be a Jewish state. It would essentially be a one state solution. I know some people support it, thinking we can give citizenships to 3 million palestinians, lift the barriers and live happily ever after in co-existance, but I think reality is more complicated than this. I think one state solution, with two groups fighting for control of one country will end in civil war. There's civil war in countries with muslim majority, between Sunni and Shia muslims, there's no reason to think it would be different between Jews and Muslims. I think one state will only bring more war, at least at the current conditions, which is why I believe two states is better. I also don't believe that such a state can remain secular and a good place for Jews to live in (or for atheists palestinians for that matter) or that it will remain a safe haven and a welcoming place for Jews who might face antisemitisem and persecution elsewhere.

Freshwater fish are dying off in record numbers, trees in Canadas forests are dying and burning and replanting is becoming less and less successful because of how long dry and hot the summers are. Many forests either wont grow back or will switch from wetter forests to drier forests or become prairie. The species which depend on them will likely see mass die offs as a result.  So die offs are happening now, many causes by temperature change, habitat loss and fracturing and human development.  So is it possible that our ecosystems are not robust enough to respond to pressures that maybe they once could have handled?

Unfortunately at present, Palestinians given any amount of land have said over and over they will not accept until the state of Israel is demolished.  These people could prosper under their current government if they invested in them, but the way I see it is this: Iran and other islamic regimes literally use the suffering of the Palestinians in order to help their cause of getting rid of Israel. A democratic western state near them is invaluable to other western countries and detrimental to those regimes. That is why no matter where they go, the people aren't absorbed by or helped by any local government. That is why they are still refugees in several middle eastern countries, they make great angry militants that the rest of the world will feel for.  Israel cannot absorb them as they have stated they will not love peacefully under their democratic government (though 2 million other Arabs do, how do you decipher which will and which won't if Israel was to absorb them) and other countries in the middle east also refuse to give them citizenship, so they have lived in refugee status for 75 years without any way to prosper. I am no politician and thus do not know all possible paths forward, but there is no world war to get rid of the poison that is islamic regimes that want Sharia law enforced all over the world and thus I do not know or see any easy path forward as so many in the west claim to see.

Although it was technically an absolute monarchy, after 1905 it was a rather limited monarchy - a lot more limited than Stalin's USSR in particular. The Duma wasn't "a faction of the rich only" at all, there were plenty of socialists there, although it didn't have that much power indeed. (Yet, arguably more power than the Supreme Soviet, which only rubber-stamped party decisions).  (National) minorities and women yes, true (bar Stalin's deportation of the entire peoples: the rights are not worth much if they can be taken away on a whim). Peasants, on the other hand, strictly no: they were almost enslaved and had less rights than in (late) tsarist Russia; most were unhappy and never as productive as before the revolution.  Generally, being Marxists, Bolsheviks didn't believe in national identity, but they believed in classes. So, instead of suppressing ethnic minorities, they suppressed the classes they didn't like, and as it happens, in a more ruthless way.

There are some projects that do this kind of thing for specific applications e.g. the (now outdated) MARGO project for reconstructing LGM sea-surface temperature, but this is the exception rather than the rule. There are also big data repositories like PANGAEA where a lot of this data is stored, but (as far as I'm aware) they're purely there for storage so you can't just search by geography/time, you need to already know the paper reference.   Your best bet is to find palaeoclimate review papers for your region and age of interest, which will collate the various studies that have been carried out in that region/time. If you want the raw data, you can go through the references to find the original papers. The raw data (in table form) will generally not be in the paper itself but it's good practice to include it in the supporting/supplementary information which you can find on the online version of the paper. Note that "good practice" does not equal "widely done".  **Edit:** See /u/jwaves11's comment. The NOAA database looks like a really useful resource in addition to review papers.

If Clinton's turnout had been just 1% higher in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio then she could have prevented Donald Trump from winning the election and appointing three pro-life Justices to the Supreme Court.  Slightly higher turnout in 2000 could have prevented us from losing two Supreme Court Seats.

Whether they just came or applied for amnesty the one thing that unites them is the desire to be part of our economy. They came here and not to another country because they know they can work in this country. The only way to eliminate illegal migration is to eliminate the incentive of being able to work and provide for their families.  Make the hiring of undocumented illegal workers a crime that actually is enforced. The jailing of a few CEOs and board of directors and a few local business owners will send the message that the days of use of the people to prop up the profits of their businesses is over.  Eliminate what draws these people and they will go elsewhere. Keep incentivizing them to come and they will continue to come.   To those who think that the existing laws are enough are right in that many of the laws are just not being enforced.  But the existing laws are not sufficient as shown by the rash of new immigration laws being introduced and passed nationwide in many states and communities.

The Arab countries neighboring Palestine can't stop Israel militarily, they don't have the resources to fight an US backed IDF. Syria and Iraq are in a mess, Jordan is another western outpost and if they tried they would probably lose territory to Israel. The same for Egypt.  They also don't have nukes, while the Israelis have plenty.   There's not much they can do except some diplomatic and commercial retaliations.  Egypt could embargo them, and obviously not accept the madness with the refugee camp in Sinai. Turkey has the manpower to do something, but they would need to cross Syria/Lebanon to do so or promote an amphibious landing, and that would be a catastrophic failure.

Basically, they blame Jews for all the problems in the world and take this hate out in Israel, and Jews outside of Israel.   Saying you are preaching Non-violence is disingenuous. First, the anti-Israel protests begins while the October 7th massacre was still ongoing.  Before Israel had invaded Gaza. Clearly, this was in support of Palestinian violence, not a reaction to the invasion.  Second, you never hear any protest against Hamas, or calling for the hostages to be released. If you were truly against violence, you should be protesting Hamas who has been firing missiles into Israel for the past almost 20 years.

It's not part of a state. There would be a conflict of interest if the seat of the FEDERAL government was also a state.   On a basic level you have to get that the United States is 50 separate countries that each give up a bit of their power to be unified under one Federal government. The States have certain rights and powers and then a select amount of rights and powers are ceded to the federal government. If DC was both the seat of the Federal government AND a state it would essentially be the only state that didn't cede rights to the federal government and it would give the federal government a vote in how they operate themselves (a conflict of interest).

By July, when sea ice should be approaching its maximum winter coverage, there was an area of ice missing that was bigger than Algeria  the worlds 10th largest country.    When the annual maximum extent arrived  early  it was the smallest on record by a wide margin.   This made 2023 the second record-breaking year in a row, continuing the recent erratic swings in sea ice cover that had otherwise been preceded by several decades of steady, gradual increase.

You can be politically left and have conservative values such as being religious and anti-abortion, and politically right leaning but with liberal social viewsbut everyone is being led into homogenous boxes.       If you want a conspiracy theoryI think that this division has been deliberately sown to try and stop individuals making their own choices on each issues.  The population is more easily led if they have been divided into 2 teams and depending on your team you need to adopt all the views of the team or you will be shunned from the herd (eg RINO).  I am far left politically and many will then make assumptions on my views on a myriad of subjects when all it means is that I think society has an obligation to provide safety nets for the disadvantaged.  I am Australian but you have one of the best Presidential candidates that I have seen in RFK Jr.     there is another choice rather than Biden or Trump (which is like choosing between arsenic or strychnine). Listen to one of RFKs interviews on YouTube...you may be pleasantly surprised.  Both of the major parties have actively tried to cancel him by labelling him an anti-vaxer.  Cancel culture is a dangerous weapon used to shut down anyone who questions and thinks for themselves.  If everyone broke out of their boxes you could make the major parties more accountable and have to explain their policies rather than leaning on how much they can make you hate the other side.

Capitalism with a carbon tax, set at a sufficient level and earmarked for carbon removal. Or capitalism with a cap and trade system which in short order goes negative.  Centrally planned economies cannot efficiently allocate resources. This means we would end up wasting resources on expensive solutions and take longer to solve the problem. Note that the most progressive social democracies are still capitalistic.  By treating each individual as a node in a global neural net (as in free exchange, or capitalism) we are able to solve value problems with greater accuracy. But to get the right result we need to ask the neural net the right question. That means we need to incentivize carbon reduction. Otherwise you end up with an externality (as is the case now.)

Bombs can never make people like you.  One of the best ways to kill an idea is showing a competing idea is better. If you manage to root out Hamas now, that victory will only be temporary if you don't make life better for Palestinians under a more reasonable government. It's easy to pacify a population living in relative luxury, and next to impossible to pacify a population of starving people.   People who don't have hope, only hate from generations of oppression will have nothing to live for other than finding new and innovative ways to kill you. Palestinian resistance has only become more violent and desperate as time has gone on.   If Israel crushes Hamas, then makes Gaza a relative paradise under a secular government, they may be able to kill the idea of Hamas, but if Gaza stays in ruins and people are oppressed and starving you won't have peace until you kill them all.

There are some scholars who suggest, looking at genetic data, that a large number of Jews in the Roman and post Roman era took Italian wives. I do not know enough about this to comment meaningfully, its worth looking into maybe. However en masse intermarriage would not be necessary to corroborate my point. Sporadic intermarriage, over the course of 2000 years, would suffice. Claiming that Yiddish speaking Jews of the 20th century were somehow equivalent to the ancient Israelites of antiquity, in culture or politics or mores, is a ridiculous thing.   2. This is sort of a ship of Theseus thing isnt it? If little things change and little compromises are made, regarding a groups conception of itself and its relation to other people, over thousands of years, does the end product bare any real resemblance to the beginning? Its a fine question. The difference between the Jews and the Palestinians in this regard: the Palestinians are the people who stayed. Many of their ancestors were Jewish, or Christian, or Christians who had previously been Jews, or Muslims who had married Christians or Jews. The point is they were there, in the land, assimilating and assimilating within people who came to the land, remaining there. The Jews on the other hand spent their history in other places, assimilating into other cultures in every sense. By the time they arrived in Haifa in the 20th century, they were very much foreigners.

And yeah, I started a list of over 200 law changes/proposals so far; and just started going to wetland town hall meetings. Theyve helped provide an inside look and a broader perspective; so I can tackle these issues from a smarter angle. The things people try to justify permits over is utterly infuriating and so destructive to our future. I encourage other loraxes to participate in the meetings. What we need is extremely bias loraxes cross-checking the decisions of councils everywhere. (Not just what one town wants but a very stubborn and loving Guardian Council to knock down destructive proposals that are always in defense of the best water, wilderness and air quality and have the authority to say no).   I agree that most scenarios arent justified by a tree for a tree replacement solution and council members often think thats enough to make it right. I couldnt disagree with them more. Theres so much to consider (oxygen production, soil production, carbon reduction, moisture retention, habitat for numerous species, root networks, fungi, beauty, etc.). Their replacements can take decades or centuries to mature and are often planted apart in regions with lawn maintenance or concrete (they should tear up more concrete and allow trees to be clustered closer togetherbringing in compost, soil and other vegetation to support it. That right there could be 14 species in a 15 sq foot zone).   I think rainbeds and landscaping overall could have more heart but a lot of landscaping is done on a budget so if they operate and receive approvals on budget minimums then why not raise the minimum requirements. 7+ species in a 5 sq ft zone seems like a fair and aesthetically pleasing number. A lot of places will plant just 1 bush for 20 feet.   As far as your invasive tree question goes, Id say yes; in order to get a permit, there must be a plan to replace them with enough trees of a different variety in the area to offset any lost benefits. When involving the town, people are directed towards the proper solutions and resources. If its invasive, my guess is the town will be happy to work with the property owner. Perhaps they could even get 250 residents to plant trees near forest lines on their property or have a smaller number of residents cluster larger quantities closer together on more barren properties. As for wetlands, however, we should not be disrupting those areas, period. And Im inclined to say zero permits for anything disruptive until the properties must be demolished and handed back over to nature.   We also remove trees that are ready to come down because of rot and take them off-site but ecosystems need them; we need better rotting tree laws. They produce wonderful homes and nutrients for the ground and future trees of that area. Just like whales of the ocean, a beached whale should be cleaned of trash and brought back deep into the sea so that it can feed other species for 70 years or so.    As far as pests go, yes Id remove the pests. Hoping we can come up with some less toxic or non-toxic solutions. And if it needs to be incinerated, then so be it.  As far as tree lines go: this is where the next generational planting should be implemented. Near existing trees there will be additional planting at the quarter, half and three quarter life cycles. So when the primary tree falls sick and is removed, the area wont be empty. Planning should be more around tree cycles and less about adapting the trees to us.

Aside from apartment or condo blocks, over half of the land being used for housing is being paved into streets, and over a third of whats left is useless grass lawns.  There are problems beyond agriculture that are contributing far more waste and ghg than agriculture.

If you read through my comment history you'd see that I (probably) agree with you. Doesn't mean that you get to avoid providing sources or statements to support your opinion, however. This subreddit is focused on the science-side of things when it comes to climate change, so sources are rightly expected when engaging.  &#x200B;  Your question is much too wide for anyone to give it any real answer or thought. There's a lot of thinkers who are involved in discussions about collapse, and the general opinion comes down to: "We don't know when it will be or how it will happen, but we can assume based on trends." And not all of those thinkers even have the same idea or opinion about how a collapse will look or be, it is an entire subject of it's own that precedes even climatology. Frankly, it might happen. It might not happen. It's a rather divise topic.  &#x200B;  However I don't want to leave  a question like this unanswered from my perspective either, so I'll say this: I personally largely believe that collapse is a moral choice we can still make as a civilisation. Am I optimistic based on current trends? Far from it. But that's why I push for action, I want to be proven wrong and thus I push to prolong this civilisation in an assistance to make it transition. I don't think anyone can say it's too late, at least not yet. I also tend to lean more towards collapse being a slower process. The system of our civilisation is extremely advanced, so I believe it may very well cannibalize itself to stay afloat longer. We'll see large swaths of people die and civil strife before a collapse occurs, sadly. People tend to forget that there are events leading to a collapse, and those are usually full of suffering in their own right. When do I think it'll happen, if it does? I don't know. Maybe 2030. Maybe 2040. Maybe any decade in the future, maybe even centuries ahead. No one knows, and until we actually "know", we should push for action so that it hopefully never even happens.

Even occupied populations don't get to do anything that they want in the name of resistance. Just to take the argument to the extreme - imagine if Palestinians would go into every settlement, kill, rape, torture every man woman and child there. morally it doesn't make sense. also international law doesn't support it.  More specifically - when an occupied population "resists" they have to obey the IHL - that includes things like - being discriminate to civilians. This essentially means that they aren't allowed to attack civilians at all, even if they are settlers. they aren't allowed to throw huge stones at driving cars. they aren't allowed to kidnap people, or enter a house and kill a family.. you know, all of that stuff that they sometimes do. As you say, even if we accept that the settlements are illegal, it is only a crime of the state, and not of the settlers. the settlers moving into houses is legal. what's illegal would be the IDF maintaining these houses. In fact, there is an argument to be made about the illegal outposts by Israeli law being legal under international law, cause what's illegal is only the state encouraging people to move into settlements...  This is the most basic thing that I think could change your view.

I dont get what's missing for people to respond to this like "holy shit! I really need to stop burning fuel. We all do. Because I want to survive and live in a planet with the sound of life. The absence of that sound where it belongs is horrifying enough but knowing it's permanent.  what is worth fighting against more than your own extinction? When we start real focused work on restoring the climate, then the climate movement will have started.

Love Bernie to death, but I am pretty firm in the stance that no one over 60 should be running for office above the local level. Of course, i will still vote for the best of two options if I have to.  Edit: I'm not sure why people think I arbitrarily want to get out older candidates I don't like and promote Pete Buttigieg for some reason.  Our Congress has an average age of 60+.  We need broader perspectives in our legislature than people in mid-to-late stages of life.  It is too easy for encumbents to get entrenched, to the point where they can ignore taking popular platforms in lieu of acting in self-interest.  Obviously, I don't think Bernie fits that description, but he is the exception that proves the rule.

Read the link I sent you in the last message which is an independent Jewish publication:   In a statement about Saturdays attack, Hamas directly referenced Jewish prayer at the site, calling it an act of aggression that had reached a peak. Hamas specifically mentioned the blowing of shofars at the complex, as well as the sprinkling of a red cows blood  which Jewish texts state is a precursor to the construction of the Third Temple  as proof of their belief Israel plans to destroy the mosque and the entire compound, justifying the attack.   The reality is, Palestinians have no other means, look at the great march of return, peaceful protest gets you shot by Isreali snipers.   Isreal does not act in good faith. Even during cease-fires, settlement construction continues illegally, blockade resumes illegally. People in the West Bank get illegally detained or worse.

Also there is a video of a workshop where Israelis are taught to edit Wikipedia to phrase things in a way that pushes their narrative, this is documented.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t52LB2fYhoY - the organiser literally says we want to make sure what is written is balanced and Zionist in nature which is a bit of an oxymoron.

Biden's "supporters" are not the roaring crowds that personalities like Trump and Bernie get. They're typically not devoted fans who crow online about what "their" candidate has done. They generally don't feel strongly enough to try and convert friends and family.   Biden's supporters simply think that he's a relatively competent administrator. He has made major mistakes, no doubt - particularly in his handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan - but on a day to day level the government functions and has somebody at the top who will make reasonable decisions and defer to experts when appropriate.   Biden's supporters don't view politics as a sport, and don't view themselves as on a "team." They're not rooted *for Biden*, they're simply seeking adequate leadership for one of the highest roles in government.

It would make them feel safe and secure. They already got the brainwashing which used to keep women voluntarily in line (mostly) and are terrified of the world and intellectual responsibilities.   I'm running this year in an incredibly Evangelical district. I had genuinely not understood exactly how bad it was until I had this woman come up to me after a speech. She was early 50s, tops, well-dressed and mentally present. She seemed so normal. Then she asked whether I didn't think all of today's problems were because girls were going to college where they all get radicalized. I assume she meant feminism and climate change.   A guy at the next meeting said "we're losing our kids when they don't get a good conservative foundation. Statistics show more than 80% of them who go to college come out believing in climate change, and they never come back." When a bunch of people go to learn more about their world and nearly all of them come out believing in climate change... your deduction is they're being brainwashed? Does learning to read graphs qualify as brainwashing now? Granted, the guy runs a network of conservative private schools but still has his wife home school their kids, so he pretty clearly has no problem with cognitive dissonance.   These are the people I have been meeting and I knew it was going to be rough trying to get them to see sense going in. We keep importing retirees, so my district will be red for the next 700 years and someone has got to change the Republican party itself. For people who treat politics like a sport, they don't care what the ideas are, only whether the right person is saying them or whether they are presented with the right words. If Trump came out in support of the Green New Deal tomorrow, they'd find a way to talk themselves around. So I've got to try but, God help me, I had no idea it was *this* bad even among wealthy, educated people. I had assumed they were single issue voting on money. No. So very no.

It's nothing more than sandcastles that they're trying to uphold. And even then like you say they fight "shadow" wars to exploit the "rules" in place. IMO the only thing those "rules" have done is make war and international conflicts more underhanded. Lions are still lions and mice are still mice.  On your comments, Iran interfered by funding Palestine so Israel does have the right based on "rules" to retaliate. Israel purposedly went after Iranian generals in Syria. It wasn't some sort of random event. What was it looking for? I'm not the one calling the shots so I can't say. But I can give you my opinion and that is that either a) They were warning Iran to backoff, b) They were trying to escalate the situation with Iran to declare full-on war with them. I think the latter may be more likely given that during the back and forth it seemed like Iran tried to deescalate the conflict by trying to downplay one of the attacks it received from Israel instead of retaliating with more force.  But the truth of the matter remains, that because Hamas is hiding amongst civilians, there is no "protected" zone in Gaza based on "rules". Israel can literally wipe the entire region to oblivion. I don't think China or Russia (who are the lions who could oppose Israel) would care enough to get involved.   It's clear as day Hamas is not going to win this war. They picked a fight they had no chance in. What is happening though, which in my opinion is concerning, is all these people who have no stake in the matter \*specifically\* becoming Hamas supporters in western countries as a call for justice. It's not really going to narrow the gap between a mouse and a lion, but it is creating discord in the western world.   And this is just my gut feelings and not really based on facts, but I personally think it's weird how much Israel/Palestine content we've been fed. In comparison, when Haiti's government collapsed the other weeks and Haiti became lawless, barely anything was said about it at least in my area.

Taking responsibility is doing a lot of things and will definitely get good support from everyone. Hamas is using Israel as justification and vice versa. Now it is a game of chicken and egg but in this case, who really want to make a real change in the region. Hard answer: None  The rest of the Arab world would love to have stability on that side because they want to focus to fight amongst themselves and/or with Iran.  You still fail to understand - Hamas is having power because there is no alternative to the people. If there is - and I mean good alternative, they will change. I am involved in various humanitarian effort locally for Palestine and more or less, this is their sentiment based on what I talked. If heavy handed control is what it needs, why not? As long as it is fair for both side. Right now it is not and heavily in favor one side. UN is useless as ever.  Looking realistically - what can a Palestinian do? They lack resources, they lack proper communication, the lack proper living condition - and Hamas and Israel is not helping the situation and yet we push all the blame to the people.

To insist that either you do an operation that many are saying will be a humanitarian bloodbath or you completely abandon Israel and the Jewish people seems like an extreme black and white view of the matter that not everyone agrees with.  Also Biden isn't even wholly against an operation in Rafah, just one that is reckless and puts too many civilian lives in danger. He's asked for a plan for months and Bibi hasn't provided one he approved of. At the very least to say that Biden trying to moderate is tantamount to abandoning Israel (or loving Hamas as Ben-Gvir seems to want to suggest) isn't really helpful.

Several parties in the German parliament have had members who have been rambling about nuclear energy since the election 2021.  However, the only party which has an official pro nuclear policy is the AfD, but then the AfD is a total basket case, filled with white supremacists, conspiracy theorists and an official "There is no climate change" and "there are no international treaties" policy.   The CDU and FDP have been wise enough not to adopt an official pro nuclear line as a party. And there will not be a majority in Germany for the forseeable future.  Apart from that, this neverending nuclear debate is a silly distraction and at best leads to divestment from renewables. Just days ago, a publication investigated the possible role that nuclear could play in reducing global emissions to zero. The bottom line: Nuclear is irrelevant in any scenario.

The indigenous populations were serially driven from the desert by climate changes, most rarely produced economic surpluses (although a handful of areas were more successful), and were not likely able to support the caloric needs of the farmers long term in most years. Sedentism was likely the result of changing patterns of foraging instead of intensive agriculture.   A return to indigenous farming methods would struggle to support more than the populations that ebbed and flowed at different times in the region. So the indigenous populations of the Southwest were pretty diverse and generally most or all lost their way of life at various times as well.   The ecological footprint of the region is larger than the region itself in modern times, and was likely so for some or many at different times for indigenous peoples as well.

Fission is publically perceived as unsafe, statistics or not. What really counts to people is how spectacular the failure mode is.  2. Plants take around a decade to build and face resistance every step of the way. That's more than most politians want to deal with and they have to balance possibly not even being in office long enough to see it through against more achievable ideas.  3. Suitable sites are in short supply in many countries. The public will to tolerate any level of natural threat to a fission plant is shrinking if anything.  4. Uncertain economics. In theory fission is extremely cheap. But the capital/maintaince cost and free falling competitive price per electric unit thanks to renewables makes the business case difficult. Where I live our most recent plant involved the government tying itself into a garantueed price that is widely understood to well above even the current market rate. This makes fission look like a dinosaur.  5. Worldwide there are no permanent waste disposal arrangements. That's leaving potentially big problems for future generations.  6. Fuel supply seems low for a worldwide shift. The proven supply for current demand is about 60 years. There may or may not be alot more undiscovered but it hurts fission compared with most forms of energy, especially those that have essentially unlimited fuel supplies such as wind and even fusion if that ever happens.  7. Fission by nature is very inflexible and it's big advantage is baseload. If grid batteries advance in the way people are hoping for these projects become riskier when that baseload can be supplied by much more flexible means. The plant you approve today may not even have a purpose in 10 years.

We are more than likely near peak man-made emissions and the role of natural emissions like the clathates and methane lakes is severely overplayed in the news cycles. They could really ramp up over the next few decades but we -should- all well be on the way to decarbonizing by then.  I don't have much hope myself because of all the other things at play besides emissions but there really is hope out there with regard to renewables, especially in the developed countries which account for the most emissions.

Even 20 years is a bit of stretch. 50 or 100 year periods are the most relevant for what will actually happen.  gavin   &#x200B;  I'm a layman, so this may be wrong but: While methane does contribute quite a bit to radiative forcing, it often degrades before the full effect of that can be felt on the climate system. In other words, the system isn't in equilibrium while methane enters the system.

However, methane degrades into CO2 so it does add to the long-tail of risks.   &#x200B;  In comparison to CO2, methane has a pretty short lifetime. The lifetime of methane is around 12.4 years, while CO2 lasts 20-200 years. However, to remove the last of that carbon dioxide it can take several hundred thousand years.   &#x200B;  For more info, read this link:  [https://unfccc.int/news/new-methane-signs-underline-urgency-to-reverse-emissions](https://unfccc.int/news/new-methane-signs-underline-urgency-to-reverse-emissions)

You might see it as Clinton getting 2.9m more votes and its just the electoral college thats the problem.   But when faced with a president Donald trump, 65.8m voter for her and 164.2 million voters decided they didnt care or actively voted against her.   Thats not just the electoral college that failed you, its the apathy of the average American voter thats the real problem.  It can be excused once but if you do the it again with similar numbers thats the vast majority of the American people choosing to hand Trump a dictatorship.

Air strikes and bombs are used to make the battlefield less of an advantage to Hamas (for example, destroying or flooding the guerrilla tunnels, destroying hideouts and rocket launcher bases).   Fighting only with special forces, rifles and tank units would prolong the war by an absurd amount and it would make it more difficult to actually kill terrorists and destroy their military bases spread all over the city. And guess what? Civilian casualties would be incredibly high even so, because Hamas also wear civilians' clothes. IDF soldiers would even make more mistakes probably, given how stressful it would be to fight Hamas in a battlefield Hamas knows better.  I am so sorry, I wish Israel had in stock thousands of ultra-precise weapons that instantly distinguish by themselves a terrorist from a civilian, like Iron Man suits or Yondu's whistle arrows, but they do not.  Many, many terrorists could be hiding among the innocent civilians  waving white flags, right now, that will make cleansing Hamas from this world even more difficult.  War gear sadly evolved in the direction of explosive power, even if bombs are a lot more precise than the ones used in WW2.   IDF killed less civilians then bombs dropped, they are actually doing the least errors possible, believe it or not.  With the bombs they used, if they really wanted to commit a "gEnOcIDe" (like they are being accused of by people who don't freaking know what a genocide is), the deaths among palestinians would be far more.

The 0.1% that control all of the world's wealth and create almost all of the world's pollution through the industries they own which could transition to more sustainable and less massively damaging methods of production *(but which won't, because that wouldn't maximise profits)* should be funding these.  We shouldn't be guilting the average person in to spending what very little money they've been able to scrounge from their rich overlords on these sorts of projects.  Not only are their contributions a pointless drop in the ocean, but it suggests that they have the responsibility to pay for this. At best, it's the average person's responsibility to band together to force whichever rich people run their particular country to fund these sorts of projects on a large sustainable scale.  Organise nationwide strikes until these climate measures are implemented, because unfortunately the only way to get the rich that own us all to do anything is to hurt their profits.  I say that, but I don't expect it to happen. So, the only way these necessary changes will happen on any scale that actually matters is for us to wait until these issues begin to threaten the rich's profits, at which point they'll take steps to continue maximising their profits - which will hopefully be beneficial climate action for us all.  Bottom line: We can't fix anything big long term by donating what little money we have to climate action groups, etc, we the people of the world need to take this straight to the door of the rich that own us all, and force them to take action by threatening their massive hoards of wealth

In exchange, the municipality does away with the need to build stupid infrastructure to service hugely idiotic places like the Denver Tech Center. More living in the city instead of offices in the city with preposterous highway infrastructure to move people from home to office. Roads are for essential workers, school transport, supply transport, and tourists/vacationers. Even schools should figure out  how to maintain some of the aspects of remote classroom work they were forced to do in lockdown. This would allow schools to better distribute their usage of the transport that is built. Some schools would be Monday Tuesday on-site. Others Tuesday Wednesday, etc.  this is just a first cut of ideas. I think theres a lot more here.    Who would be against this? Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan.  Why?

The proposed stated of security arrangements made in Camp David were very different than what was presented at Oslo, with Oslo allowing Israel complete impunity in area C, but the camp David offer outlines specifically what would be the limits of Israeli power in the west bank.   To quote:   >The Israeli negotiators proposed that Israel be allowed to set up radar stations inside the Palestinian state, and be allowed to use its airspace. Israel also wanted the right to deploy troops on Palestinian territory in the event of an emergency, and the stationing of an international force in the Jordan Valley. Palestinian authorities would maintain control of border crossings under temporary Israeli observation. Israel would maintain a permanent security presence along 15% of the Palestinian-Jordanian border. Israel also demanded that the Palestinian state be demilitarized with the exception of its paramilitary security forces, that it would not make alliances without Israeli approval or allow the introduction of foreign forces west of the Jordan River, and that it dismantle terrorist groups.  From [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit?wprov=sfla1)  To paint that as being the same as annexation of its territories is just ridiculous.

They have the right to hold whatever opinion they wish to and the majority of the whole group have the right to identify those views as dangerous or harmless and react accordingly.

They have not won the popular vote in 20 years. They increasingly convolute the law and reject the constitution and erode the core principles of our liberal democratic republic to try to retain power anyway.   They absolutely did NOT make a mistake.   They want one of two things to happen: 1) Trump wins. Project 2025 quickly consolidates power in the executive branch. The march toward a theocratic authoritarian and illiberal society speeds up.   2) Trump loses.  This means the nation needs another dose of 2020 attacks on our election system as "rigged" and continued chaos and dysfunction in Congress and the courts. The goal is for fewer people to vote because most people vote for Democrats. (See the popular vote commentary above) By destroying faith in elections, the judiciary and the legislative system, the "answer" becomes centralized power for an authoritarian executive instead of diffused power among millions of Americans. Apathy in the majority, illiberalism in the few who care.   That's the plan. Trump is perfect for that plan because being an obvious criminal, he sows distrust in government competence, and being malleable, he's also easy to drive.    The former president on trial while running for reelection is just what the antiliberal right wants.  Mistakes were made. But. Backing Trump isn't one by the far right, if you understand their long term goals.

FFS, the GOP introduced a bill to remove any and all restrictions on child labor and that includes hour restrictions, safety restrictions (12 year olds working heavy machinery in mines is apparently what they are going for), and the best part? Remove any and all liability for the corporation if they are seriously permanently injured or die.  They have also convinced the majority that somehow if someone is on welfare they are lazy and is full of people living the high life on food stamps and cash. Cash is $200 bi weekly only for single parents limited at like 2 years through a lifetime and $200 a month in food stamps. Meanwhile, Trumps businesses alone took tens of millions in PPP loans during covid that was supposed to be used to pay workers, prevent layoffs, and he laid them off and pocketed their money.

In so doing, they drew attention away from their own place in the climate change problem.  I wouldn't say that what those companies are doing is totally independent of market demand. Instead, I'd note that it's next to impossible to mobilize enough individuals to actually fix the problem, not just because of disagreements but also because of money issues. Consider how many households in America could not afford to buy an electric vehicle today, replace their furnace with a heat pump, ditch that gas stove.  Who's going to pay to put solar on rooftops? Can individuals really get their electric companies to migrate *all* of their power generation to something carbon free?  How do we get to the point where people demand that the steel in their car was created in a carbon free plant? The food they eat was harvested by electric vehicles, powered with clean power? Their mail and packages delivered via electric trucks?  Climate change is not about squeezing out a little efficiency, but rather a complete shift to *almost* zero greenhouse gas emissions (with the remainder going through some kind of sequestration). Without policies that make EVs and residential solar cheaper (as we see in the Build Back Better Act!) and regulations requiring the rest of industry to stop emitting carbon on some time scale, we'll just never get there regardless of what *millions* of individuals do.

Some people will listen to some arguments, some to others, and some to not a single one. A big part of a discussion with a denier is listening to try and sus out WHY they disbelieve and tuning your approach to the ideas they already acknowledge as true.        If they are Libertarian in leaning and focus on **business**, you can talk about how climate change is going to make coffee and chocolate far more expensive, or drive it entirely extinct. You can talk about the Tragedy of the Commons and ask "do you believe that everything has a cost? If so, why doesn't the environment have a cost?". Talk about how the Hudson river used to literally catch fire from all the illegal dumping, and the massive efforts that went into cleaning it up. Talk about the Ozone Hole and how international regulation solved it and DIDN'T "kill business'. People still have refrigerators and spray cheese, though at the time that was the dire predictions. You can point out scientific papers that describe how various pollution translates into a sicker (less productive) populace. By not supporting environmental efforts, they are guaranteeing a future America (or wherever) a larger number of people on disability rather than working.     If they dislike **Immigrants**, talk about how as the world heats up places on the equator will become death zones, unable to support human life. Look at what happened to Pakistan this last year, with temperatures (51C/124 F!) If your country became unlivable, what would you do? That's right, migrate to another, cooler, country. Like here. If you think immigration is bad now, just wait. In the US, the Pentagon and CIA are already deeply concerned about mass refugee/migrations due to climate change.([Here is an example](https://mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu/event/pentagon-climate-change-and-war-charting-rise-and-fall-us-military-emissions)) It promises mass chaos, deep stress lines in supply chains and to provide excuses for war in the name of protecting the lives of their people.  If they dislike **the cost** of greening everything, you can talk about how Green tech comes down in price dramatically as: a) research improves and b) mass production and mass adoption demand better, cheaper options available to more people. Government subsidies and basic research for green technologies is critical and often contested as wasteful by conservative leaders, but if we don't do this research do you think it will go unresearched? Absolutely not and that is 100% what we are already seeing. Research patents on many green technologies are going to countries that ARE investing in green energy and climate mitigation. China and Germany both solidly acknowledge Global climate change and are securing a lion's share of solar, hydro and wind power patents.  Even if they didn't believe in global climate change, ignoring the vast implications of allowing countries like China to own the patents on future electrical generation is long term stupid.      Some people don't deny climate change, but fiercely believe that **technology will solve it**. That technology? Needs to be researched though, and you can't start it, or start funding it, when it's too late. Science takes a million baby steps to reach a breakthrough and you have to fund it \_now\_ and keep funding it, not denying or downplaying it.     Some people deny it from a political view, arguing it is made up by Democrats. IF so, why do scientists from all over the world agree with the concept? Why do countries that are not at all approving of Democrats or their liberal ideology also on board with it? Why would China, India or Iran do anything just because politicians in the US thought it up? Why do ALL of our allies look at the evidence and say "yup, that's a real thing"? Why did Exxon predict global climate change back in the 70's?     Climate Deniers come in a bunch of ideologies. Identifying which they believe and using the concepts innate to those ideas to explain the costs or dangers of Climate Change is about the only way to move forward. And.... it often fails. Climate Denial is not a scientific disagreement, even though commonly framed as such. It's almost always political or just a "all my friends say it's fake" and changing someone's politics is like changing their identity... only possible with great effort, great friendship and genuine listening.

I think for many people though they aren't even necessarily aware of the kind of language that is being used because to them it's just so natural to think that kind of stuff. This isn't because it is somehow human nature to think such but that they have probably experienced this kind of dehumanizing language for other groups that their country or government or the West in general doesn't like and so when it's time to support a genocide of certain marginalized groups it's just one more step on the path they are already taken. It's not this huge leap.  We see this kind of dehumanizing language when it comes to other countries such as China, Africa and other such things.  This is also true for Muslims in general as well as the dehumanization of Muslims also helps contribute to this.  All of this basically boils down to the acceptance that their country is the holder of the monopoly of righteousness and that they are the ones that get to decide which places or people or countries or whatever are of the most righteous and those who have been given the title of such is a society that is worthy of our pity and our resources and our sorrows and tears.

I don't think this is really the mode of thought institutionalist thinkers have. They specifically reject the idea that there is some destiny toward liberalism, they instead regard it as a fragile kind of saddle-point between anarchy and dictatorship that is kind of contingent on unlikely coincidences in history and can easily be lost if the balance tilts too far into either the direction of the state or of civil society. This is what Acemoglu calls "the Narrow Corridor".  Personally, I think we can make this kind of argument, and say that countries like South Africa should cherish and protect the democratic institutions they have, in hopes of realizing long-term dividends as people adapt to living in a democratic society and raise their expectations for a responsive state. This is more of the perspective of someone like Fukuyama, though.  EDIT: I think it's helpful to to remember that from the perspective of Acemoglu, civil society *is a threat to liberal institutions*, just as the state is. He will point to things like religious fundamentalist movements in the US as examples of civil society trying to pull power from the state to try to move the US into the mode of an "absent leviathan". From the institutionalist perspective, "shackled leviathans" exist at a delicate balance of conflicting forces, neither which would want a shackled leviathan left to their own devices, but both who would prefer it to the alternative that the other side wants.  Looking at things from this perspective, In South Africa, we can use your examples as places where the "shackled leviathan" does mediate, as it is supposed to, in disputes between state and civil society, and then suggest this as evidence that South Africa is on track toward development. We could also point to examples like Winnie Madizeka Mandela's extrajudicial killings of the ANC's opponents or Zuma's ability to start widespread rioting in Kwa-Zulu Natal as evidence that non-state institutions are winning out over state ones, and then say that South Africa is moving toward an "absent leviathan" model. This would look at two opposing arguments from the same framing, I think.

Im also wondering what you make of the argument that different ethnic and religious communities in the region got on well before the Zionist movement caused distrust between the non-Jewish communities and the Jewish ones.  Ive heard this kind of thing a few times.  What did the Jewish communities that were already in the region (I think theyre called the Mizrahi) think of the early Zionist movement?  When people make this argument, I think theyre talking about when the region was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.  Im not sure if that environment could have been re-created after WWI though.

He's got some very hard-line, borderline insane people and some relatively centrist / right-of-center folks, and if he loses a single coalition member, he's out of office and likely headed to jail on the corruption charges). 2. **Huge US pressure**. The US *deeply* does not want to see a protracted Israeli occupation of Gaza, and Biden is particularly politically motivated to pull off a diplomatic coup right now. If the US can pressure its allies into it, it would like to see Egypt open up to evacuate civilians and a Saudi-led coalition actually installed to police Gaza after Hamas is ousted. A bloody invasion into an area civilians have no escape from, followed by the prospect of a neverending Israeli occupation, all in the lead up to an election? Not great. 3. **Israel doesn't know what it's going to do after removing Hamas**. This is sort of an alternative to "internal political dissent"; the basic fact is, Israel doesn't really have a "day after" plan and once the fighting ends that'll become very evident. Hamas isn't going anywhere; if Israel is wise, it's working as hard as the US on a diplomatic solution (not with Hamas, with the US/EU/Saudis, etc).

You're right, the source I learned vietnam war history from used Viet Minh to refer to the forces of the north throughout the war, but they did technically change their name to the People's Army of Vietnam before the Americans came into. However they are the same thing. The Viet Minh soldier I mentioned referred to force he was a member of as the Viet Minh, not with its official name.  > It doesn't mean that they were defeated by the Viet Cong aka guys in tunnels.  I mean they weren't in the sense that they never lost a battle to them (unless you count the early days of the Tet offensive when they took a bunch of cities before the counterattack), but since the US lost the war by just deciding it wasn't worth it anymore there is no real smoking gun as to who won the war. Personally, I think the guerrilla fighters who made life hell for the Marines had much more to do with it than the regular army that got smashed in some early set-piece battles and then remained mostly inactive for the rest of the war. Obviously PAVN contributed to the war, especially where it spilled out into the rest of indochina, but I think the Viet Cong were ultimately more impactful.  > The point is North Vietnam had far more resources than Hamas. It isn't a useful comparison at all.  I definitely agree there, I was just objecting to the idea that the Viet Cong did not win the war for the Vietnamese.

The Viet Cong couldn't have done it without support from the regular army.

Annual supply growth of solar and wind is 5 EJ, rising to around 16 EJ by 2030; annual total energy demand growth will struggle to rise much above 6 EJ this decade before falling back in the next decade.  Unfortunately carbon emissions didn't peak yet, as gas burning was substituted by coal burning again, as far, as I understand it. But if we indeed saw the peak for fossil fuel demand back in 2019, that would be a positive milestone, I think. Is this a premature hope?

World's population is poised to grow, but mostly in places like India and Africa. Many of these regions are already desperately poor and now look into fossil fuels to grow their fortunes, just like the West has done. While it is magnanimous to say that nothing needs doing, and the problem takes care of itself, and all we have to do is uplift women, etc. I wonder if we have the time to do that.  it should be clear that we're already in resource crunch. World is facing the situation where population keeps growing, especially in the poorest regions of the world, while resources to be shared between all people is already shrinking. Peak oil is likely behind us, and fossil fuel peak in general can't be many years behind because oil is such a large fraction of it. With looming loss of 80 % of our energy basis, we probably lose transport, manufacturing, chemical fertilizers, etc. as we scale back the human enterprise. Loss of climate conditions for reliable food production and the ability to ferry grain all across the globe likely creates starvation conditions in many regions of the world, and I think it is cruel to birth more people into this world.

For example:  &#x200B; >every indicator we have is that AI will eventually be capable of pretty much magic at SOME point, it's more of a question of WHEN than IF  There's really no factual basis for that claim.  We have plenty of indicators that it may never become that capable.  In fact, most evidence points towards the fact that we will never create sentient or super-intelligent AI.  The last four decades or so are littered with expectations of god like AI within just a few years, and the last few years of a few narrow areas with big gains is quite an anomaly.  That could change, and things could continue to rapidly speed along, but if you think we're already at the point where the majority of indicators is pointing towards magic rather inevitably, I think you're focusing too much on the shiny new show off aspects recently in the news and not evaluating all the data carefully enough.  >computers are almost as good at coding as we are today  I've been programming quite complex open world multiplayer streaming video games engines, tools, and pipelines for over two decades, and based on the coding I've seen done by AI so far, it is still very far away in skill, knowledge, understanding, and robustness on that front.  AI can write some rudimentary code, which achieves a narrowly stated simple goal, but the resulting code is objectively quite bad code in almost every respect, and it cannot yet remotely write anything valid towards even a junior programmer level goal.  >it can pass the BAR exam  Perhaps it's gone farther since then, but last I had checked in on that aspect, it had only passed one portion of the written part of the exam, which isn't exactly that surprising given what this is and what the training data set was.  Any form of regurgitation of existing text within a very well structured context the latest AI does have fairly well in hand.  On a related note, it's also well known for effectively lying and making up whatever data is required to back up some point it's trying to make.  That's not very promising overall for its ability to effectively rationalize about the real world, as it's much more focused on making up things than the truth, and that may be a rather fundamental hurdle it will need to overcome to allow it to effect any of its potential grand plans in the physical world.  Now, that said, in general I do share some major concerns regarding AI, mainly due to the potential for exponential scaling in a very compressed time frame.  The main problem there is that by the time it's starting to become a serious and imminent danger, we likely won't have time to notice and react.  Also, I would not expect any super-intelligence to care about humanity in the ways that would be necessary for it to solve climate change for us.  It's much more likely it would take a larger view of things, wiping out humanity for the sake of the rest of the species that we are actively exterminating along with ourselves.  That's assuming it's even benevolent at all, which is also less likely than it following some other goal, such as growth and survival for itself at all costs, etc.

I generally considered myself fine up until I had my son. He really fucked me up in ways I couldn't imagine.

Since day one I've had worries about preschool etc even though I know he's WA more likely to be abused by a close family member or similar.  We basically started with "Stopp! Min kropp!" ("Respect!

In those younger years it's basically mostly telling the child everything you're going to do, like for instance if you're gonna wipe their face you tell them "I'm gonna wipe your face now" and if they disagree you can stop what you're doing, it teaches a child to both be comfortable saying "no" and knowing they have some decision rights. It also creates the habit that if someone just does something, it's weird/off meaning they should tell us. Then as the kid grows it goes into private parts and who's allowed to touch them etc.  It's been good I think, we had to inform his preschool about us doing this way so they could help reinforce the habit of always telling him what would happen.

I do it a few times a year, but its not so much something I feel like I have to do.  However, I do really enjoy going to theme parks, including traveling to do so. Thats not something Id be willing to give up, as its become my main hobby over the last two years. Theme parks have similar issues with food waste, power use, land use, large parking lots, relative lack of transit access (except maybe Universal Studios Hollywood located directly above a subway station), etc. to large sports events. Its not an apples to apples comparison, but it would sort of be hypocritical for me to say that sports events should be banned and then proceed to go to a theme park on a weekly basis.  So Id say let people enjoy what they want to, and venues like sports events and amusement parks should take steps to becoming more sustainable. For example, reducing/eliminating fireworks shows, having more plant based food options, having eco friendly packaging, installing solar panels on large show buildings (where indoor theme park rides/shows are housed) or stadium roofs, installing wastewater collection systems, using relatively empty parking lots as park & ride shuttle locations around the city so people dont drive all the way to the event (a major concert venue in my city does this and its 100x better than their expensive and traffic-jammed parking on site), etc.

The 14th Amendment reads:  > No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.  Trumps arguments are twofold: - That the President is not enumerated here, nor the President an officer. - That the Presidents oath of office doesnt include the word support, but rather preserve, protect, and defend.  These fail the Originalist test in so many ways.   On the officer part, the Office of the President is referred to throughout the original constitution.  And he is Commander in Chief of the military, which is either a military or civil office, if not both.  Originalists also look to contemporary writings of the time things were written.  When the 14A was written, there was literally debate on whether to enumerate the Presidency.  They chose not to because it was so obvious he was an officer that it didnt bear repeating.  Originalists would respect that.    They would also respect that preserve, protect, and defend and support are not different things.  In fact the Presidents oath is an even higher standard of support.   Originalists dont argue that the Air Force is unconstitutional because the text only mentions the Army and Navy. Nor would they argue that freedom of speech only applies to speaking, and not writing or other forms of expression.  Remember that this courts originalists said that baking a cake (or refusing to) was both free speech and free exercise of religion. Even as I hated that case and its outcome, I cant argue that the justices were acting in bad faith.   Even a Textualist, who might ignore the contemporary writings on why the Presidency was left out of the 14A, would be expected to recognize the plain meaning of office and oath, especially relative to other references in the text.  A Textualist also wouldnt oppose the Air Force, because they would recognize the plain meaning behind the text (allow the federal government to maintain a military).    Theres a great example of this from Antonin Scalia.  A person was caught buying drugs and trying to barter by trading a gun for drugs. He got a harsher sentence because the law had additional penalties for using a firearm during a drug trafficking crime.  Scalia argued, rightfully, that no reasonable person could think using a firearm meant anything other than using it for violence.   Even the Heller case on gun rights, which hyper-analyzed what was little more than an extra comma in the 2nd Amendment, was still Textualist.   What Trumps lawyers are arguing is Strict Constructionism, or that the law only applies to what is literally written.  These are the same people who argue there is no Separation of Church and State because those words arent literally in the 1A.    Pretty much nobody respects Strict Constructionism as a form of legal interpretation   And even if you won on that argument, which has such massive implications that I doubt this or any court wants to touch it with a 10 foot pole, conservative justices usually give deference to problems Congress can solve. The 14A says that Congress can remove the bar from holding office.  The court doesnt need to remove the disability because Congress can just do it if they want.

Traditionalists Catholics at the time was still quite skeptical of it, & Integralists were actively opposed to it. It was only by the Second Vatican Council that the Church officially endorsed liberal rights, as they correlated with the now developed doctrine of Catholic social teaching. It was this doctrine that inspired Distributism (& even CD in continental Europe alongside Neo-Calvinist theology), beginning with Pope Leo XIIIs encyclical Rerum Novarum. Then he was succeeded by Pope Pius X, who was much more traditionalistic, & even helped to inspire Integralism with his encyclicals. It was by the post-WWII era that CST was more fully developed, with Pope John XXIII, Pope John Paul II, & even now, Pope Francis.

Imo I had no idea about any of that till recently. However, I have seem multiple compilation videos of him kissing and ESPECIALLY OF HIM GROPING girls at events. Many of the girls seemed to be between preteen to like 14/15 years old.  Not just like smelling their hair, but literally moving his hands over the sides of their body, back, and even breasts. This was at multiple events, I saw some where he was giving these girls awards and literally running his hands up and down their backs, then moving his hands to their breasts. The girls looked so uncomfortable, there were some that physically tried to move forward from him or away from him, he would grab them and pull them back to him, in a few he would pull the girls back so they were up against his front body, it looks like he is literally pressing his crotch into their backs. In some videos he us rubbing his crotch against them and also moving them against his body.  I don't know about tge child he is kidding though. He has been known to kiss children, I saw videos only with babies and toddlers though.

We have great difficulty seeing beyond the parameters we were given as almost all information that we take is meant to distract or inhibit us from whatever "natural" programming would take place.

Some take that a step further and say the outer world derives from the inner world in a real, physical way. Both of these views are dangerous.

One theory is that is provides the means to make things make "sense" in a dream-like state in which we are constantly in, so therefore have little to no idea what it would be like to think outside of it.  The basic principle, on a neurological level, for psychedelics is that they overall 'smooth out' activation potential in the brain, by increasing it in places where it is less and decreasing it in places where it is greater. I think that this is a bit of a blank slate effect, where you have the sudden capacity to rewire your brain. You are making it more plastic. I'm not a neuroscientist or anything, but that's what I've gleaned from research on the topic.  So anyways, it's logical that the brain would have an internal mechanism to do the same. But like they say, the dose makes the poison. There is a substantial difference between a microdose and a macrodose. The latter is what we more typically recognize as "drug".

Did you know that Battlestar Galactica was written by Mormons and Kobol is based on the Mormon star of Kolob which is said to sit nearest the throne of God. Spoiler: Kolob/Kobol is Sirius, the cosmic axis mundi, the 'glory in the centre' according to Albert Pike. As the glory in the centre, Sirius also tops the central pillar of Wisdom on the first degree masonic tracing board depicting Solomon's Temple. In masonic parlance it is called the Blazing Star. Mormons believe that the illuminating light of Sirius can unearth the Pearl of Great Price.  Also, I can't get over the fact that the black monolith (of wisdom) erected during Coronavirus was in the Mormon state of Utah. The black monolith has implications for the rebuilding of the temple of man as we see in 2001: A Space Oddyssey and with the Hilton Hotel that stood opposite the temple of Solom...sorry I mean the World Trade Centre. As the masonic first degree tracing board and Kubricks film show, this also firmly connects to Sirius, everything does, but you'd have to check out my posts for that.

The short answer is yes, meteorologists are still able to forecast regardless of climate change.  Weather forecasts consider current atmospheric conditions to predict what will happen next. The models are an incredibly valuable tool, but we also use satellite, radar, MOS data, weather station data, and information collected from weather balloons to determine what the weather will be like in a few hours, tomorrow, a few days, and next week.    Climate change, while very real and deeply alarming, isn't necessarily preventing meteorologists from figuring out what the atmosphere is going to do. For example, climate change is causing hurricanes to slow in speed, which is increasing the flooding associated with these storms. A forecaster (as well as models) will still base their prediction off the current trends of the atmosphere and the observed behavior and data collected from that particular storm.   E: clarity

As an individual, there are two major ways you can affect change: 1) as a consumer, refuse to buy their products or only buy as much of them as absolutely necessary, 2) and this one is more important, join forces with other like-minded people and vote, protest, unionize etc. with the issue of climate change among your top concerns.

Right away, it switched sides, as we can see from the fact that they pushed for the removal and extermination of Indians. Also, their opposition was the Whig party, which was against the Indian Removal Act and vowed to protect minorities against mob rule. Because the sides were switched, the vast majority of Whig party were anti-slavery.  (Eventually, there was rift in the party over the issue of slavery, and anti-slavery members of the Whig party, including Abraham Lincoln, exited the party and formed the Republican Party. As we can see, the parties must have switched again because it's common knowledge that Republicans are actually the racist ones.)  Then the parties switched when the Democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all Democrats owned slaves, but 100% of slaves were owned by Democrats. Not a single Republican in history owned a slave. As we know, the parties switched again when Republicans repudiated slavery and Democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.  Then the parties switched again when a Democrat assassinated Republican Lincoln.  After the Civil War, the parties switched again during the Reconstruction Era, when Republicans attempted to pass a series of civil rights amendments in the late 1800s that would grant citizenship for freedmen. As evidence of the switch, the Democrats voted against giving former slaves citizenship, but the civil rights amendments passed anyway.  The parties switched again when the Democratic Party members founded the KKK as their military arm. Democrats then attempted to pass the first gun control law in order to keep blacks from having guns and retaliating against their former owners. A county wanted to make it illegal to possess firearms, unless you were on a horse. (Hmmm wonder who rode around on horses terrorizing people ). Gun control has always been a noble cause touted by Democrats, but the racist reasons why the concept of gun control was dreamed up was a part of a party mentality switch, but not the actual party.  Somewhere around this time former slaves fought for gun rights for all, and the NRA was formed. The NRA switched parties too when they defended the right for blacks to arm themselves and white NRA members protected blacks from racist attackers.  The parties switched again when Republicans fought to desegregate schools and allow black children to attend school with white children, which Democrats fought fiercely against.  The nation saw a rash of black lynchings and bombings of black churches by the Democrats in the KKK and the parties switched again when Democrat Bull Conner tried to avoid prosecuting the racist bombers to get them off the hook. When blacks protested this injustice, the party-switched Democrat Bull Conner sicced dogs and turned the hose on them. He also gave police stand down orders when the KKK forewarned attacks on the freedom riders, who had switched parties.  The parties switched again when a Democratic Party president appointed the first and only KKK member to the Supreme Court.  The parties switched yet again when Democratic president FDR put Asians in racist internment camps.  Then parties switched again when the Democrats filibustered the passing of the second set of civil rights laws giving equal protection to minorities.  The parties switched when a Democrat assassinated MLK.  This brings us to modern times. The parties continue to switch all the time.  The parties switched when Democrats proposed racist policies like affirmative action to limit opportunities for certain racial groups in order to grant privilege to other racial groups.  The parties switched when the Islamic fundamentalist Omar Mateen and several other ISIS mass shooters aligned themselves with Democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.  The parties switched again when liberal student groups in schools like UCLA and Berkeley call for segregated housing to make "separate but equal" housing quarters for black students. Actually this is a current ongoing thing, so the parties are right now in the middle of switching on this topic.  Parties always switched currently now that Democrats are rioting and violently protesting democracy.  The parties switched once more when the Democratic Nominee for President, an old white man, said "you're not black" if you don't vote for him, in a moment of clarity of how the Democratic Party sees their largest voter base: as property belonging to them.  So as you can see, because of Party switching, Democrats were always the ones who stood up against racism and wanted peace and unity while Republicans were always the racist and violent ones calling for division and discord.

It'd be rather difficult to have any industry to show them as the sanctions bite.  I think muslim countries like money enough to not force that issue, but I doubt it would get to that point.

Israel has some gas production sure, but that's both offshore (very easy to disrupt) and in Gazan waters if Gaza were to be recognized. Meaning it'd be contested/fought over/disrupted.  >If by limited economy you mean pre-industrial economy dependent on rather hostile neighbors for sustenance like Gaza is, then yes.  I meant limited economy in the way that sanctions would force them to scale back to some degree, although it would be hard to estimate.  >Yes, and I am saying that we are approaching the generations where we have little reason to bother remaining as Israel's shield.  I disagree with that. The US has been consistently loyal when there has been little reason to be, so it will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future. I can see the US reducing, or even eliminating, aid but I can't see the relationship failing altogether. It probably has to do with the way our election officials are chosen, though.  >And then decades of retracting. Or years, depending on how severe the sanctions are.  Israel will likely have expanded their population and solidified their territorial expansion enough that they wouldn't retract much, if at all. Plus, there will also likely be more conflicts that is used as an excuse to expand. The media was so focused on Oct 7th that they mostly glossed over the intensification by Israeli settlers.

This info is well known and readily available.  The current glaciation cycle is caused by cyclic variations in the Earth's axial tilt and orbit. These are regular and predictable. The last glacial period peaked around 22,000 years ago, at which point more sunlight began to reach the Earth's poles, leading to rapid melting (and less ice means lowering Earth's albedo which causes a feedback loop that encourages more melting) until it reached a stable point at roughly our current climate about 14,000 years ago, alongside a 4-6C temperature increase which has since remained very stable.  In that stability, all of human civilization has occurred. Unaffected by human activity, this period would be expected to last roughly another 50,000 years, at which point the changes to our tilt and orbit would enable ice to rapidly form again.  An important thing to note here is that that rapid melting and temperature increase occurred over *thousands of years*. The earth warmed at less than 1C/millennia during the last warming period.  Earth is currently warming at a rate of 0.2C/decade, or over 20x faster than the last warming period. Even if it *were* natural (and it very demonstrably isn't) that would still be incredibly bad!

Or any type of air.  Its absolutely ridiculous to even entertain that explanation, which explains **NOTHING** about the process of money creation(ie. monetizing our production, or, tokenizing our wealth)   Society horizontally polices itself with the "thin air money"(or money is created "from nothing") nonsense.  **Over 55 years ago now, the true principles of economy were established, yet monetary solution has to compete with peoples ego and false perceptions. A promissory obligation is how genuine money is created.**  Promissory obligations = Registered, recorded, enforceable contracts **backed by (representing) our labor and production.**  Thin air = thin air These are not the same thing ????  "Effectively then, a promissory obligation is necessarily a contract to deliver so much production of an obligor, receiving so much property from a creditor the latter of whom is truly a creditor so long as they hold the promissory obligation, only because they have given up commensurable property in return for an enforceable obligation to deliver commensurable payment."https://holland4mpe.wordpress.com/2014/03/17/saving-the-eu-and-monetary-union-itself/  "The inherent fault in todays (lie of)"economy" is that the "banking" system claims the value of our debts to each other on any sale/trade/transaction, as a debt subject to "interest", "owed" to themselves." David Ardron      "If money is introduced to circulation as debt subject to interest, then merely to maintain a vital circulation, we have to perpetually re-borrow whatever we pay against principal and interest obligations. Payments against the previous sum of principal thus are re-assumed as new principal, equal to the old  making it impossible to pay down the sum of debt. But as payments against interest obligations do not count against the previous principal, our perpetual re-borrowing of interest to replenish a circulation means therefore that the sum of debt will perpetually increase so much as periodic interest on an ever greater sum of debt.  Not only would this mean that there is ever less of a given circulation to devote to prices, much less increasing prices ostensibly tolerated by the non-existent (circulatory)inflation, it would mean that**as a consequence of this multiplication of debt in proportion to the circulation, that the system inherently, ultimately collapses under a sum of debt it can no longer afford to service.**  So we have several things here  not just some purported (circulatory)inflation, which we dont know even can exist:  **We have an inherently, irreversibly multiplying sum of debt, which ultimately engenders collapse, and which, all along the irreversible path to that collapse, imposes ever greater costs of servicing ever greater debt.**  While I can understand that these costs manifest in ever greater prices as industry has to account for their erosion of profit margins, it is also true that ever less of the circulation can be devoted to commerce, as ever more of the circulation is inherently devoted instead to servicing debt.Eventually, even ALL of the circulation is devoted to servicing debt.  **So it would not be an increase in circulation per goods and services which engenders perpetually increasing prices; it would be the nature of the money; it would be that all the money is subject to interest which inherently engenders perpetually increasing prices by imposing ever greater debt upon the people.**  And so in fact, while industry can survive this irreversible multiplication of debt, it would be **the ever greater costs of servicing this inherently ever escalating multiplication of debt which actually even requires prices to inherently increase at an equivalent, ever greater rate."Mike Montagne**

Hard to install, hard to modulate, and we could still end up with a greenhouse (imagine: less insolation, higher CO2 levels, just the same heating rate but now less food grown)  b) Increase the reflectivity of the EarthAs per (a), but closer to home.

And everything else is a tweak to the heat-capturing aspects of the biosphere. One would need to not just reduce GHGs, but would have to actively sequester them to below pre-industrial levels. Even then, the heat is still present in the troposphere and the oceans - and that's going to leave just as slowly as it arrived.  Short of magic, we're on course for a few degrees over pre-industrial levels in the forseeable future (50 to 100 years).

I dont ripped any system or state what I wanted as far as representation of one area vs the other. Its simply a matter of history:  In the 20s the cities were growing. The census was on its way, and Congress knew the urban areas had grown significantly (as is typical during economic strains). They didnt want the change in the EC that would have certainly have happened due to the significant swing of urban vs rural populations, so they passed the 1929 Act capping the House.  Cali is a horrible example (which makes it the best as well) for your premise b/c the rural vote is already a lost one.  The EC doesnt protect against that. It protects an entire rural state from being subjugated by a majority urban one.  because we are a Republic of States. I know that bow that is being taken as anti democracy and thats simply not true. What people fail to recognize is that a CONSTITUTIONAL Democracy, so a democracy with established guidance with defined inalienable rights, is NOT one of majority rule. Hence the tyranny of the majority. Many, in not every, modern democracy recognizes this and has patterned themselves after ours.  Our fallacy has been the growth in power of the federal government, specifically the executive and the bureaucracy (alphabet departments). The executive branch was never meant to be a policy maker. Thats the LEGISLATIVES job.  So, back to how its the representation thats the problem and not the EC. The EC only exists to facilitate the national election of our executor: the individual charged with EXECUTING policy. Not making it. The EC was established to give a fair and balanced voice to the individual STATES of our republic in that election.  I want ALL VOICES to be heard. Effectively. That will never be through one individual for the nation. It can only be better heard through more direct representation.

If I were consulting a campaign I might suggest that rather than doing five passes of high propensity voters it would be better to do three or four passes and then one or two passes of the lower or medium propensity voters especially at least a week out. Also when crafting targets voting history needs to play a larger role than they currently do.

They would have been good news in 1982, but in 2022, it's an admission that they aren't really going to do anything.  In order to avoid +2, we would need to reduce emissions by 90% in ten years, which would mean a decrease in emissions of over 9%, per year, every year, starting in 2023.  But I guarantee you that we will emit more in 2023 than 2022.  I'd bet any money that emissions in 2032 will be higher than they are in 2022.  ----  You go to the doctor with stage 4 cancer, and you get an aspirin.  You want to thank them.

For those that have everything figured out and nothing goes wrong, well clearly the post doesn't apply to them then.   Applying for assistance removes the negative factor in absurdity of price, especially those wanting to study or work in another state for higher median income.

Who knows how things like mass die offs of plant life and animal life affect the carbon cycle. Particularly bad years of forest fires. Methane release in the shallows and wetlands of the far north and south. These are wildcards and they are game changing.  There's more to the climate than raw emissions. The entire Earth system and all life in it is under assault right now. I wouldn't put 8.5 out of the question just yet. Also geo-engineering probably could impact things and bring the numbers down but it is an artificial reprieve that will require constant maintenance. And once we stop the upkeep the heat will come back with a vengeance so long as the carbon and other GHGs remain in the atmosphere. No easy way to remove any of that stuff if we arent willing to allow forests to grow back over the next few hundred years... more to a forest than just trees too, takes a healthy and diverse ecosystem to make and maintain a forest  As the climate breaks down we will have the tackle the true root cause of our issues... temperature relief will not relieve us of the problem of overshoot and biosphere collapse. Nor will it solve pollution.  In either case 75 years is a long ways away and we will have a better idea of where it is all going as the cracks form.

Democrats control the house so they could give Ice and CBP the resources but they won't so option 1 is out. They can't drive all the immigrants to the border and kick them out because they would just have to catch them again and there are likely real asylum seekers among the economic migrants and they deserve a chance so option 2 is out. They can't just let them go because they illegally entered the United States and there are likely criminals, terrorists or other dangerous people hidden among the groups and they need to be found. So option 3 is out.   The Democrat solution seems to be call Trump a Nazi and evoke holocaust imagery. It's a simple fix, give them the money to improve conditions and expedite processing but I don't the Democratics want to fix this. I think they want to keep this going until the election. Congress has to power to fix this but they seem to be unwilling to.   No one should live in shitty conditions like that but you just can't let them go either so the only solution is build more detention centers and hire more staff for quicker processing.

Contrast this with Israel who holds regular elections to decide their govarnment officials, and the fact that in pretty much all of those elections, Netanyahu keeps winning and getting reelected to govarn israel.    many in there views sees that as Israel casting its decision on who should represent them.  personally while i dont agree with it, the logic is sound. since many consider democracy and the ability to hold elections as the voice of the people being heard, and able to decide who should represent them.  think about for example North korea, North Koreans havnt held any elections, would it be reasonable to say the north korean govarnment represents all north korean people? or would you say its unfair to state they represent all north koreans when they arent allowed to choose their leader?  in the end many view it that Palestinians voices are being stifled from choosing their leaders, whereas israel is free to choose theirs.  thats my input and a explanation, i know many on this subreddit like to claim and hold the belief that its all just double standards because the pro palestinians "want to kill all the jews and destroy israel" even tho thats so far from the truth.    sorry to say but the situation and stances are alot more nuanced then many want to believe for the sake of conveniance.   just as i know pro israels support israel occupation because they believe it makes israel safer, not because it fun to do or hate palestinians.  theres beauty in nuance.

Nuclear plants are huge capital investments that look like a boondoggle for a decade, then look like a poor investment for a decade, then get ignored for two decades while continuing to provide massive, clean, low-cost power, then finally they get additional funding to keep them alive for a couple decades longer (mostly to avoid the boondoggle impression that a new project would bring)  I'm all in favour of building lots more nuclear, but coverage of them tends to be sadly one-sided, leading to poor public support.

But not to my knowledge no. But its a poor analogy.   When police are responding to a school shooting they arent operating in hostile territory where the entire populace is a potential threat. There would be very little danger in approaching the school, or leaving the school. This is not the case of the IDF operating within Gaza.  Also the situations arent remotely comparable. If theres a shooter who has the potential to kill 10 people inside the building with them then it would make no sense to kill everyone yourself. Israels main responsibility is protecting other Israelis. 100% I would want any armed forces to minimise civilian casualties as much as possible. But if Hamas are deliberately operating out of civilian infrastructure, under international law, they are legitimate targets. I personally would want my government to prioritise my life and the lives of my fellow countrymen over the lives of another countries.

Thank you very much for your work on this. Its a long read but I really hope others take the time to check it out.   Something that jumped out at me was the dates and how they align with Rep. Mike Turners (chairman of House Intelligence panel) announcement of a serious national security threat on 2/14.   He didnt initially say, nuclear threat, that was later added by other news sources and repeated by other government officials.  His statement said that the US,    has identified an urgent matter with regard to a destabilizing foreign military capability that should be known by all congressional policymakers.    There is a lot more that goes into it but what really stood out to me was the fact that a guy in this position would make a comment about something the average American  has no control over and really, isnt all that new. Russia has been working on ways to destroy satellites for a while.   Instead, an issue like the one being experienced now is much more likely to concern/imminently impact the typical American. I know that personally I take about 2500$ worth of meds a month (if not covered, in part, by insurance). Fortunately, I wont die without my meds if I have to skip them for a while.    But, what about those who will die (or be seriously impacted) without their meds or medical procedures if they cant afford them?  That to me sounds like a much more pressing, serious national threat than more Russian weapons.   By shifting focus from the computer issue, the government and large corporations have time to work on the issue and weave whatever stories they need in order to avoid insurance/legal penalties.

(while colonists get subsidies) the prosecution is built into the law for israeli arabs. i guess the arabs dont have to join the military so thats a plus. 3) technically correct, these people are still controlled, because of the giant walls all around their cities and a trade blockade that has tremendously messed up their economy. unemployment is over 50% and their main export, olives mostly got burned down. Israel because of their position of power and their control over them, might as well own them. the idf come and go as they please into Bethlehem and cut off their water routinely for 3 days (even before the war). the Palestinians decided to keep 3 days worth of water in tanks on top of their houses and so the new routine is to shoot holes in them right before cutting off the water. this is just one example of many 4) new boarders have been established in the past and those palestinians mostly just get displaced and crammed into smaller palestinian territories. its why areas of palestine are the third most densely populated areas in the world.

Islam related killings are nothing in comparison.  So obviously your take is only because you were not intelligent enough to discern propaganda from reality. Or are just another racist who thinks the US/Israel killing millions upon millions collectively is just "foreign policy", but ISIS killing a few thousand is some huge problem (ignoring that ISIS was propped up by the US).  No, the cancer is US empire, israel, and their actions, which have led to human suffering all over the world, since the US empire uses israel to do its dirty work in Africa, Latin America, not just the middle east.  Further evidence of your delusion is that you state this during an active genocide where israeli soldiers are bragging about killing women and children openly, yet still think Islam is the cancer.

The issue relates to thermodynamics: how can we create an energy source as energy dense as gasoline or coal. Batteries currently can only store 1/10-1/5 the energy per kilo as compared to fossil fuels. This limits the viability of electric planes, cars, generators, and industrial equipment. IE a significant contribution to human carbon emissions. Find a safe better battery; create a high range low weight vehicle/ generator. Right now thats not practical on a large scale (given lithium reserves and the safety of lithium ion batteries). Carbon capture technology is also not practical yet (it needs to absorb a significant fraction of the carbon to stop or reverse climate change). Other than liquifying carbon dioxide and pumping it in old oil wells, there are no practical long lasting ways to sequester carbon (even planting trees is useless as they die and release the carbon in like 2-3 decades). This is coming from an electrical engineer who has been tasked to exactly solve these issues, it would have not been solved in 2001 or now. Climate change is not going to be reversed or stopped for a least 50 years at this pace if not longer. Buying an electric car right now also isnt a solution to climate change because a large amount of our power comes from fossil fuels, and being entirely dependent on green energy has its own issues (famously the duck curve). There is no magical solution for this disaster, it will take more engineers, thats why this guy is dumb he should be building something to solve this not crying to the media.

They have convictions just as strong as we do.  They are just disenfranchised because there are only two parties.  The most common true swing voter is the character voter.

This gives use immense and extraordinary leverage, to *force* an unconditional ceasefire, and even a two state solution with 1948 borders, if it so wanted.  Also, you have it backwards about Hamas. Hamas is the symptom, not the main cause. Its the symptom born out of military occupation, blockade, apartheid, military courts, extrajudicial killings and detainments, rationing of water and electricity, and oppression. 30,000 dead - 10,000 of which children - with an **atrocious** 2:1 civilian:combatant casualty ratio overall, is a testament to that. If you dont treat those main causes, but only focus on Hamas, its all in vain because another organisation will replace Hamas. Just how Hamas replaced Fatah. Just how Fatah replaced [], and so on and so on.  The solution is a free, fully sovereign Palestine with 1948 borders. This is what would make the symptoms (like Hamas) disappear.

Looking back, that was quite an example of statesmanship to end it once SCOTUS ruled.  The sad thing with your last assertion is that our system works quite oppositely.

The big point of it is  Hamas has suspended all Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations until humanitarian aid is brought into the northern part of the Strip.  For those who dont understand it. The north of Gaza is where IDF began to move out and now conducts raids and bombings by drones with little boots on the ground and Hamas began to send their people there to take control over/get things going.  Their ultimatum is that more aid must reach north. Not all of Gaza. Since aid is still being delivered there. They specifically talk about north.  Meaning. There are weapons and money in the aid they are going to give to people there to do stuff for them.  No wonder IDF rejected it. No sane military would agree to it. It would be like giving your enemy gun to shoot at you. Time to pull the sleeves up and move to Rafah. If they stopped negotiations it means hostages are either dead or they have gotten leaders out of Gaza, maybe also bunch of money, weapons and promises for their Iranian and Russian overlords. Hit them hard, hit them fast, leave nothing to be buried.

The right of return to Israel is based primarily on  ethno-religious connection, right? you don't need a parent or a grandparent, even a great grandparent. it's about continuing a connection to Judaism. that's very different to having a current and traceable connection to it.

They ask Trump and his acolytes as if there is a chance he would ever accept the results. He lost every lawsuit related to 2020, tried to do a coup and failed, faced no consequences, and has never admitted it. Refusing to accept 2020 is a requirement for any R that wants to be in maga orbit.  In 2016 he said then as well that he would only lose if the election is rigged.  Point is that the media asks this question as if they dont know the answer and clutch their pearls when he does what everyone knew he would do.  The norms are gone, and they act like the game hasnt become a full out war.

Or repeated disinformation that fraudulent bankruptcies were costing Americans hundreds of dollars a year in order to make declaring bankruptcy harder.   Or used a nation hurting from 9/11 to finally invade another country with similar skin colors as the ones actually harboring the terrorists that did the attack.   Or used disinformation to pretend that public insurance was unaffordable and the only moderate way to fight inflation was higher interest rates.    There are a lot of times that ugly populism takes the form of radical capitalism. And unfortunately that seems to be what we are getting now.   Here's to hoping Dems take back a trifecta in 2024 or else we get zero years of progress, 4 years of Republican legislative policies, and then likely a major Republican majority after another typical loss for the presidential party in the midterms.  Of course no president has regained a trifecta after losing it in the last 75 years. But I'm sure Biden's got the chops for that...

My proposed federal law delegates the decision to the states, but Congress could decide otherwise: that it is up to the Federal Elections part of executive branch to decide prior to election, or it could be decided as part of the legislature rejecting electors after the election. The point is that SCOTUS would want Congress to specify the process since thats Congress job.  Yes, the eligibility question would remain outstanding until Congress acts. And the current SCOTUS would be happy to see Trump win election without blood on their hands of deciding whether he was eligible or not.

Simple truth is Republicans don't want to do anything and allow Democrats to do what ever they want. Republicans are weak and feckless, they are RINOS, Republican In Name Only. The movement of Americans wanting their rights and values represented is a long time coming, After bush if was realized that "Fly Over Country" is not represented or even cared about. CA, NY, FL, NJ, etc all have the highest political weight in our system... So Trump came in and changed that, and now the movement of America First is growing stronger and the politicians that actually care about these people's values and way of life are speaking up and getting rid of these RINOs one primary at a time.

Bill Clinton earned the nickname Slick Willie and won two terms in the White House. Trump went from being emphatically supportive of abortion rights to telling voters he alone was responsible for the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v.

The percentage in the past has been as much as 28% I believe but theyre getting better apparently. Its allegedly 18-20% this go around.   Its really hard to know while theres so much activity but as Richard Kemp has literally told Obama in the past: IDF is incredibly solid with their accuracy and technique. They have to be because as you can probably tell right now, they are criticized for literally every single detail (down to being accused of being [Islamophobic](http://www.classicalmusicguide.com/viewtopic.php?t=20101) for not raping Palestinian women.) their accuracy so far has been a display of technology in our day in age: http://www.classicalmusicguide.com/viewtopic.php?t=20101 someone posted that theyve gotten the most citations of any other country from the UN in the last few years by like.. dozens. Im not surprised. UN is not their friend.   Keep in mind too that Hamas won the [election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Palestinian_legislative_election) but the other parties havent broken up, theyve just latched on so PFLP and PIJ are in there too. There could be one Im not sure of. Fatah members they pushed off the roof after elections were over, probably because the race was too close. (Theres speculations as to whether they skimmed off some voters to win but no one really knows.) so for instance, PFLP is supposedly who has the Bibas kids yet the terriers who surrendered said they lost touch with leadership too so .. my best guess is that the actual day of theyd been more organized than anyone ever expected from them but either they didnt have this length of time organized out of expectation itd be over (they thought Hezbollah and some Israeli Arabs would be joining in but apparently not  at least right now? They could always change their minds- looks like the houthis pissed off Japan atm) so Id say expect a lot of confusion moving forward. There were something like 30 ceasefire violations during the temp because guys just come out from wherever they were and think its still wartime.   By the way, thank you, I feel so smart now  the only reason I can keep up like this is because Ive known the right things to look for from experience and I look at past events for evaluation. Like the idea of flooding the tunnels already happened 9 years ago so the headlines about what it will do to Gazas soil is just a distraction. How about the fact that Jabalya  is a sinkhole now because the tunnels are not properly structural!?

The GOP recognized this, and decided that if they want to stay in power, it would be easy to just back Trump to try and win over the base he appeals to.

You do realize how narcissistic it is to presume yourself an accurate judge or even gatekeeper to just how principled someone is allowed to be before "responsibly" conceding to party lines? I *strongly believe* that such qualification of patriotism isn't just coincidentally aligned with your individual politics. In fact, to question others with yourself as the reference point is a subversion of democracy if you only seek to minimize their voice rather then educate them. And saying "we already tried that" or "they won't listen" is exactly the sort of pretext people use to seize power, no matter how well intentioned.

I see subjugation in quotes. To be clear, I believe this is what it is and I think from an Israeli policy point of view it makes sense and a strategic way for Israel to use Israels power- I think the challenge is that Palestinians havent given up, Palestinians have a wide degree of attention from the world, Israel wants to be a western-style democracy, and often times in situations like this the population would have been already expelled/ethnically cleansed in the territory Israel/a state wants to control, and the time frame for wide scale ethnic cleansing has passed without Israel losing its main ally.

Tying it to Reagan and Clinton is a mistake. Also, jobs in defense industry are more likely to be union jobs b/c of preferences in government contracting, so cutting one of the biggest sectors of union employment would work against your stated goal. https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/23/385843576/50-years-of-shrinking-union-membership-in-one-map  The other thing is about 1/4 of the national defense budget (2nd largest category in the budget) is spent on personnel, so cuts generally mean getting rid of personnel, which cuts people out of a lot of benefits like money for college, GI Bill provisions for housing, and small business grants. The biggest category is operations and maintenance, at about 38%, which involves a lot of contractors. These are people in good jobs that have good benefits. https://www.pgpf.org/budget-basics/budget-explainer-national-defense  This stuff is complicated  and we think of DoD as just blowing money on lots of expensive planes that don't work well, but really it's mostly blowing money on direct or indirect labor costs, about 60% of it's budget.

Hamas, on the other hand, doesn't even try to obfuscate their war crimes. Almost everything they do is a war crime and they couldn't care less about it.

For most people here, this conflict isn't personal. It's not about preferring Jews to arabs. (Israel has a large arab minority and the vast majority of Israel supporters have no problem with Israeli arabs.) For most people, this conflict is about preferring democracy toislamist regimes.  >Only one side is making any progress at wiping out the other, and that is unambiguously Israel.  One side (Hamas) is failing to make progress towards destroying Israel. The other side (Israel) has made progress in destroying Hamas, but has no interest in destroying Palestinians or arabs.  >There was no danger after 8th Oct to Israelis.  Are you serious? Hamas has been firing rockets at Israel since they took power. Leaving Hamas to grow in strength would objectively allow them to become a serious threat. I assume you're American. Israel is smaller than New Jersey. Look at New Jersey on a national map. Now imagine Hamas controls a territory the size of Seattle on the border of New Jersey. Now imagine New Jersey is also surrounded by enemies to the North. You're telling me that there's no threat here? This isn't even mentioning the fact that after an attack like 7 October, Israel has to respond or it will project weakness to its enemkes and invite stronger attacks.  >The root cause is the brutal oppression Israel has inflicted in the region for decades.  Maybe we should ask why this conflict is where it is. Why has Hamas been under a military blockade since the Second Intifada? Why has Israel not been able to find peace with Palestinians when it's clearly been trying to make peace with other groups in the region? Why aren't the West Bank and Gaza controlled by Jordan and Egypt? Why wasn't there a Palestinian state in 1947? Why do Israelis seem obsessed with security?

You, and many others, promote "capitalism" in the sense of markets freed from the control of oligarchs, saying "look at how well this would achieve the goals we set it", then pull a bait-and-switch (whether you're aware of it or not) for the capitalism that exists in reality&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;in social democracies, barely chained to serve its citizens, and ever eager to slip its leash. The explicit point you're willing to make is the motte, easy to defend: "markets can be used to optimise things". The bailey that you retreat from when called out on it, is "the system we have is perfectly fine but for a few small tweaks, nothing needs to fundamentally change and in fact, any changes touching its roots would harmful." Arguments against it can be dismissed as semantics. (Perhaps, to you, it is. Perhaps the broader argument you made was mad without even realising it. Even so.)  Capitalism is used here as a thought terminating clich. "Look at everything that a market does! Isn't it great! Well, we have markets at home." "A neural network! AI! Terrific!" And what a wonderful AI it is.  Tangent here, I do notice that you want to earmark carbon tax revenue for CDR. Preferring it over abatement is perfectly sensible. Maybe you're even aware of how much of a rort your average carbon credit is. But ultimately it's insufficient as is targets only one symptom, not the cause.  Fundamentally, the accumulation of capital in a few private hands, and their dictatorial control over their small fiefdoms of the economy is anything but decentralised. It is the very opposite. Even then, it may still be the best mesa-optimiser there is, who knows. I'm not an AI engineer, maybe we can just add more layers. But you're taking a look at this clearly misaligned optimiser, and saying "hmm, let's just fine this paperclip maximiser some paperclips every time it ate a person". Well. Maybe it'll stop eating people. Problem solved right? Wouldn't want to have a shortage of paperclips.

But because people are so averse to voting in local elections that left the door open for Biden to actually do more fracking after being elected. Which Biden did, gladly.  The crux of my argument is that if you dont vote in both local and state elections consistently and purposefully you should really, REALLY start talking less when it comes to climate change.  People getting distracted patting themselves on the back for 4 years straight while the person they voted in does the opposite of what the people wanted make me upset.

The tropics (where I live), are already very hot places and climate change makes them hotter. It's like saying turning the knob on a 15 degree stove to 30 degrees is more impactful than turning the knob on a 40 degree stove to 50,   What is a bigger change, from -1 C to 1C or from 10C-30C?  My analogy is much more accurate than your. For various reasons.  1. ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION. The Northern most you go, the more warming. It is not flat. The Arctic, the epicenter of the Northern Climate is warming at 4 times the speed of the tropics.  So using your numbers, for every degree change in the tropics we add 4 in the Arctic. If the high temperature is increased by 10 degrees, then the low temperature increases by 20, so your in your example of the stove would be 15 degrees to 45 degrees  increase in low for a 40-50 increase in high.  2. There are KEY TEMPERATURES:  Some are obvios like 0 C, the freezing point of water, some less so, like 37 C the temperature of the human body. Departure from those temperature often means changes at a much larger scale than other temperatures. For example changing the water from 0 C to 1 C is an extremely larger change than  changing water from 1C to 2C. 37 C for the human body temperature is a bit more flexible if the body drops below that or above it for long, there is also a state change that is much larger than the one implied by temperatures.  Both examples, water temperature and human temperature are relevant to this conversation.  The Arctic sea ice is defined by its temperature. The changes that an ice free arctic will have in our climate system, are literally indescribable by modern science. And that is happening very soon.  Humans have a habitable range temperature range. That range is extended by things like conditioning, and adaptation. people in the tropics are well adapted to hot temperatures. I do not want to be anywhere near the NH when it is summer and there is no ice in the arctic to melt. Only sunrays falling on water warming it up. And then then the  Arctic winter comes, and that ice is frozen and that humidity extracted from the air and launched at the hemisphere.... ouch.  Nah. There is absolutely no way you have thought this through.  >I can describe it to you in the aspect of the Earth, but I cannot with respect to human civilization. It's nota foreign world, it has occured in the past, however, at current rates, it hasn't happened, and I'm not a research fellow in this field, so I cannot tell you exact details.  It has not occurred in the past of human civilization! Human "civilization" started 10,000 years ago in a **climatic stable** time called the Holocene.   Science is not sure but chances are that 130,000 years ago, during a small time period called the Eemian there was no ice in the arctic.    130,000 years ago. and it took thousands of years for the ice to disappear, not decades, like it is happening this time.   I'm sorry about this, but you  are well informed in misinformation. We are heading towards unparalleled disaster. World ending disaster. But even saying this makes me sound mad, even though  I speak with evidence.  And that is the real problem. The reason medical science has placebos and double blind experiments.

And unfortunate events like the Deir Yassin massacres are bound to happen. I dont condone this, but you have to ask what preceded these actions by the Jewish militia groups, and that would be the continued Arab pogroms against the Jewish population prior. The Jews have had enough of being victims of persecutions, leading to these militia groups from being formed. The Jewish violence was in response to Arab violence.  And it still doesnt even come close to Arab genocide like you claim. These are the Arab population in Mandatory Palestine (excluding Tran-Jordan):  1922: 585,000  1931: 769,600  1945: 1,056,000  1950: 1,015,200  https://preview.redd.it/khgrsu6mjn9c1.jpeg?width=985&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e4d2556c2b6e2069f70815d86241c102da1a4e5  Doesnt sound like a genocide of Arabs to me.  And if a 2 state solution in 1948 was a bad idea, what wouldve been a good idea? Im guessing you hold the position it shouldve been a single Arab state. I have the following points against that:  1. Firstly what would you even name this piece of land? Palestine? Palestine itself is a Jewish reference. It should be named something else. 2. The Jews faced persecution all over the world, and also at the hands of the Arabs in Mandatory Palestine. Should the Jews live in fear for the rest of their lives for as long as they live in this new Arab state? 3. Why do the Arabs deserve a separate state any more than the Jews? There was never a sovereign Arab state in the region, other than a Jewish state. There was never a distinct Arab nation in this land, other than the Jewish nation. Most of these Arabs by the year 1948 were also very recent immigrants from neighbouring Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. What claim do these people have to this land any more than the Jews? Why is it only the Jews that dont deserve a state of their own? If not Israel, where do the Jews belong? Jews have as part of their prayer for Passover, next year in Jerusalem. Every place in Israel has Jewish artefacts and Jewish references. Jerusalem remains the holy site for Jews, long before for Muslims. Why should the Jews not have a claim to statehood also?  None of this is meant to deny the rights of the Arabs. And for what its worth, Im all for a secular one state too. And Israel is a secular state, its Jewish in name only. Muslims, Christians, Druze, atheists and everyone else has equal rights and freedom to its Jewish citizens. I doubt any of this would be possible with an Arab state, just look at the rest of the Middle East.  But why are you trying to deny the rights of the Jews and rewrite history?

Well, perhaps not throwing out. For example, wood and plant fiber based boats could still allow long-distance trade and travel along coasts, up/down rivers, and even cross-oceanic voyages (though they would take weeks instead of hours). We could still have primitive engines made with steel (Since steel lasts thousands of years, and we've already created so much we shouldn't have an issue with supply if used only for actually essential stuff) powered by bio-energy, combined with wind (we've used modern physics to really improve sail-power).   Air travel is a rough one. I don't see a way to do any scalable air travel sustainably. Perhaps there could be some for emergency long-distance flights using condensed ethanol or methane. Passenger air travel likely wouldn't be an option; but long-distance ships could replace it as long as we don't have such a time-sensitive capitalistic work culture.   Cars (or at least, wheeled carts with some form of powered engine) could certainly be doable. You can run a car on wood, or ethanol, or other options. The biggest issue isn't necessarily an engine-powered cart, it's the road infrastructure that's required to travel long distances. These roads are rather destructive and require large amounts of labor to build and maintain. Perhaps a few main arteries to provide travel from major city to major city in motor-cart caravans, and roads made of cut stone blocks (ala the Romans) instead of garbage concrete or asphalt. I could see some rentable "cars" in centralized lots in cities that one could use to travel to other cities within a few hundred km; but personally owned vehicles would be unlikely to be a thing outside of whatever form of the "elite" existed in this culture.   Internet and phone infrastructure could be doable, but not in the "Every house has a connection" way. Again, main infrastructure connections in major city-to-city corridors (copper and steel last thousands of years, so using such material for electrical and internet cables could be doable with currently available materials without further mining). I could see centralized "internet cafe" style buildings in the city center one can go to communicate with friends and family in other cities if they were in their cooresponding "internet cafe" at the same time (or sending e-mails or the equivalent, for non-synchronous communication.   > reverting to the post modern dark ages and eventually repeating the same mistakes all over again?

Otherwise, the lack of surface deposits of oil, gas, and most metals means that making the same mistakes all over again is highly implausible. Once the industrial machine has wound-down (one way or another), starting it up again at-scale is unlikely to function. Sure, there are places with remaining near-surface deposits of coal that could build *some* form of industrialized sectors, but mostly the surface-deposits have been stripped as the low-hanging fruit over the past few hundred years.

To the extent there are analogies in caselaw, they're in the landmark Equal Protection cases, and, given *Dobbs*, the current Supreme Court has already clearly demonstrated it will not use the Equal Protection Clause to block any limitation on abortion rights.  > Reiterating hospital and medical staff obligations to maintain patient privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, investigating when there is evidence that patient privacy has been breached, and pursuing appropriate legal remedies against violators; and   HIPAA has exceptions for reporting information to law enforcement, including when state law requires the provider turn over information pertaining to a crime. This ordinarily comes up in cases like mandatory reporting of evidence of child abuse or gunshot wounds, but laws mandating reporting of suspected illegal abortion would fall under the same exceptions.  > Enforcing Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits discrimination in health care on the basis of sex, including on the basis of pregnancy, against federally-funded health care entities whose personnel improperly report to law enforcement when patients miscarry, terminate a pregnancy, or seek other pregnancy-related care.  Section 1557 of the ACA is a general non-discrimination provision which, to my knowledge, has never been construed to prohibit disclosure of medical information to law enforcement when that disclosure is mandated under state law.  So, as usual when dealing with Congress demanding the administration do things that it should be doing itself: what exactly do they want him to do? Under existing law, as the Supreme Court has interpreted it, the feds have no authority to intervene in these cases.

The president isn't an autocrat or dictator; he has to comport with existing law. If Congress wants more, Congress needs to be doing it itself. That they don't have the ability to force something through Congress does not mean they should be whining that the administration isn't breaking the law by not doing what they want.

As Pohl et al. allude to, it's not a satisfactory explanation by itself for how we could transition into a snowball Earthyou need something to change, and while a stable climate in a Faint Sun scenario may have high CO2, you need one of them to change to cause snowball Earth, and the Sun takes far too long compared to the geological history of the Ordovician glaciation.  They say:  > Fainter Sun (Gough, 1981) somewhat reduces this apparent discrepancy between high CO2 levels and glacial inception by suggesting that the solar constant was lower in the past. Nevertheless, it seems insufficient; the best hypotheses today consider a Late Ordovician drop in CO2 to be the trigger of glaciation (Brenchley et al., 1994; Kump et al., 1999; Villas et al., 2002; Lenton et al., 2012).  [This paper, Bahcall et al. 2001](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0010346.pdf), suggests that around when the Ordovician was (some ~ 450 MYA), solar luminosity (energy emitted per unit time) was roughly 4% lower than today (their Table 2).  That translates to some 54 W/m^2 less sunlight at the top of our atmosphere, which is very substantial.  (In terms of radiative forcing, average energy per unit area onto the planet's surface, you divide by 4because only a quarter of the Earth's surface ever faces the Sunand multiply by 1 - A, where A is the albedo; so it may be something like 8-11 W/m^(2) radiative forcing.  Contrast this to an estimated 3.7 W/m^(2) radiative forcing change per doubling of CO2.)  It's so large in fact that [some research has been done to solve the apparent "Faint Sun" paradox](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2011RG000375), where the Sun is so weak in the far past, according to standard stellar evolution models, that very strong greenhouse effects are needed to explain why there was even liquid water for such an extended period of time.

Yes, there was a paper/study, suggesting that the PETM happened within 13 years, although I think it was disproven/highly unexplainable, even when it comes to methane hydrates(correct me here, if I am wrong). I know that not every scientist has these worries, but taking a review from Peter carter, we might be adding 3-4 ppm of CO2 per year into the atmosphere. Going hypothetical here, we would add 400 ppm to ppm to our current CO2 concentration(415ppm, If I am sure), so that's 815 ppm. That doesn't even consider feedbacks and so on. Only within a hundred years. Then, consider past climate: Creatacous was 8C warmer then today, at 800-1,200 ppm or even more, as certain sources claim. Keeping that in mind, we should worry about the rate of change. If we jump to 1,000 ppm within 200 years(slightly more), then there is little to no evidence of such a thing happening in earths past. How life will react and respond is even more uncertain in some cases(of course, decline and rise in certain phytoplankton populations is somewhat of an indicator, as well as forest fires and other causes like behaviour change).

You'll see that not only the Arctic circle, but also everything closest to Antarctica (i.e. the southern half of South America, southern Australia, and even some coasts of Africa) as well as most of Europe, most of China and all of Japan will never hit even *one* month of such temperatures even then.

Historically, there have been undeniable cases where Jewish people were targeted and harmed or killed just for being Jewish; bad actors used that fear to insist that a country for Jews wasn't enough, they had to have a country where *only* Jews were allowed because any other group would eventually turn on them. That was used to justify atrocities toward the Palestinians, and then when the Palestinians resisted, they were able to go "see? we were right! they're attacking us!"   As an example of manipulation-by-fear you can see for yourself: in America, there are "two" political parties. Each maintains control of around a third of the population primarily through demonization of its enemies. The Democrats, for instance, are relying almost entirely on fear of what the Republicans would do if they get control of the government back instead of actually trying to win anyone's votes. Even when Biden is openly supporting genocide, people will argue that we have to vote for him because it would somehow be worse if it was Trump supporting the genocide. And Republicans do the same thing; most non-wealthy Republicans aren't really dumb enough to think the Republicans are actually helping them, they just have to protect their values against their enemies in the culture war.  This demonization of your enemies eventually leads to brutality, atrocity, and genocide, as we're seeing right now. A really illuminating take on this is the HBO Films movie *Conspiracy*, which is about the Wannsee Conference where the Nazis laid out the plans for their final solution. It's a bunch of men sitting around a table and discussing genocide like it's some kind of pain-in-the-ass public works problem to solve. Since they've stopped thinking of their enemies as human beings, it's all down to the logistics of what to do with them, how to eliminate them in the most efficient manner. I'd always recommended it as a stark reminder of just how far away we really weren't from that happening again; but then we can see it happening again in Gaza right now.  As for how people maintain hope... they just have stronger spirits than we do, because I don't see it either. I can't see any circumstance where this gets better before it gets so, so much worse. At this point I'm just hoping for literally anything to shake things up, because if we play out the status quo we know where it's going to end up.

A bottle of ketchup isn't $5 because of Ukraine and will not get cheaper if all aid is cut off.  Russia winning is also only inevitable if assholes like the GOP cut off aid for years at a time and morons like Biden, Scholz, Macron etc half-ass their support. EU+NATO+other allies can easily.  American government also has issues, like neo nazism in the government. BTW Right Sector, Azovt etc only had a few seats at most and lost them ages ago.  If anyone is using them they aren't arguing in good faith.

Of course deaths from nukes are 'clumpy' - they tend to arrive in large numbers once every decade. If the next nuclear disaster is like Fukushima in terms of numbers, then the percentage would double.  (I also note that the report counts deaths during construction in looking at solar and wind, but ignores those for nukes)  The other metric is cost. The fukushima disaster has so far cost $82 billion, while chernobyl has cost around $68 billion. The primary costs of burning coal are health related - air pollution from coal plants are estimated to be equivalent to a reduction of life expectancy of around 4 months for everyone.   [This](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00080-0) puts a year of life expectancy for everyone as worth $38,000 billion - so 4 months would be $12,667 billion.  So in terms of cash - nuclear disasters are 1.2% of the cost of coal related deaths, but generate 28% of electricity compared to coal   (https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix)  So the health costs of nukes is lower than coal, by a factor of 24 - not the 82 that it shows if you only look at nominal deaths.  It is very much which stats you choose to look at.

From Michael Gorman - "It has often been said that the most common idols in the West are Power, Sex, and Money; with this I am not in any profound disagreement. However, inasmuch as these idols are connected to a larger vision of life, such as the American dream, or the inalienable rights of free people, they become part of a nations civil religion. I would contend, in fact, that the most alluring and dangerous deity in the United States is the omnipresent, syncretistic god of nationalism mixed with Christianity lite: religious beliefs, language, and practices that are superficially Christian but infused with national myths and habits. Sadly, most of this civil religions practitioners belong to Christian churches, which is precisely why Revelation is addressed to the seven churches (not to Babylon), to all Christians tempted by the civil cult.  What I think is important to notice is this: we're used to living under the assumption that, in spite of our disagreements, we all fundamentally valued Democracy, the will of the people, and every citizen's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, even if we disagreed vehemently on how to go about it (or who deserved it, or whether it was successful, etc.). It was a foundational element of our society that maintained stability through a common faith in the country.  **That assumption is dead.** It hit me when I thought to myself, "How could anyone look at Putin's Russia and think that it's a good model, like my Republican friends have been telling me lately? There are so many people oppressed at the expense of the few. It's a broadly unsuccessful society except for the kleptocrats on the upper echelon." Then it hit me - they *want* a society like Russia's, just so long as they believe that they'll be the ones at the top. They don't care whether the people they don't like are disenfranchised or killed/imprisoned for free speech or exiled or stolen from or stepped on. Just so long as they believe that their way of life will be the privileged one, they're fully ok with it coming at the expense of the "lesser." That's absolutely bone-dry fundamental conservatism, and it's indistinguishable from fascism.

Communism and socialism are private property hierarchies that have centralized authority who dictates resource availability. If you look at the map in the article, the places contributing the least to climate change are the places that have still have indigenous egalitarian tribal influences, like Kenya and Peru. The communism or socialism Vs capitalism starts the clock during the last 10,000 years, but that is all after private property hierarchies conquered most of the world. We lived for hundred of thousand of years before that. \[[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hunter-Gatherers\_and\_Play](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hunter-Gatherers_and_Play)\] One of the biggest distinctions between egalitarian vs delayed return, is justifying relative poverty. Egalitarians often worked 20 hours a week, where as private property hierarchies have a subset of indentured people who often work 16 hours a day, so an elite few can concentrate wealth. We are still in the habit of justifying the top 10% concentrating resources, while the lower 60% live in desperation and squalor. The myth that we can grow every one out of poverty just using capitalism, with out addressing the just world hypothesis built around having an indentured subset of people, is part of what I'm trying to address.

This is NOT the methodology AOAV used to calculate harm in Iraq or Syria.  From AOAV's article. You are comparing apples to oranges.  Here is AOAV's methodology:  >>The data below is based on captured reliable English-language media reports (BBC, CNN etc.) by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV). It is solely an analysis of airstrikes where casualties (killed or injured) were reported and recorded (non-injurious air strikes are not captured). The nature of conflict means that as the scale of conflict grows, less injurious strikes may not go reported by English language media, meaning only the most catastrophic events get captured. The data is not intended to capture all harm and is not indicative of total numbers killed or injured. All air strikes recorded within the time frame are listed, but some air strikes only harmed armed actors. These are not included in the civilian harm analysis. In Mosul, Aleppo and Raqqa, we took the most injurious month to civilians from airstrikes to compare to what was happening in Gaza in October 2023.  >>Of note, only aboutone third of all incidentsin Gaza are currently being individually captured by English language media, with most news sites reporting on cumulative data from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. AOAV cannot capture such collective figures as it would go against our Monitors methodology, so we just record each isolated injurious incidents that the media reports upon.

I don't think it's useful to discuss whether the IDF is guilty when discussing if Hamas is guilty or vice versa.   > The 40 beheaded babies is what sent a shiver down my spine, turned out to be untrue.   I watched, just after it was broadcast, the original reporter from which this claim was made. What she literally said online was  > _100 people killed, 40 of them children or babies with some of those beheaded_   The 40 beheaded was never made by any official or even journalistic Israeli source involved in the reporting. In particular, the IDF *never* made it or confirmed it. There was *one* Israeli journalist who made the claim and there were *some* international places it was repeated.   Yet this is one of the two claims that I _always_ hear from those on the Palestinan side, repeated along with some weak denial such as "the IDF has denied having made this claim ; the IDF said they have no evidence of that" and so on.   I also followed that *really* carefully. The beheaded babies *as stated by the original journalist* has been confirmed. If you do not believe me then the original photos, including some distributed by Hamas themselves are on https://www.hamas-massacre.net/ and https://www.hamas.com/ and this has been backed up both by eye witnesses, autopsies and later statements by the IDF. There are apparently now captured Go Pro recordings which are not being released but which the UN could check if they wished to.   So what do we see:  * Fog of war causes mistakes in repetition - visibly not deliberate misinformation  * Palestine supporters are getting news from a sources which end up misleading them * The IDF was extremely honest, even when a story comes out that might be in their benefit, they deny knowledge of it until they are sure.  * There was a  * In the end, Hamas war crimes are true and are fully verifiable. There's no doubt almost all of what was claimed happened and those spreading denials are clearly dishonest.   My conclusion on this is interesting. I am convinced that Palestinians, even Hamas, are being used by Russia as a distraction. I'm absolutely convinced that Hamas's war is totally against the interests of Gazans and is being fueled by media misinformation. I watch media sources on both sides of the divide. Obviously I only *know* that things are misinformation sometimes. I see many more of those situations on the Palestinian side. I'd suspect that you are mainly in that pro-Palestinian media space and will find it really difficult to get true information.

Hamas using human shields is not a valid reason to simply obliterate the entirety of Gaza including those human shields.  The civilian casualties in Gaza are *well* beyond what anyone could even begin to argue is "necessary."  This also doesn't address the fact that Israel has used the Gaza genocide as cover to ramp up their violence and land grabs in the West Bank, where Hamas doesn't even hold any power.  This *isn't* complicated. Israel is in the wrong. The Hamas attack on Oct 7th was it's own atrocity, but it *does not* justify Israel in the mass slaughter of people in Gaza in the pursuit of revenge, and it doesn't entitle Israeli settlers to steal yet more land in West Bank.

The way it works is by minimising the potential profit that you offer others. The idea is that if your opponents cant win, you cant lose!  With all the bankers and big businesses gradually using this strategy more and more, the potential profit available in trade is constantly shrinking faster and faster. Society has had to make great strides in its search for potential profit over the last 70 years, since this strategy was discovered. Weve also had to use all the potential profit locked in earths resources.   All together, this has caused all the major problems society has seen since the industrial revolution. All modern wars, poverty, climate change, etc, would have all been avoided if the potential profit from trade wasnt constantly being sucked dry.  There is one alternative strategy they could use instead. We call it exploitative. Exploiting makes more profit whilst offering more potential profit to others. We naturally strategise using exploitative strategies. Its better in every way, but, cognitive dissonance is caused by the unconscious conflicting with trusted strategies. GTO is an extremely trustworthy strategy, and so causes this issue VERY badly! In short, you cant stop people using GTO. If you try, they go mental.  I was quickly cancelled in my field, and have had to resort to sending crazy sounding posts on Reddit to raise awareness about this problem.   There are solutions.

I misworded my point. The argument I was pushing for is as following: Palestinians do not hate Israel because it's a Jewish state, they hate it because it is colonial in its foundation.   Palestinian society is colonial in its own foundation, Specifically under the Ottomans, the area was first mostly depopulated with the population mostly settled in the big cities, many Arab villages were erected directly under them in the hundred-two hundred years prior; immigration in and out of the region was ample on both sides, hundreds and even thousands of Arab families were literally imported under order of the Ottomans in the centuries before 1917. A thousand years of favoriting Arabs and Muslims over other ethnicities and people have made Arabs blind to their own colonialism. If colonialism is bad, its always bad whether done by Arabs or Jews; if it isnt then its just hypocritical to vilify Israel for it.  Colonialism is also a historians fallacy, its just the buzzword the narrative caught on to in the seventies (can anyone say USSR?). Colonialism isnt the reason they fought Israelis in 1920, it was genocidal hate of those not Arab deciding theyre allowed to buy land despite Arab wishes.  >Palestinians would generally not mind a  state housing Jews, zionists, Muslims, Christians, etc... if they were guaranteed access to their ancestral homes, full rights, and ample representation in government.  Now, seventy five years after their initial loss in a nationalist confrontation you claim they would accept a state which they rejected multiple times in the decades preceding that loss, a conclusion which polling emphatically contradicts regardless of its validity.  From our side, Israelis wont accept that not because were racist Judeo-supremacists, but because weve been at war for a hundred years explicitly because Palestinians found our presence intolerable, and to now declare we can share a country that wont devolve into civil war due to extremists on both sides is pure fantasy, its saddening but its true.  >5-that's unfortunate but likely. the claim still stands tho. It's either war or this.  Or a capitulation to Israeli demands. I know thats viewed as completely taboo by Palestinian society for your own reasons, but Japan is a good example of a cooperative occupied people achieving a genuinely thriving society and country.

This is the same curve that ends at 6C on the 2100 horizon.  granted, we have no clue how the experiment will change between then and now, but it is rising at an accelerating pace.  likewise with sea level (the least of our problems.)  https://imgur.com/a/bgKwRlV  Besides being relatively self-evident, I thought I would add the above link, which is to a recent communication letter from James Hansen.  It demonstrates the acceleration of global temperatures quite well and puts it into context of the lag between CO2 rise and global temperature increase.  James Hansen has argued that the CO2 in the atmosphere already is compatible with a +3.5C temperature rise.

So sort of, yes. And at the same time I feel we need a high-touch/people who are in-touch with their likely audiences kind of job plus those who can dedicate their time to figuring out what issues the public already quickly relates with and how those things can relate to cohesive climate action or at least environmental justice and literacy.  If you're thinking an AI tool like chat gpt or copy.ai, it can certainly help spur some better self awareness and reflection especially if it was like a browser plugin and also provided fact checking and references to studies and common arguments/counterarguments ( so far the best website I've seen for this is https://skepticalscience.com/ but a lot of it really gets into the weeds of technical academic jargon as a way to counter what are usually actually emotional appeals and sentiments).  And so having tools to help translate between allied audiences will certainly help though I'd encourage us to also have something that can help people strategically navigate media and amplify messaging too.  But I think what I hear you're proposing is the equivalent of having spell check or grammerly available for climate issues. Meanwhile the other side has lobbyists, PR firms, and full time news agencies devoted to their cause and messaging already captive audiences who are familiar with their own messaging and narratives on anything from the cost of inflation, why people can't get a job(because environmental regulations are frequently scapegoated as the cause for job losses and economic woes), and what the fossil fuel industry has done for their children's local sports club and education.   Like there are literally entire cities, county governments and even states which are deeply captured by the fossil fuel industry (Pennsylvania, West Virginia in the US are both gripped with industry billboards talking about how wind and solar don't keep the lights on at night/when the wind stops, and there are even education departments and educational publishers for the public schools that forbid the teaching of climate science).  So we need some institutional level organizations and media that really uplift relatable stories and bridge them with sound science in ways that the public can understand and care about sooner.  We also need jobs and career and political roles that not just reward but actually depend on and prioritize scientific competence as the default rather than making it a nice to have feature that gets referenced on the occasional basis of political convenience.

You can view our climate action platform [here](https://www.commongoodparty.com.au/climate). Our current program is sparse and mostly based on using market mechanisms. These two particular policies will have a massive effect though;  >A moratorium on new coal mines and gas fracking.    An end to subsidies for the fossil fuel industry.  My opinion is that we should have a base plan of using market mechanisms to change, with the goal of adding on further Government intervention. This means, for our party, a Carbon tax is a minimum, but we will need to eye further stuff such as bans on carbon intensive production and the like.  Also, our policy on make a just transition is merely this;  >Assistance to workers in the coal and gas industries so that they can re-train and relocate.   Our consultation with people from those communities suggests workers do not want transition at all. Arguably the left wing party lost an election because of that in 2019. I feel there needs to be more to help those workers, but I don't know what. I'm thinking community run transition programs? Something that gives these workers a powerful voice in enabling a just transition.    TBH I don't know much about "Fit for 55". From what I've looked up it seems to be a compromise between the Great Reset program (read: Eco Capitalism) and the Green new deal. Do you lean towards either of those two programs?

It is most likely the case with Mr. Johnson that because of his religious dogma, he chooses to suppress what he considers to be "sinful" homosexual urges or feelings.   The decision to not act on homosexual urges & live as a straight man is the "Godly" thing to do.   Thus, acting on or supressing homosexual tendencies is a choice that a person can & must make.   Johnson is also a religious fanatic. It's clearly his main motivator. And Johnson thinks that everyone should live & believe as he does. Under that mindset, Johnson's beliefs & choices have made him a righteous person who can go out & proselytize about homosexuality. Or push for policy alongside awful groups like the ADF.   The Christian Nationalists like Mike Johnson want to tear down the wall separating church & state. They believe they have a mandate (called the 7 Mountain Mandate) which symbolizes  the seven areas of US society that they plan to exert their influence & beliefs upon: family, religion, education, media, entertainment, business, and government.  Worse is that some of these Christian Nationalists think that Trump is a vessel sent by God to help them achieve their mandated take over & save the US from ruin or rapturous demise.

Nuclear is in my opinion one of our biggest options for sustainable energy. Many of the Gen IV reactors like the TRISO fuel reactors Im working with have passive or even inherent safety, meaning that even if there was an earthquake the fuel still couldnt go critical. Other reactor designs like the molten salt reactors also have greatly increased safety built into their designs compared with the Fukushima and Chernobyl reactors, which were operating with equipment that relied heavily on equipment reliability/redundancy and human interaction in order to operate. Many new designs also are modular meaning smaller reactors can be deployed to remote towns where there may not be a well-developed power grid. I would say the biggest informed objection that can reasonably be made against investing heavily in nuclear would be against the nuclear waste they generate, however I would say the pros far outweigh the cons.

To decide that the fight for environmental protection is the place to insert ones opinions about economic systems is not only not helpful its derailing. It comes across as disingenuous to me that the writer of this piece sees the free market as the roadblock to true environmental focus. If this where the case then the argument to make is not that capitalism is bad. There are numerous points on the road to now in which big business has removed the freedoms from the market we exist in currently. Corrupting influence from the market to the government makes this opinion surface deep at best and denies all the positive influences private institutions have had (all be that influence restricted by government). This doesnt make the free market bad, it makes the current market corrupt and in need of true reform. Without big business buying control of markets and destroying any true contenders for that market through governmental power (bought and paid for) we would see actual competition. There is no competition without a marketplace and there is no marketplace when big government is bought and paid for by big business. This isnt the end result of free market, this is the result of corruption.      Confronting capitalism will not change anything, confronting the corruption that has removed the free market will.

They need Palestinian refugees to exist. If Palestinians got their state, there would be no more "refugees," and the business and flow of aid money ends. It's in their best interests to perpetuate the conflict and leave Palestinian statehood up in the air. UNRWA schools literally taught a whole generation of Gazans to hate their neighbors and make unrealistic demands so that the core issue of sovereignty is never addressed.

Me and my family or someone I don't even know but hates me it's an easy choice and it'll be an easy choice for you.  Again. Doesn't mean I'm happy.  And leveling neighbourhoods actually has a reason for it. When the ground forces get into the city it would be very bad if terrorists suddenly ambush them from buildings that still stand or that tanks can't get in because of the buildings.  300,000 Palestinians remained in northern gaza even after Israel did everything it could to evacuate them. Israel can't not bomb rocket launchers just because civilians are near it. It runs the risk of rockets hitting Israel and it makes the iron dome bleed money.  That's why so many people died and why it's also why fewer people die every day. Israel doesn't aim for civilians.

Your right that it can be used if its part of a fossil fuel or nuclear grid. But If your refrigerator turns off at night that isn't useful. If that happens medicine and food spoils and millions die at minimum. If we can't rely on our lights to turn on at night what's the point? If hospitals lose power because the winds are blowing in the right places or the sun goes down plenty of patients will die. If you can't heat your home in the winter at night so many people will die mostly children and the elderly. We can't exist without reliable power and I haven't even mentioned the industrial processes. To sum it up without reliable power we wouldn't be where we are and roughly half the world population would be dead at minimum and everyone would be far poorer.

Either is okay though, I mean have at it, friend.   Your general beef though seems to be that fossil fuels will be continue to be used until theyre no longer economically viable. Well yes; decades of global and national institutional and diplomatic effort has been spent precisely on making them unviable through carbon prices and taxes; and now more than a trillion dollars a year are being invested in renewables. Which is both a consequence and a further driver of fossil fuel unviability. This year global investment in solar alone will exceed global upstream investments in oil. 10 years ago, solar was 1/20th the size. The tipping points are here.   If you think these are lies which support the status quo youre mistaken, theyre neither lies nor defence of the fossil fuel addicted world.  The truth of the economic realities of the clean energy transition *is* driving a transformation in global geopolitics.

You continue to argue things that are outlandish without any evidence. Israel IS being called out and arguably unfairly and disproportionately. You sound like you don't understand war situations or ethics at all, so let me spill it out for you. Not a single country can judge Israel for any of the palestinian deaths, they all CREATED the terms that permit Israel to bomb any military targets when said target is purposefully hiding behind civilians. You cannot ever reward bodyshields or hostage situations, and moral decrees directly put the deaths of Palestinians onto Hamas. Palestinians have stayed where they are and either supported Hamas or they did nothing to fight Hamas, which could have easily changed their deaths. Hamas represent Palestine as a country whether you believe it or not, and inside this situation they are chanting to call for a palestinian state. Well how can they have their own state without a government? Hamas is their government... Either way, palestinian people have numerous innocents dying, but Israel is morally allowed and arguably required to strike indescriminately.  You are more morally at blame for the death of Palestinians then Israel. Social media and other countries attacking Israel for "civilian casualties" is essentially spoon-feeding Hamas encouragement to use them as shields even more because it's working. Hamas knows they will not win, they are just trying to capture the weak minds in the US. The majority of Palestinians blame hamas more than Israel, as Hamas has them held at gunpoint by any new reporters in the area.  Israel can be held accountable for unreasonable and unethical actions. But in this case Israel is not at fault for another country cheating. Countries lose their rights to have amnesty for civilians and civilian operations when a military does the things Hamas did. It's not black and white for sure, but whatever wrong Israel is doing can wait until after Palestine is annexed my Israel and security is in place.   Now I believe the best thing for Israel to do involves lessening the bombs, but they have to be careful. The  precedent cannot be set that rewards body shielding and other terror attacks. That's the main issue in all of this. If we blame Israel or stop helping them then we are telling Hamas they are not only allowed but encouraged to hide behind civilians. Then there's no way to defeat them.   God bless me for responding to you with actual reasoning when you are a incoherent crybaby who cannot even make a proper argument nonetheless actually have a good point. Maybe you should grow up or go to Palestine.

Back during the transition groups period between the Bernie camp and the Biden camp, there was a notion that Bernies policies would be incorporated by the Biden White House, buts its largely not happened, Bernie responded with passivity, and people remember that too.  Its not Bernie that could have been the savior on Gaza nor one Medicare for All this year. But there are many others who should have challenged him in the primaries, there are people in the administration who have been trying to change Bidens position, there are countless activists across the country that should be supported, and there are legislators who should continue to be pressured.  I hope to see primary challengers against all legislators who have refused to speak out.

It supplied Syria with unlimited weapons and extremist militia fighters which then turned the situation into a sunni-shia conflict.  When Iranian militia and Hezbollah suffed heavy losses to the opposition, that's when Russian airforce actively intervened in exchange for a military base in the Mediterranian Lattakia. Meanwhile, the US provided limited support at the demand of Turkey to prevent the LARGEST REFUGEE CRISIS IN THE WORLD from exacerbating even more. Where did those refugees come from? The cities and towns that were indiscriminately bombed by the Syrian, Iranian, and Russian forces. Sorry this doesn't fit into your "America stealing oil" narrative.

2024-01-24 19:02:38, 0.01085309020283222, reddit_opinion_republican.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: *Thank you*.  I was about to do this exact same exercise, because I was sitting here reading OP's comment going "wtf is he talking about?  There's TONS of examples of non-toxic masculinity."  This isn't that complicated gang.  I really can't understand why young people are struggling with this so much.  I *try* really hard to remember what it was like to be in my late teens to mid 20s, but I *seriously* don't remember it being this complex.  I also don't remember anybody having to give me *an instruction book.*    Feels very much like people are over thinking this, and I think social media facilitates that because it gives people a community to commiserate in rather than working on their hang ups.  Let's start with biology.  Men are *biologically* prone to be larger than women.  That has implications.  First, just like when you're around a large unknown animal (like a horse or something), you're a little wary.  That's how women feel when around unknown men, in general.  However, once you get to know a large animal like a horse, and that horse shows himself to be generally well behaved, maybe with a little bit of a wild hair every once in a while, you can form a good relationship with him, and it's both safe, and a little bit intriguing because that wild hair behavior makes things a little bit spicy.  So safe but spicy/surprising is what you're shooting for.  (It's also why some guys turn to humor, because humor is a low key kind of spicy/surprising, and it works for many women... though there's nothing worse than *forced* humor... though I suppose if you do it *super* badly you might come around the other side to endearing... probably not a good strategy though.)  What misogynists do is go **way** past spicy / surprising and go into *abusive*.  That starts to risk the *safe* part, yeah?  So putting it back into the framing of a horse, once your horse goes from a little surprising to dangerous (or completely ignoring your direction / desires), he's no longer a good horse, and it's tough to recover that trust once it's been violated.  Now where that bit flips for every woman is going to be a little different, but rest assured, the only women you can attract by being misogynistic are women who are *really* insecure, because in their mind they can't do any better.  Society in general has been working on helping raise girls who are far less insecure for at least the last 30, maybe 40 years, and so those women are a smaller and smaller percentage of the population (which is *a good thing* for young women, children, and society as a whole because insecure moms raise insecure or otherwise troubled kids).  So, returning to the horse analogy, how do you feel about a large animal that smothers you?  It's bothersome, isn't it?  I mean it might be great at first, because it gets you past the danger concern fairly quickly, but where's the spice?  There isn't any.  It makes you go:  "What's wrong with this horse?  Why doesn't he care enough about doing horse things, and just wants to smother me?"  That's loosely how a woman feels about a guy who's just gushing all the time, and trying too hard to "be a nice guy."  As I implied, this seems so intuitive to me that I find it puzzling that it even has to be described so basically and with weird analogies like this, but *apparently* that's where we're at.  Nobody really had to *teach* me this as a young man, it really just emerged out of 1) thinking about things from a woman's perspective, and 2) making mistakes and learning from them in my late teens and early 20s.  Finally, +1 for Fred Rogers.  I've loved that man since I was 5 years old.  What a wonderful role model for kids -- think about others, put yourself in their shoes, think through your feelings, name your feelings - don't just react to them, all wonderful examples of things kids (and especially boys) need to learn.

The question is, would you say the US is currently doing what it should to address its role in this? If not, how do you think other countries will respond? To get to net zero there has to be a certain level of scaling back productivity and consumption and therefor development, would more underdeveloped and exploited countries like China and others pursue a strategy of net zero that is out of step with regards to how the US responds here? I am indeed very concerned about it all, and not on a moral basis alone, but based on its real impact in regards to how the world ultimately responds to this.   The reality is the US needs to do a LOT more than it currently is, although I fear that might not be possible under the current political structures in this country, which should gravely concern people, because if US history has shown anything is that this country will probably go the other route and militarily force its interests in the end if it has to instead of upholding its global responsibility. The potentials that come with that should terrify everyone.

While I won't lie and say I think the government tends to be competent that isn't really the main reason I don't want them involved in everything. It always sucks me that leftists simultaneously seem to want to give more power to the state while also taking about each election like it will be the end of democracy. As more concrete examples I find it paradoxical that they want the government more in control of healthcare while there is a very large political movement against abortion and transgender care, just send very risky to me.  That being said there are certain areas that I believe the state does need to be responsible for, enforcing the rule of law being one of those. Does it mean it's competently done, no, but it's just not an area that I think anyone else can really fill the role of.

What do you think the RPG's, rockets and homemade IED's of Hamas and other extremists groups do?  Do they have anti-baby killing technology?

Using babies as weapons is wrong. It's just the uttermost wrong of wrongs that could be wrong.  The decades of financial aid and diplomatic cover buys us control and favors.   Without that "financial aid and diplomatic cover", chances are good Gaza wouldn't exist, nor would the West Bank.  Like in the late 60's, early 70's.  Once Israel had a full state, they'd then wait for someone stupid to strike at them, then they'd annex that state.  Jordan, Syria and Iran wouldn't exist either. It would just be Israel owns the Middle-East.  Our aid saves lives and allows for peace.  Hamas is to blame for all your grievances.

I dont know for sure that Jesus was the son of God or God incarnate, or just a normal human trying to achieve that oneness with his Creator. The thing I have come to learn is that by trying my best to follow the teachings of Jesus, I have become more self-aware of my inner shortcomings, especially analyzing the insidious ways I sometimes rationalize away my motivations of performative philanthropy versus a genuine desire to do/be better. The expectation that you will enjoy a sense of personal satisfaction is in itself contradictory to the requirement of true selflessness. Doing the right thing can make you feel like shit sometimes and thats ok, thats what prayer is for, to learn to make peace with the discomforts of selflessness.   So far its holding true for me that compassion and empathy begin as internal practices that arent fully realized until they become actions in benefit of others without the expectation of recognition, reciprocity, or reward. However, the peace of mind I have gained from having a benign and beneficial intent in my everyday interactions has greatly improved my character, my quality of life, and my ability to be content within whatever circumstances I find myself in. Im going to die anyway, but if I waste my life following a path of selflessness laid out by a mortal philosopher without any real claim to divinity, it will still have been well spent in the pursuit of imitating the philosophy of a man whose name is synonymous with Unconditional Love.  TL/DR: I dont know what Jesuss true nature is, but his teachings help me be a better person, and since Im going to die anyway, I might as well go out staning Jesus since all my other faves are too problematic for the current state of the world.

I went through all that stress and anxiety for absolutely nothing. I made a prison in my own mind by assuming that these negative things or assuming people had these negative thoughts about me in their head. Turns out just doing it and living in the moment, facing reality as it actually is was way more fulfilling and made me way happier than sitting locked in my head imagining negative things that made me feel miserable.   I'm not saying there aren't problems, but I will confidently say that when it comes to this kind of stuff the things that are making people legitimately unhappy are more often than not the problems they're imagining in their heads.

Hamas' aspirational goal is the removal of the State of Israel.  That's a very simplistic way of looking at things and I can literally equate anything in the world by it. For instance - the goal of the Russian is to remove the NATO threat from their borders - wouldn't mean that it's the same as the anti-slavery movement or Hamas. to say that two groups have a goal doesn't mean that the goal is the same or the price of the goal is the same.  >However, it is clearly unrealistic and untenable to accomplish...  While I agree that currently it's unrealistic, I don't think it's what some Palestinians want to happen in the long haul. I don't know if you're familiar with the ask project - you should watch the one about whether Iran should Nuke Israel. I can draw realistic paths for ethnic cleansing of the majority jews from Israel if the western world would turn against it.  >You havent read any of those offers, I can tell.  What makes you say that? give me a poison pill in the 2008 offer. The fact that the Palestinians don't get 100% of what they want isn't a poison pill.

I can also argue on the term and why it doesn't matter that technically you can draw those things, but seriously I have no interest in this as this message is getting pretty long so better to keep it focused.  >Individually sure. But fundamentally with the correct stimuli, sufferring and lack of options, oppressed people follow particular patterns of conduct. The fat kid getting bullied continously will one day, when pushed over the edge use violence against his bully.  Just like the first clame, this is too simplistic and can justify anything. this is literal INCEL language right? the lack of choices, one day being pushed over the edge etc.. I could say I'm being oppressed by people here attacking my country with false information online and make the same claims.. Eventually, it matters just how much options do you have, what are your choices and what can you do. Thus, equating the two and looking at everything as oppressed and oppressors as if these are binaries is kind of not realistic.  >Indeed, I went to school with a refugee who first explained why she had an issue with Israel  I meant the part where you equate them to slaves. you can oppose Israel without equating the Palestinians to slaves. Again, I think it's disrespectful to both groups.     >She was actually the first muslim person I met. Naturally Palestinians currently living there are radicalized... that is the point I have been making, their circumstances radicalize humans. It does not matter that they are Muslim.  Never have I said it matters that they are muslim, I don't see how that's related or why would you even say that. I, growing up in Israel met many muslims, have muslim friends etc.  The actual story is that for political reasons the Palestinians specifically, with the support of the Arab world built this kind of narrative that is as you've said - unrealistic. This narrative keeps them in a bad state. The actual reality is that mass displacements happened in history not once and not twice. They never ended like this.

Given this is based on the Christian view of the person, it constrains these rights based on Christian views of Gender and sexuality; meaning that Same sex marriage is an oxymoron. * Solidarity is the source for economic justice, and from it comes the call for a welfare state, just wage and working hours. From Solidarity also comes policies to support families, policies to support trade unions, and cross-class institutions such as codetermination, alongside regional and national summits where trade unions, employer associations and the Government meet to determine regional and national economic policy. * Subsidiarity is a unique doctrine which is centres around the notion; if a smaller social unit can preform a task, then it should do the task. If that smaller social unit fails, the government should step in. For example: parents get to determine their Children's education. If they failure, the government ensures the children go to a Government school. It also means that Religious organizations can participate in education provision alongside the government. It also means that there need to be international organizations, such as the EU and UN, are needed to support international peace and co-operation. * Stewardship is the source of environmentalism. Usually, Christian Democrats appeal to market mechanisms such as the ETS and Carbon taxes, to ensure a transition.  Two addendums:   * Christian Democrats prefer Consociational Democracy over Majoritarian Democracy. * Christian Democrats would reject "Secular Democracy" - In the various Kulturekampf's across Europe, Bourgeois Liberal parties often attempted to remove religious expression from political life. Christian Democrats instead preferred the US's system which separated church and state, but actively involved Christian political expression.

This other article https://prospect.org/health/rampant-fraudulent-billing-outsourced-veterans-health-care/ states how the 2018 VA mission act also resulted in rampant fraud on the health care provider side of the equation.

We both agree to universal healthcare is the best move forward so lets focus our efforts on trying to get there.

But renewable electricity generation construction is now growing at an impressive speed.  So much so that this year emissions from power generation are expected to be lower than last year.  In a decade or two there will be enough wind and solar that it won't make sense to build more coal power plants, and at that stage there will be less and less coal being dug up.  There will be no incentive to go and find new coal deposits.  The same applies to oil and gas.  If demand for them drops low enough, it won't be worth drilling new wells, and the output from the existing wells will get more expensive.  Major car manufacturers are committing billions of dollars to developing and building EVs.  ICE vehicles are on the way out.  Now is the time for hope, not despair.

They are, however, conductive to contributing significant amounts of GHGs over the tens, hundreds, and millions of years that they are erupting. Stratospheric induced cooling via the injection of aerosols requires much more explosive eruption styles such as those generated by a stratovolcano (Mt. Pinatubo, Mt. Tambora, and Krakatoa), or a super volcano (Toba, Yellowstone, etc.). Furthermore, two other factors must be considered - the location of the eruption (it must occur equatorial), and the composition (it must contain enough aerosols to cause significant cooling).  The P-T extinction was initiated through flood basalt volcanism, synchronous with warming, which was further exacerbated by other inputs from said warming such as destabilizing methane hydrates (clathrates), ocean stratification and ocean anoxia.

Ranked choice voting, east choice that has no real downside and allows for third parties not to be a joke vote.   2. Outlawing any kind of campaign donation from private means and considering it bribery.*   * With an exception. I'm not exactly sure where we should draw the line but we'll say people/parties that poll below 1-5% can still take donations from private sources or use their own funds. If you poll above some arbitrary amount you HAVE to take government money if you want to run legitimately and you HAVE to participate in a debate between everyone who took that money. We can sell the rights to air the debate but it should be mandatory that all parties who poll at some arbitrary percentage(the ones who took the funding) have to participate in it. If they really want to they still can host their own separate republican/democrat debate, but all major parties have to be present for the government sanctioned debate too, that way all voices can be heard.   3. Ban congresspeople from trading stocks. Pretty simple, but they write the rules. They shouldn't be allowed to own stock. I believe the government itself should be able to own stock, but the money gained from the dividends should be given back to citizens one way or another or used to pay off the deficit.   4.

Just wanted to add another paper that talks about possible future outcomes, https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810141115  It talks about the remaining window of time available to steer climate change towards a stable state, between +2 and +3 degrees, before a series of tipping points are passed that would result in positive feedback and run away warming and unpredictability.   The relevant point for your question is:  "trends and decisions occurring over the next decade or two could significantly influence the trajectory of the Earth System for tens to hundreds of thousands of years"  They suggest that in the worst possible case it would take the same as the natural interglacial cycle to correct the climate, about 100,000 years. It could be a lot less if extremes can be avoided but we're still talking hundreds or thousands of years.  Even if we could magically stop producing CO2 and remove all the excess from the atmosphere, the temperature would not immediately come down. Things like increased reflection of sunlight by glaciers and sea ice could take 50+ years to return to what it was. The sea would also be releasing the heat it has already stored for decades. Sea level rise over the next few hundred years from thermal expansion alone is already locked in. Things like regrowth of mature forests that have burned would take a couple of centuries. Formation of peat bogs, methane locked in permafrost or undersea methane clathrates would happen over a thousand years or more.   The 'good' news is that most models show runaway warming in the worst case to level off between +4 and +5 degrees, rather than continuing until the earth is like Venus... But that is still unimaginably apocalyptic and possibly not survivable for humans, even in an animalistic state with small niche ecosystems, let alone with anything resembling civilisation...

Even though I'm very critical of zionism in  concept and the way in which it materialized i try not not focus on that because the truth of the matter is that it happened and even if someone believes it shouldn't habe happened at all to undo it would be an extremely hypocritical argument at it's core and also extremely unrealistic. It's been generations and many people there no nowhere else. Questioning the validatity of whether it was the ancestral home of the Jewish people doesn't change that it is the home for millions of people now.   I believe that both a one state and a two state solution are possible but after listening to both sides i think what to call a one state solution might be the biggest obstacle   I've always felt like both sides are just working themselves up more and more about how much they hate the other side but that they'll quickly get the **** over it once the Leaders on both sides set their egos and powertrips aside and genuinely work on ending the occupied and ensuring the freedom of Palestinian people   When it comes to the people in illegal settlements however I think their ability to stay is going to have to be the call of the Palestinian people. I think reparations in exchange for land trades could maybe work or maybe agreements that allow their municipalities some level of guaranteed autonomy within a Palestinian state.   While it would be unfair to place all blame on Israel In general reparations in some form especially for Gazans i think is in order any amount of generational wealth people had in almost certainly lost now plus the blockade definitely crippled their economy for many years. I know they never would but America definitely owes reparations to Cuba for doing the same sh*t still to this day (sorry i feel strongly about that one because of my cuban ancestory lmao)

Yea, people who question something so fundamental like the greenhouse effect have dug themselves in a really deep hole. That is very basic science that can almost been proven socratically by starting with 'why do you think your car is warm on a cold day?'.  The main OP doesn't make a coherent case here to really respond against. I wish I could respond better but I don't know exactly what their point is.  They say:  >To turn ice core data into temperatures the scientist melts the ice then boils the water in a tightly controlled space and evaluates the gasses that come out of the sample. A computer model is used to convert the mix of gases into a temperature. These models are very clever and quite involved. If you assume that CO2 forces temperature change, you get one set of temperature numbers. If you assume that changes in CO2 are a result of temperature change you get a very different set of temperature numbers.  I don't know what they're talking about here. Ice core data temperature comes from measuring oxygen or hydrogen isotopes, there's no CO2 model involved. It's well established that the ratio of heavy to light oxygen/hydrogen atoms is dependent on temperature. When the global temperatures are cool there is more light oxygen atoms locked up in ice at the poles, this changes the ratio of heavy to light in the ocean and in the ice. This also affects other things like coral. And of course there are other methods of determining temperature in the geologic record.

If youre legitimately trying to persuade Israelis to stay and build a multi ethnic state, what sort of message does it send when you uncritically call for ceasefire without protesting Hamas, just as strongly?  The truth is, most of these people either a- havent thought these issues through that clearly, or b- dont really want a multiethnic single state. They want the Jews of Israeli to flee because they dont regard them as legitimately entitled to citizenship in the state they are advocating for.

Gasoline is a hydrocarbon. The hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water. The carbon combines with oxygen to form CO2.   Note the formula for CO2: two oxygen atoms for every one carbon atom. Carbon has an atomic weight of 12, oxygen has an atomic weight of 16. So a molecule of CO2 has a combined weight of 44 (12+16+16).   The weight of CO2 divided by the weight of carbon is how much weight is gained by burning or the uniting with oxygen. 44/12 equals 3.6666... which we round up to 3.7 for sake of convenience. Thus, we multiply 3.7 to the weight of carbon in gasoline to find the weight of CO2 produced by burning that carbon.  Figuring out the weight of carbon in gasoline is lengthy because there are over a 100 different kind of hydrocarbons and additives in gasoline. The simplest is iso-octane which is C4H9. Using atomic weights as above we get 57 of which 48 is carbon. 48/57 is roughly .85carbon would be roughly 85 percent the weight in iso-octane. Online, you'll find a value of 87 percent of the weight of gasoline is carbon.  A gallon of gas weighs 6.3 pounds. Carbon accounts for 87 percent of that, so 5.5 pounds in carbon. When that carbon burns with oxygen, we multiply 5.5 by 3.7, and get 20.35 pounds.

IMO, you can't dump the entirety of the blame on the individual as there are a number of limitations in what an individual can do either due to a lack of ressources (i.e. money) from their part and a limitation in the services society can offer (ex: no renewables). So if you are driving an SUV and eating meat everyday, yeah you have to do something about that, you can't just expect the world to magically save itself. On the other hand, if you have limited all your emissions and the only emissions left to neutralize are stuff related to the power source or things you can't afford because you don't have enough money, the system should enable you to become carbon neutral.  Arguments about individual responsibility also ignore the fact that this a global, systemic problem so having a bunch of carbon neutral individuals is helpful but it doesn't solve the problem. There is still a need for a global systemic solution.  Last I'd like to point out that politicians and other decision makers are aware of Climate Change and even accept part of the responsibility in finding a solution. The UNFCCC wasn't imposed on anyone. They however are doing everything in their power to not to have to act. So they keep up the amazing show which is the COP, every year and every year they promise the same things during elections but fail to deliver on them for this or that reason.

2024-04-14 18:34:58, 0.01085309020283222, reddit_opinion_republican.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: Article:  ABC News is among a unified grouping of the five chief broadcast and cable news networks, along with major wire, print and radio organizations, that have penned an open letter asking presidential candidates to publicly commit to taking part in televised debates ahead of the general election.  In addition to ABC News, the letter is signed by CBS News, CNN, NBCUniversal News Group and FOX News Media, along with The Associated Press, C-SPAN, NewsNation, Noticias Univision (Univision Network News), NPR, PBS NewsHour and USA TODAY.  "With the contours of the 2024 general election now coming into clear focus, we -- the undersigned national news organizations -- urge the presumptive presidential nominees to publicly commit to participating in general election debates before November's election," the letter, published on Sunday, reads.  This unusual move comes amid an election cycle during which the practice of debates, a decades-old American campaign tradition, has been met with uncertainty from both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.  Trump, who skipped all four Republican National Committee-sanctioned 2024 primary election debates and pulled out of one of his three debates with Biden in 2020, has enthusiastically urged Biden to participate in the three general debates scheduled for this fall -- a position echoed by his campaign again on Sunday.  "President Trump has been very clear: he is willing to debate Joe Biden any time, any where, any place. We once again call on Joe Biden to commit to debates," spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.  The Biden campaign has expressed concern with the organization of these debates by the Commission on Presidential Debates, signaling that the nonpartisan group that has sponsored the events since the 1980s has been unclear about their ability to administer a "fair" debate with Trump.  In April 2022, the Republican National Committee also voted unanimously to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates.  The Biden campaign declined to comment on the new letter but the president has previously played down Trump's eagerness to get on stage with him.  "Well if I were him I'd want to debate me, too. He's got nothing else to do," Biden told reporters in February.  "General election debates have a rich tradition in our American democracy, having played a vital role in every presidential election of the past 50 years, dating to 1976. In each of those elections, tens of millions have tuned in to watch the candidates debating side by side, in a competition of ideas for the votes of American citizens," the media organizations urged in their letter.  "If there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high. Amidst that backdrop, there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of our nation," the letter concludes.  Biden has mostly avoided commenting publicly on engaging in debate with Trump. Asked following his State of the Union address in March if he would commit to one, Biden remarked to ABC News: "It depends on his behavior."  The Democratic National Committee, which has thrown all of its support behind Biden, did not hold any primary election debates this cycle despite the urging of his long shot challengers. There is no precedent for an incumbent president to have participated in a primary debate, however, since the first modern debate was held in 1948-- even when presented with high-profile primary opponents.  Trump's campaign is still lobbying hard for general election debates against Biden. On Thursday, the former president's senior campaign advisers sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates calling for "much earlier" and "more" presidential debates than initially proposed, saying voting is beginning "earlier and earlier."  "Voting is beginning earlier and earlier, and as we saw in 2020, tens of millions of Americans had already voted by the time of the first debate," top Trump campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in the letter.  "Specific to the Commission's proposed 2024 calendar, it simply comes too late," they wrote, listing estimates of how many votes Americans will have likely voted by current proposed dates.  The two claimed Americans were "robbed of a true and robust" debate in 2020 because the debate commission accepted the Biden campaign's wish amid the coronavirus pandemic.  In 2020, there were only two debates involving Biden and Trump. A third scheduled debate was canceled after the former president backed out because it was moved from being an in-person to virtual event because of COVID-19.  Trump then attacked the commission, claiming he would not accept any of their changes intended to enforce the rules and limit interruptions at the remaining presidential debates.  The RNC's vote in 2022 to pull back from comission-sanctioned debates mandated that candidates pledge not to participate in them. The national party has not revised its position.  The commission has announced it plans to hold the first debate on Sep. 16 at Texas State University, the second on Oct. 1 at Virginia State University and the third on Oct. 9 at The University of Utah, Salt Lake City. It plans to hold a vice presidential debate on Sept. 25 at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania.

It does say that traditional scientific methods cannot keep up with the rapid pace of anthropogenic climate change. It provides the technical reasons for this statement and these are not in dispute by scientists themselves.  The decision of junior scientists to continue to work within these limitations is understandable and this is acknowledged even if a number of them, in the desperate context, have taken to direct action protests instead or simultaneously.  You appear to be of the view that funding decisions are entirely outwith the control of senior scientists - this is not the case. They have a lot of influence in how these decisions are made. Suggestions are made in the article for how they could re-divert some funding to methods which could keep up with what is happening as well as how they re-align their own working priorities to meet the needs of this situation.   Furthermore these senior scientists are at liberty to speak to the media and other organisations to communicate live what they observe to be happening - rather than wait for long periods to prove this via the long-term methods. The IPCC is equally free to change their MO in order to discharge their responsibility to advise policymakers on what is actually happening with the climate, and not only rely what scientific methods can prove.  This is all made clear in the article. You are the first not to have understood these points it seems - which have been welcomed by many scientists themselves.

If someone had 10 million dollars in an IRA at age 72, they would be required to withdraw $365,000 that year, which suffice to say is not in the 22% or 24% tax bracket. Half that to 5 million total keeps you in the 24% tax bracket at $180,000 RMD, but then we are talking about a number easily achievable with normal 401k limits(50,000 a year combined employee/employer, over 30 years, with 7% annual return).  And if there is money left in the account by the death of the original saver, then the beneficiary will have to immediately start withdrawing RMDs and paying income tax on those.

This is speculation, but I think we'll see a full disengagement by the Israelis after the war; No Palestinians getting work permits, no Palestinians getting treated in Israeli hospitals, no Palestinians being able to make their way into Israel's streets.

This allowed the wealthy to cheaply invest in the kinds of financial assets that don't lead to economic cycling (futures, stock buybacks, investment real estate) between 2018-2019 taxes were lowered, and regulations on investing were shed.  2020 with the FED already at 0% there was no where left to go when COVID hit. So the lenders were already being picky about who they lent to (since lower rates drive a higher debt to liquidity ratio) so the average Joe couldn't take advantage of the lower rates unless they had sizable assets in the first place.   Then, the large borrowers who leveraged their debts in 2019 for profit were bailed out in 2020. Having already made their profit, their losses were socialized, while the average Joe got about a months rent paid out while being locked out of the workforce for several months.  With the deficit already record high in 2018, again in 2019, and further inflated by short term economic policy in 2019 (which created a very short term spike in GDP, that would've only lasted into 2020 had COVID not happened, just long enough for all the incumbents to wave a flashy number during the election year before it evaporated) left our economy incredibly top heavy, with no tools available besides literally printing money to ease a crisis.   Tldr: our government spent the grocery money on hookers and blow, then, when everybody got hungry we served a feast to the fastest cats in the county, and told everybody else they should've eaten some of the dinner they weren't invited to.

Also, raw numbers is a pants-on-head regarded way to judge the morality behind the actions. *There is* a difference between collateral damage and going out of your way to kill civilians, or do you think that when the allies bombed the fuck out of Germany directly killing hundreds of thousands to potentially literally *millions* of civilians that was genocide or terrorism? Do you think that the allies should have sat down with Germany and appeased them to avoid war? Sometimes war is necessary, and with war comes terrible costs that we should try to minimize as best we can and Israel is far from perfect but they have a right to defend themselves and no other nation would be expected to put up with a genocidal death cult constantly lobbing thousands of rockets aimed at their civilian population.

It's really only Israel where politicians go out of the way to justify suxh actions. They'll someimes stay quiet and ignore certain human rights abuses, but they won't passionately defend them.  The US literally gives Israel the most military aid by a long way, and there are no conditions. So that plays a part as we are directly complicit in a way we aren't in other countries.  You don't hear people with connections from China or Saudi rant on about racism when anyone tries to point out the horrific human rights abuses these countries commit. They tend to just agree how terrible it is. So there is no debate.  Does the US veto any UN resolution other than the ones against Israel? Israel is given special treatment compared to other countries.  Finally, Ukraine there is lots of coverage and condemnation about Russias actions. People haven't been quiet at all. But more importantly our politicians  are aligned with the publics views. What would the point be of protesting as our government's are already doing what we want.

Such as their continued theft and occupation of Palestinian land. Having more than 100 settlements in the West Bank that are deemed to be in clear violation of international laws. Which has left many thousands of Palestinians destitute and without a home. And then in Gaza we have the extremely high number of civilian casualties. With the IDF seemingly doing nothing to protect innocent civilians. Dropping bombs on evacuation routes, hospitals, schools, and marked journalist zones. The number of innocent people killed in this conflict is ridiculous. And the Israeli government has made no attempt to prove that they're trying to minimize unnecessary harm, nor that they don't plan to occupy the land once this is all over.

Appeasement dont work with terrorist. They had this chance 2005 in Gaza and choose to elect Hamas in 2006 with around 44%. For a comparison: Germans elected NSDAP with around 32% - no one denies today that the Germans werent Nazis.  My point: they made their choice. And I find it western patronizing to treat them like toddlers and deny that.   So, the question would be: how to denazify Palestinians (like the allies did successfully with the Germans) - and if thats even possible, as Islam never underwent secularization (would be my question, idk.)

LA was woefully out of spec with national environmental air quality standards, then California passed standards that were even tougher than the national standards, which incidentally both brought LA in line with the national standards and made sure that the rest of the state couldn't fall below those standards anytime soon.  So there's interplay between the standards.  But certainly car fuel emission standards in California have been stronger than national standards for some time. Since most car manufacturers don't want to be excluded from the California market, this means that they generally adhere to the higher standard (or make two versions of the car, although this is more and more infeasible).  California being the (5th?) largest economy in the world if it were to be treated as its own country means that they wield an awful lot of influence if they decide to pass a state law that requires certain standards or regulations to be met, _regardless of the national standards_.

However you choose to account for it, it's likely a double digit share of the whole pie. And if we're going to reduce in other sectors and keep food unchanged - then the relative contributions are going to grow.  Besides emissions, agriculture is a leading cause of biodiversity loss.  Also, there is no single "silver bullet" to solving climate change - we must engage in all sectors. The exceptional part with agriculture is that we can all participate, with our daily choices. Everybody can't neccessarily buy an electric vehicle, or change their heating to low carbon energy. But everyone can change their diets, more in the direction of low carbon diets. The other thing thats nice is that methane emissions have a very rapid impact on climate, and few would argue time isnt of the essence.   Trying to argue that agriculture and diets don't matter, seems to be more of an excuse for not doing anything about one's habits. Even if it's a valid thing to point to the importance of fossil fuels of course. Whenever we engage in downplaying the importance of valid climate mitigation strategies, we're engaging in whataboutism though.

The Iraq war was sad but Im not sure the mens rea is there. If we are operating under the assumption that Bush knew everything before he made his address to Saddam then yeah obviously that would be a horrible way to bring us into war however Saddam was in possession of yellow cake uranium and chemical munitions albeit ones that were outdated they still had them. If I told you hold this expired zyclon b would you do it? I doubt it right.   There is definitely evidence to suggest the CIA was just there to fuck shit including the embellishment of the original British intelligence report they used as the proof. However it was discovered many years later Saddam in fact hoped to warm relations with the west in hopes theyd ease restrictions on him so he could then reinstate his chemical and nuclear weapons program as well as his super gun to allegedly shoot nukes? That last bit is sketchy I just learned about the super gun lol.   Preventing dictatorships from getting nuclear weapons while they are ethnically cleansing their rivals in the region and actively torturing people themselves seems like a just cause to me. Though the method in which we got to the end result obviously wasnt great.   As far as the actual invasion of Iraq Id like it noted that coalition forces for the most part passed by smaller towns on their way to Baghdad with some exception depending on the strategic value. Though when battles came to the streets the Americans distributed leaflets to allow non combatants to escape because Saddams forces had taken up positions in the towns to defend them. During this time coalition forces were pitched against not only saddams forces but his loyalist supporters who took up arms to defend him. Those deaths were likely reported as civilian deaths if I had to guess.   The major misstep in the aftermath of the war was the US not taking the time to understand the culture traditions of Iraq. Soon after the fall of Saddam the cities became lawless hives of looters and armed militants putting up resistance to coalition forces. Shia and Sunni Muslim groups began open conflict as the Sunni felt they had been oppressed(they were lol) by the Shia so they took revenge on their captors en mass.    That was all just in the initial wake of the war and as the situation developed Iraq went totally rogue for a while and became a terrorist haven as many jihadist groups came to salvage power and munitions from the area as well as try their luck against US assets.   As a whole Id say that the means to an end were wrong but the overall effect of stopping Saddam saved countless more lives than it took in iraq. A lot of people throw around that million civilians number without really diving into it, its attributed to sanctions over the years against Iraq as well as Iraqi displacement and obviously real civilian casualties that are obviously inevitable in war.   Id harp on something thats been said a lot lately, the number does not determine who is right and wrong and who is just and who is not. It simply quantifies the cost of such actions and we would do well to remember it as I think we do fairly well.

Generally, Consider the impacts of arctic amplification - expect your area to warm 1.5-2x the global average land temperature. Greater impact of droughts (And perhaps flash droughts) or longer droughts, Forests fires (if there's forest around you) increasing in rate and severity, early frosts out of nowhere, or false-springs, etc. Expect temperature and humidity levels to surpass the optimal for many crops - potatoes, corn, wheat, etc- during heat waves that are longer and hotter over time.   Also, keep in that the impacts of both mitigation and adaptation. A carbon tax will need to be seriously implemented at some point (not this piddly thing the Libs have implemented) - this will mean the current tax will need to increase at 8-10% y/y, starting soon, and going for decades. The IPCC puts forward numbers such as ~$2,000 / ton by 2050 (Or ~ $600/ton by 2030) imagine how that would impact your operation? Also, The medium-long term impact on the availability of heavy steel machinery (need lots of fossil fuels, global trade networks, exploitation of child slaves, etc) is doubtful in a world that seriously tries to effect climate action. Also, your nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers are likely from the Haber-Bosch and phosphate rock mining industries - both heavily dependent and reliant on fossil fuels - expect these to increase in price greatly, or reduce in availability (or both!). Look at moving to local fertilization, crop rotation, silvopasture, etc methods (if you're not already) in order to localize your supply chain as a buffer against market and resource instabilities caused by climate change. Expect it to become harder - when have changes ever been good for farmers? The rest of society undervalues the role of agriculture and food production.    On the adaptation side, extensive water capture and storage facilities would be highly suggested, as you will be facing increasingly severe (And possibly lengthy) droughts. Not sure if you have an aquifer there, and how it's projected stores are looking if so. I know wells are becoming harder to depend on - my family has 3 sections in Alberta (for over 100 yrs now) and our 5th well (200ft) just ran dry. Shipping in water for the cattle weekly now.  Expect this, but more and worse. Local resilience and redundancy for basic needs - feed, water, drought-resistant crops, etc. will be key. Diversify crops and terrains - try some multi-layered perennial food forests, some machine-harvest ready crops, some drought-resistant crops, greenhouse crops, mushrooms, semi-tropical fruits) etc. The classics won't work anymore, and adaptation, breeding, and diversification will be the name in the game in insulating yourself from climate chaos caused production shocks.   On the other hand, there could be some benefits. There will likely be more extensive carbon capture and sequestration projects put into place - perhaps there will be more carbon credits for increasing terrestrial sequestration, or reforesting part of your land, etc. I know there are carbon credits in Alberta to do with seed drills already - this could expand, and those with lots of land will be a prime target for such endeavors.

Over the past year, the only case of death of conscripts was during shelling in the Belgorod region in 2023. 2 conscripts died as far as I remember.  Russia has increased its army, but not through mobilization. I'm talking about that. The main replenishment of the army is people signing a contract with the army.  And yes. according to the statistics of the Russian medical service 97% of the wounded return to the front. And the death toll in the Russian army is unlikely to exceed 80k people in two years . Even the head of the CIA, William Burns, recently stated that Russia's total losses (wounded and killed) amount to 300k people. The ratio of killed is 1 to 3 wounded.   And these are statements from Russia's opponents, who probably overestimated the losses.

That may be true, but it isn't going to make a noticeable difference in this case. "Slower" here means a couple of decades at most (by the time we stop changing the climate). Given that we're talking about 5+ degrees of warming, maybe double that, then this difference is insignificant. Also, given the dynamics of the free market, even this amount of slowing down is very optimistic -- as soon as people stop consuming, the market price falls, which just makes fossil fuels available to poorer consumers. This is how free markets work -- the whole point of them is to find buyers for what sellers want to sell. All this effects is the price, and that is entirely irrelevant to climate change.  >It's also not true that we will inevitably burn all the fossil fuels. The stone age didn't end because we ran out of stones, right?  The stone age ended because humans figured out how to make bronze, and that made stone obsolete. Should somebody invent some new sort of technology that makes fossil fuels obsolete then this would indeed be a massive game-changer, but it is also a fantasy: there is no sign whatsoever of such a technology being developed, and very good scientific reasons to expect it not to happen. Even usable nuclear fusion wouldn't do it unless it was very cheap.  >The consensus among scientists and economists on carbon pricing to mitigate climate change is similar to the consensus among climatologists that human activity is responsible for global warming.  And that's why the lie is so damaging. People really believe this. You believe it. But it is a lie, and I have explained why in the opening post. Don't believe the consensus. **Think for yourself**.  >Do you actually believe you have a better grasp of the problem than the world's scientists and economists?  I have a better grasp than the world's mainstream economists, yes. These are the same people who don't understand the physical limits to growth. Their entire academic discipline is intellectually and morally bankrupt. Economics is subservient to politics, not ecology, and the result is dangerous nonsense. As for the scientists...I strongly suspect that most climate scientists, if you could ask them privately, would agree with every word I have written. I personally know two climate scientists (one a PhD, one a university professor, married couple) and they do agree. Unfortunately, scientists are limited in what they can say in public about this, because of the politics. They do not want to be the ones to put their heads above the parapet with a message this politically controversial. The ones I know have moved to a remote location and are prepping as hard as they can.

[here](https://split-ticket.org/house-generic-ballot-estimates-2008-2022-shave/#jp-carousel-7448) is split ticket's analysis of the generic ballot in 2022 in each state, adjusted for noncontested seats. it's impossible to get exact numbers everywhere, but i think split ticket does a good job of filling in the blanks. [here](https://yapms2.com/app?m=4ye6l7hd839fsow) is that same map transposed onto an electoral college map. the tipping point state on that map is wisconsin, which voted r+1.8. the national generic ballot was r+1.59, which is good for a hypothetical electoral college advantage for republicans of 0.21%, which is really a negligible amount.  now this isn't a perfect metric, because there are some areas that will certainly vote much differently in 2024 than they did in 2022 (new york isn't voting d+11 again,  most of the deep red states are going to move to the right with trump on the ballot, etc). but i think that the post-dobbs 2022 coalitions are at the very least just as strong of an indicator for 2024 as the pre-dobbs 2020 coalitions, which would be a good sign for us come next november.  tl;dr: we can still win in an environment where the popular vote is relatively even

Israel is not committing genocide but Palestinians who elected Hamas do actually want a genocide from the river to the sea.  A few questions for you:  does Hamas want genocide against Jews? What would Hamas have to do in order for you to say yes they want genocide? Would they have to put it in writing in their charter?  Do Palestinians support genocide?  What does a one state solution  where they rename it Palestine- run by Arabs / Palestinians- look like for Jews?

They jump from job to job, because they think they should have instant means to live the luxury life, because they'd never been taught, that stability is built up over time.  * *We see continually young people who make above the median income, who complain that they can't make it, and they are living paycheck to paycheck... never realizing that their life is spent in a continual circle of 'chasing status imagery by every means" and will spend their last dime in pursuit of it.*  Many think the words "College Student"' is some special designation that they don't have to be civic and personally responsible, or responsible to maintain their own lives and own upkeep!!!  They see it as if "they are somehow special" within some protected category.  * Many don't face the truth until they "come out with a piece of paper" and find out they are $200-300K in debt, *unaware of which direction to go, and strapped for the next 20+ years paying that debt.* * They never realize, they are profit makers for 4 yrs, who are encumbered for the next 20+ years to the wealthy who hold the bonds that back that debt and receive their dividends for the next 20 yrs collecting it from those students paying back that debt.    * What many don't realize is, those wealthy parents who paid to get their kids in schools they did not qualify for, already have the high paying jobs sewed up for their kids once they finish their 4 yrs of *partying and good time expedition* on campus.   \_\_\_\_  We have millions of young people who are every day working people, who are "working" bouncing from job to job, wondering why they don't have the big house and fancy car, and wrap themselves in debt, trying to live the life of people who have put in 20-30 years to have a nice home and nice vehicles and etc. These young people "want the stylish home and the marquee car" **right away**, and they become "debt slaves", blind to the fact of how politics impact and affect their everyday lives.

Everything is very well documented: https://saturday-october-seven.com/  Israel agreed to partition the land and live in peace plenty of times. Starting in the 30s getting only 20% of the land, 47 UN partition plan, Barak giving them 100% of Gaza + 97% of the WB + parts of Jerusalem with airspace control and a road connecting Gaza to the WB, and many other opportunities.  The answer is always the same. Refusal, no counter offer, war.  The Palestinians are getting billions a year from plenty of sources. UNRWA alone is around 1.6BN$ with most going to the WB and Gaza Palestinians. Which in total if you were to count the difference donations is more aid than Israel is receiving by both numbers and a huge difference by % (Around 2% aid to Israel compared to Israel's yearly budgets, versus around 100% to the Palestinians).  First it was the Arab nations propping them up for terrorism. Now it is western nations. Only once they will be held accountable, for the first time since they chose to call themselves Palestinians (Less than a 100 years, arguably around 50 years), will there finally be peace.

But this "trying to mend things" was already happening. Why do you think so many Gazans were working in Israel, getting medical treatment, aid, electricity, gas etc. before the war? Plus all the NGOs that strived to normalize relations (some of whose members were murdered on Oct 7th). Gazans have had 17 years to learn the consequences of Hamas' actions towards Israel: Hamas attacks, Israel bombs and potentially sends in troops - way more Gazans are killed than Israelis. Yet in 17 years the only notable "resistance" directed at Hamas was a pathetic protest numbering a few thousand regarding poor wages. Nothing about how many Gazans were getting killed.  Peace takes two, so far they can't even manage a ceasefire with a border. It'll be a while before tangible steps are taken.

And what makes you think that upon giving the Palestinians a state, they will respect the basic human rights of Israelis?  The fundamental issue is that you are looking at this problem through the lens of liberal universalism. This is the same ideology that attempted to bring democracy to Iraq and women's rights to Afghanistan. What it fails to recognize is that some cultures are fundamentally different than other cultures. Palestinians are told, from the moment they are born, that Israel is a fundamentally illegitimate state, its people are illegitimate, and therefore any manner of violence against them is legitimate. This is why they tied women to trees, this is why they gangraped them, and this is why they butchered them.  Israelis, time and time again, make the same fundamental mistake in thinking that by engaging with the Palestinians they can achieve peace. They dump money in, thinking that by making their life better they will have something to lose and thus won't do what they want to do. And time and time and time again, they do it. How do I know this? Because just prior to the 2nd Intifada, the Palestinian economy was the best its ever been. Just prior to October 7th, the Gazan economy was the best its ever been. When they have the means to do it, they will do it. Giving them a state will just give them the greater means to do what they want to do.  Look, the idea that Palestinians are at all interested in nation building is a fiction. How do I know this? Because there is raw sewage flowing in the streets of Gaza. They have multiple universities in Gaza and around 50% unemployment, and they cannot dig a sewer system that drains in the sea? This is hundreds if not thousands of years old technology. Certainly they are more than qualified at digging subterranean tunnels, no? They do not because they are not interested in nation building, they are simply interested in killing Israelis. The moderate Fatah? The infrastructure in Area A of the West Bank is decaying and something like 70% of their outlays go towards paying the salaries of those who kill Israelis.   >Its immoral.  Immoral to whom? Most states are immoral. It is a luxury to be a moral state surrounded by other moral states. Russia is an immoral state, it is killing Ukrainians as we speak. Iran is an immoral state, it brutally rapes teen girls in prison for not wearing the hijab. Azerbaijan is an immoral state, it just ethnically cleansed the Armenians out of Nagorno-Karabakh.

This was dated February 13, 2023  *Edit:  This letter was written by the social security administration to Bernie Sanders in "response to your request for our estimates of the financial effects on Social Security of enacting the Social Security Expansion Act, which you introduced today."  From the proposal:  We estimate that enactment of these provisions would extend the ability of the OASDI program to pay scheduled benefits in full and on time throughout the 75-year projection period. The date of projected depletion of the combined OASI and DI Trust Fund reserves is 2035 under current law and the intermediate assumptions of the 2022 Trustees Report  The proposal includes nine provisions with direct effects on the OASDI program. The following list briefly describes these provisions:  Section 2. Increase the first primary insurance amount (PIA) bend point above the current- law level, and increase the first PIA factor from 90 to 95, for all OASDI benefits payable based on eligibility for January 2024 and thereafter. Increase the first PIA bend point by 22 percent for benefits payable for eligibility in 2024 and later, regardless of when any beneficiary became initially eligible. Increase the first PIA factor by 5 percentage points, for a PIA factor of 95 percent for benefit eligibility in 2024 and later. Page 2  The Honorable Bernie Sanders  Section 3. Use the increase in the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) rather than the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), effective for December 2025 and later COLAs. We assume this change would increase the COLA by an average of 0.2 percentage point per year.  Section 4. Increase the special minimum PIA for workers who become newly eligible for retirement or disability benefits or die in 2024 or later. For workers becoming newly eligible or dying in 2024, the minimum initial PIA for workers with 30 or more years of coverage (YOCs) is 125 percent of the annual poverty guideline for a single individual, as published by the Department of Health and Human Services for 2023, divided by 12. For workers becoming newly eligible or dying after 2024, the minimum initial PIA increases by the growth in the national average wage index (AWI).  Section 5. Continue benefits for children of disabled, or deceased workers until they attain age 22 if the child is in high school, college, or vocational school, beginning in 2024.  Sections 6 and 7. Apply the combined OASDI payroll tax rate on earnings above $250,000, effective for 2024 and later. Tax all earnings once the current-law taxable maximum exceeds $250,000. Do not credit the additional taxed earnings for benefit purposes.  Section 8a. Apply a separate 12.4-percent tax on investment income as defined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), payable to the OASI and DI Trust Funds with unindexed thresholds as in the ACA, effective for 2024 and later. The ACA thresholds are $200,000 for a single filer and $250,000 for a married couple filing jointly. Under this provision, there is no limit on the amount taxed.  Section 8b. Apply a 16.2-percent net investment income (NII) tax on active S-corporation holders and active limited partners, effective for 2024 and later. Of the total 16.2 percent tax, 12.4 percentage points would be payable to the OASI and DI Trust Funds, and 3.8 percentage points would be payable to the General Fund of the Treasury.  Section 9. Combine the current separate Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Funds into a single Social Security Trust Fund, effective January 1, 2024.  edit* formatting  second edit*: To promote a moderate environment, I think it's important for us all to discuss the disagreements and hear arguments from every side.

Most Arab countries want peace and stability, which precludes allowing millions of radicalized Nazi Jihadists into the country.  In any case, Im glad youre out of Syria. That country is screwed as long as Assad is around. He straight up gassed people to death just like Saddam did. I know very little about Syrian civilians, but nobody deserves that. Maybe once hes gone, Syria will sign on to the Abraham Accords along with the ones signed on already, plus Saudi Arabia and others to go along with them.  Be well.

Some have said they want to Euphrates to the Nile. Radical zionists have been all in favor of the more nakbas.   Radical Zionism unabashedly appears to want to do ethnic cleansing.   Of course not all zionists. Many zionists just want to feel good about Israel.  But theres an amount of radical zionists that actually want to be on the offensive. Take over Jordan and parts of Syria, the whole of the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai.   So its best to condemn that sect of Zionism because this is the 21st century and displacing (and murdering) people and then annexing territory because youve got a better military is not an okay thing to do.   A lot of people assume this is all Zionists, and everyone who is pro-Israel.   I also think many people get defensive when you call them anti-Semitic for believing the actions and views of radical Zionists are not ethical or justifiable in this day and age. They dont mean all Jewish people when they criticize Israel, and its annoying when people equate that. Theyre talking about the aggressive and non-defensive actions taken by settlers. There is also a big open question about whether asking 1 million people to leave northern Gaza would make it so they couldnt return, like another nakba. So people get skeptical of whether Israel expediently using Hamass aggression (that totally has a justification for defense and Israel has every right to defend itself) as a vehicle to exile more gazans and annex part of Gaza. Some radical Zionists have expressed they want to do this.   Thats what they mean. At least many do. I cant speak for everyone. But thats my perspective  TLDR: anti-Zionism is about stopping israel aggression, not their right to defend themselves

I will add, one of Amin al-Husseini most destructive actions which continues to haunt and punish the Palestinian people to this day is how kicked out all the moderates, especially his rivals, the Nashashibi clan. While the Nashashibi's were no fans of the Jews, they saw the big picture, and advocated for a two state solution. Had they not been kicked out, Palestine would be a thriving state / regional power player.  Rabbi Avraham Shlomo Zalman Zoref ("), was an Ashkenazi Jew who made Aliyah in **1811**. He was one of the first pioneers to establish the Ashkenazi Jewish community in Jerusalem.  His life's dream was to rebuild the ancient Hurva synagogue which was burned by local Arabs in the 1720s. That proved to be difficult due to the Pact Of Umar - a Muslim pact which restricted the repair of non-Muslim houses of worship.  That all changed when in 1836, the Rabbi finally get the Firman (Ottoman approval) and the reconstruction began. The synagogue was the first Ashkenazi Jewish synagogue in the new era.  Rebuilding the synagogue against Muslim tradition which didn't allow Jews to repair synagogues, angered the local Arabs, and they were seeking revenge against the Rabbi. For a while he paid off the local Arab leaders for peace, but new leaders rose and the Arab settlement grew, he had to stop paying them. That bought him many enemies.  They tried to kill him twice. The first time an assassin tried to shoot him but missed; the shooter was found dead the next day. The second time a group of Arabs caught him on his way to the Vatikin prayer in "Menahem Zion" synagogue. They hit him with swords in the head. He survived for 10 more months until in 1851 he died from his brain injury.

US output also greatly increased in 2023 and has continued to rise in 2024 as OPEC+ has continued its output cuts in an effort to drive global prices sky-high. In other words, US production increases are the only thing that's kept global prices from skyrocketing in recent years, while global inflation is already well above the average.   >In fact a sensible policy to reduce US energy costs would have been to restore the ban on exports  But if oil and gas become cheaper domestically, that would deeply undercut efforts to adopt green energy since it wouldn't be cost effective...  >The most insane thing about the Nordstream destruction was that instead of using the opportunity to invest in rapidly building out renewables, with US prompting, countries like Germany immediately committed tens of billions of Euros for new LNG terminals.  ...because it was an emergency, that was the only way to rapidly add power generation. Even with the new terminals that were built with extraordinary speed, they had to deeply ration natural gas to the point that their manufacturing and chemical sectors, key drivers of their economy, are *still* in horrible shape 2 years later causing a recession in the country. Notably, Germany produced 10% less energy in 2023 than the year before. But the EU as a whole (including Germany) have *dramatically* ramped up investments in green energy as a result of the conflict, adding 40% more solar capacity in 2023 than in 2022 with Germany adding the lionshare of that. The dumbest thing Germany did was shutting down its nuclear reactors for no good reason, forcing them to import fossil fuels to make up for lost capacity.   >Because it was effectively signing away Europe's energy system to the whims of the US State Department and fossil fuel industry.  Again, this is extremely temporary the EU isn't going to suddenly and permanently be addicted to American gas. They're dramatically ramping up green energy production as we speak to reduce their reliance on foreign energy suppliers like the US.   >Accept that he either failed or actually never intended to take on climate in the way he promised, and move on.  So what exactly did you expect to happen? You say you didn't expect to see a huge drop in US oil production, and yet you're upset that production has increased under Biden and suggest that the US should cease all energy exports. Biden got the biggest investment in green energy passed (he was deeply personally invested and was the deciding factor in getting Manchin to sign on), but its going to take years for those investments to bear fruit. So Biden's been trying to keep energy prices from rising too high in the face of efforts by the Saudis and Russians to jack up costs all while making monumental investments in green energy. It's a balanced approach, which is literally what he campaigned on.   > It was naive to expect anything from Biden. But it's still important to accept that he failed to deliver on his promises.  Again, he specifically delivered on what he campaigned on. He managed to get the biggest green energy investment in history passed through a 50/50 Senate, despite one of the Dem Senators being a friggin coal magnate from West Virginia. Not sure what exactly you think Biden promised, but he very much accomplished what he promised, which was something few people even thought possible. Like your entire argument is essentially "if you ignore the IRA entirely, Biden has been horrible for the environment."

Yet this is what is often done for Islam. This is where I was drawing the comparison. I know its not reflective of Christianity and that was exactly my point. It's a questionable political and cultural movement that JUST SO HAPPENS to be in a majority Christian nation. I am asking for the same courtesy and logical soundness to be applied to Islam.   >A better comparison for your purposes might be pedophilia in the Catholic Church--just because it exists doesn't mean it should be attributed to Catholics  I was going to bring this up but felt it crass. But since you did I wholly agree and think what you say supports my point. Just because it exists (even if it's done by supposed religious leaders) doesn't mean it should be attributed to the religion. ANY religion.  On the female circumcision point.  1. It is not mentioned anywhere in the Quran. Which you must understand that as a Muslim we have a hierarchy when it comes to what we follow. First is the Quran which is the direct and perserved word of God. Next is the Sunna which is following the teachings of Mohammed PBUH through Hadith. There is also an extensive study and science surrounding authenticity of Hadiths to ensure that there are no fabrications.  2. Understanding this means that circumcision is not required at all for Muslims. It is Sunna and the very site you linked (which I wouldn't recommend as a primary source for further research because its a Q&A site) states (WARNING: PRIVATE PARTS MENTIONED):  "The type of female circumcision which is permitted in Islam entails cutting piece of the thin skin (prepuce) which is above the clitoris in a manner mentioned by the Prophet  ( ) i.e. without exaggeration. Therefore, the method of female circumcision does not entail cutting any part of the clitoris or labia nor does it involve infibulation (the practice of excising the clitoris and labia and stitching together the edges of the vulva to prevent sexual intercourse).  The method of female circumcision prescribed in the Shariah is akin to male circumcision in that only the prepuce is removed. The procedure of male circumcision entails the removal of the entire foreskin whereas in female circumcision only a piece of the prepuce is removed. Moreover, male circumcision is not considered barbaric rather it is encouraged by many western experts."  So its really not as bad as you make it out to seem. I wont deny that it is wrongfully practiced In some majority Muslim nations but it must be noted that the environments in which they are bieng practiced is in developing, wartorn, highly illiterate, or uneducated. In many Muslim states it is actually illegal because they know that those who often practice this are those most Likley to practice it wrongly.   >But what exactly has been "disproven"?

True. You did not say this explicitly. However it was implied through your selection of the afore-mentioned snappy anti-Islam headlines that you believe these are important points of the Islamic faith or else indicative of Islam as a religion and representative of Muslims in general which is not the case. Nevertheless, i apologise for my phrasing and would be happy to elaborate on the points you mentioned or refer you to some sources if you are genuinely interested in learning more about Islam.

The "government owning all companies" would be what is called state capitalism. Many socialist ideologies consider that to be a first step, but never the goal.   But private ownership of companies is objectively worse by any measure you look at. It means you're putting 99% of the people under the heel of the unelected and greediest 1%. It's why Americans can't afford their rent, or healthcare, or increasingly food. Because their apartments are privately owned by someone trying to gouge them as much as possible and their workplaces are privately owned by someone trying to pay them as little as possible.   Why would you prefer that over workplace democracy?

It's the sort of thing that works right up until it doesn't. If the guerilla force pushes the hegemon beyond the point of caring about civilian casualties or international condemnation, the guerilla force usually is extinguished.  And if the territory in which the guerilla force operates is constrained, their extinction becomes all the more difficult to avoid.  See: Fallujah.

Sometimes bailouts are necessary to keep America running. For example, if we didn't bail out airlines how would specialists get from hospital to hospital in time to save lives.  It is a hard truth to accept, but there are people who need it and there are people who don't, or at least shouldn't, but take it anyway. It screws everyone when people who could be working aren't.   And before you bring it up, yes, it is true that some people actually make more on benefits than they would with minimum wage. This is a huge part of the problem. More on this below.    Give exceptional tax breaks to the rich and almost none to everyone else.  Divisive politics played a part in getting rid of R&D write offs for companies and child tax credit payments. Both should exist but now neither do because of a childish inability to work together.   The problem in general isn't the tax system being rigged it's the fact that most people don't know anything about it and can't even file their own taxes much less form a business. It should be taught before you leave high school, and definitely have a much higher priority than any other elective or liberal art. If I had power I would make basic comprehension a requirement to graduate. Most successful people I speak with tell me this in one way or another, that this lack of education makes people feel like the system is rigged against them. It's not, it's literally the same laws for each and every person. Also, speaking as someone who runs two different businesses, a lot of those are necessary just to stay in business, at least for a small business, even in pre covid era. More on this below also.     Force everyone into for profit health plans and paying the highest prescription drug costs.  Healthcare in our country has never been done right. A lot of people like to point at Canada and say they want that, but they don't know people who literally died waiting to get treatment for an illness. I know some people don't have a choice in the matter but personally I wouldn't ever want a completely government run healthcare system. However, they should give you credit towards at least a basic plan and pay the same amount towards better ones as quality of care increases, at least if you are low income or have medical reasons.    Failure to embrace alternative energies in favor of fossil fuels.  This is 100% propaganda designed to manipulate people with no knowledge of our energy sector. It is true that Musk was on his way to eliminating our need for oil in regards to personal transportation BUT what people don't realize is that what matters is Diesel. You need oil to make diesel, and you need diesel for farming equipment. Biden's decision to not drill more oil only caused even more potentially war causing world hunger. Also, we are not going to need as much oil in 10-20 years when we switch to all electric cars. ( It may actually happen with actual automotive companies doing the R&D now and not cranking out cost inefficient vehicles) Even than, we will still need oil for diesel, but not as much of it. So in that context it makes sense to do as much drilling here and now so that we won't have to transport as much of it in the future (where things almost always go wrong is during transport and also incurs unnecessary costs, any competent environmentalist would know this.) So his plan doesn't really help the environment long term and definitely makes things tougher for us in the war with Russia over oil. We could be selling discounted oil to countries, taking business away from Putin, and limiting his ability to effectively wage war. There's just not a single train of logical thought behind any of his energy policies except "wahh oil bad let's get rid of it NOW".     Failure to support infrastructure needs.  True Republicans believe that the only way to solve inflation is to cut back on wasteful spending, stop printing more money, and have the government generally just do a lot less, funneling everything into our national debt. This would increase the value of our dollar, leading to a real solution to inflation and paying back people we owe money to instead of giving the people we took loans from free money. I don't get how people don't get this. Democratic cities are always the most poorly run financially speaking and people can't wait to get away from Cali and NY this year.     I could go on...  I will to, this is the aforementioned below I referenced earlier.  So the solution as I see it as a progressive Republican is not getting rid of big business but simply giving more benefits to being a small one. If you want to see real change and a big chunk of that 2% money changing hands than you need to give these huge entities someone they can realistically have a competition with.   One of the few things Trump did that I liked, (calling out career politicians was my personal favorite), was empowering small business so it could actually compete. I would have loved to see a continuation of this philosophy! We could have maybe made it so that the top 5% valued of corporations lose all tax write offs except for things like Medical research, Technology, and things in general meant to advance our species. They could still chase that title of being the richest but would have to contribute meaningfully to society to do it. At the same time bottom 5% don't pay any taxes! Also, your first entity is free and there is a government sponsored program explaining the basics of business, taxes, etc. and maybe a favorable gov loan to get you started.   That would actually make the oligarchy blink because with hard work regular people could finally achieve the American dream within their lifetimes again. Anyone who doesn't have a disability (SS is now just for sick people who can't work for a medical reason) automatically gets to start their own business, with education, tools, etc. included at first instead of just giving away money for free. Uncle Sam will love this too because at the end of the day they get payed at least three different ways when a corporation puts in the hard work, further strengthening our dollar. It will be hard for him not to come out ahead even if a large percentage of these companies fail. Win - Win for everyone     I do not see any policies from the GOP that are not self serving Corporate give-aways.  What have dems done with complete control of our government to actually help people? They have (had) all the power so realistically they could have done anything. I just see SS getting cut, no Student loan forgiveness, among other things. Basically any reason I would want to support him he dragged his heels for two years on, didn't pass it but passed things like IRS audits designed to target low income Americans, and will still somehow blame GOP for his inaction to do the things he promised his voters he would do.   I think we need to accept that both are flawed but not be so quick to throw away the things each does really well.

It is kind of unfair to people who rent or to people who chose to live in hurricane free regions or who hurricane proof their properties. If we analyze federal taxes flow in and out of states, we see that some states are net beneficiaries and some are net contributors. There is all sort of disagreement on fairness. I generally see people are more prejudiced against student loan holders than other groups who receive reliefs. I really hate that.

A truly based libertarian philosophy isn't pro capitalism or pro socialism; it's pro freedom and liberty.  Recognizing that slaves where bought and sold in a capitalistic market owned as private property, a libertarian should reject the parts of capitalism that allow people to subject others against their will.  Whether that be through true slavery backed by the collective system in play or wage slavery and ignorance slavery that is prominent the world over today.  There is no argument for "the original owner" of natural resources that doesn't include violent use of force for exclusion of the rest of humanity from those resources.

Ultimately I agree that most Libertarians today are fringe republican crazy people that don't understand the value or function of government.  Instead of being pro freedom and liberty they often are simply anti-government.  Removing government doesn't remove conflict between people and groups of people; it increases them and decreases realized liberty and freedom.

And this is just pertaining to this particular conflict.  There are more UN resolutions against Israel than Russia, Iran, China and Syria combined, how can one say they aren't biased and wonder if there is something fishy going on (as evidenced by the recent case of EU officials being bribed by Qatar, there is).

Companies wanting illegal work IS wrong, and its the reason for high illegal immigration. But companies NEED that illegal immigration, so it stays the way it is. If we went hard on companies who hired them, and reduced the demand, the supply would also decrease. But it never will. Because corporations run our government, and they do not want that endless supply of cheap labor that they do not have to pay taxes or healthcare on to end.   So they let the people in charge pretend to care, while making sure the laws dont change, and they laugh at us complain about it all the way to the bank.

Im so tired of this group picking and choosing when they want to follow and invoke international law. They claim its super important as soon as they see Israel do something wrong but when it comes to things like the Houthis attacking civilian vessels many of them ignore it and deflect back to Israel being the bigger issue. Another example would be international law allowing you to wage war against cites normally considered protected if its being used militarily. Ive seen people go just because its international law doesnt mean its morally right.   I agree with that statement international law isnt the end all be all however the standards must be evenly applied across the board. You cannot pick and choose when you want to follow international law simply because it benefits what you agree with.

If the farm was moved further away you begin to have loss,  which would then increase the size of the solar farm needed.    Plus you would need storage for that power, the city still needs to run at night.  Thats going to take a few more square miles.   Large solar farms increase local temperatures by 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius.     Now imagine every big city across the country doing that.   We dont have the resources to create that in 10 years.

By the end of 2025 there most likely wont be any Palestinians left in the area formerly known as Gaza or Israel. Towards the end of 2025 the West Bank will start getting exterminated. By the end of 2026, Israel would have claimed Gaza & the West Bank and property developers would be doing additional roadshows hawking newly built settlements. Is that what they want?  No, of course not.   Well, if Biden loses, Trump wins. That means the US will continue to veto anything at the UN no matter what the Israelis do & probably fight any foreign nation that tries to intervene.

As the remaining oil and gas becomes harder and harder to extract, absolutely everything will become more expensive. Especially food, as when using natural gas for the Haber-Bosch process to make nitrates becomes economically unfeasible then the alternatives, for example Haber-Bosch with hydrogen from electrolysis or nitrates from atmospheric nitrogen using plasma arc, will cost about 10 times as much in energy for the same fertiliser. Even if fusion power comes online I think it will take a long time for energy to be as cheap as it has been.

Often the response to "why doesn't UN do anything about X but only haunts Israel", is because they don't have jurisdiction on these actors.  Equally often people just aren't up to date what sort of decisions and rulings UN and ICJ or ICC do.   > You could even say that of Ukraine. That's a conflict where about 100k civilians were killed by Russia, mostly in the East of the country and the media attention is not as much as for Gaza.  UN and ICJ have made multiple rulings and decisions against Russia; ICC has an arrest warrant out for Putin. We're now almost 2 years into the invasion, and most major newspapers at least in Europe still have live coverage of the conflict.    > Syria?   ICJ ruled against Syria just in November, for Crimes against Humanity. However, in Syrian war there were loads of non-governmental parties to the war, and Syria isn't an ICC member, so there's not jurisdiction to do much.   > In Sudan - nobody cares   Former Sudan's president Omar Al Bashir is wanted by ICC. But Sudan also isn't part of ICC, so again, jurisdiction issues. I agree that there should be more Western media attention on Sudan defo. But it's a bit inevitable, that Israel hits more home for the Western sphere.  > Mayanmar   There was just a massive genocide case in the ICJ against Myanmar - SA cited it a lot in its case against Israel - and generally countless of UN decisions and investigations into the situation.

We should be intermixing these singular means of sourcing crops to a more closed loop eco system. For example: after an orchard harvest instead of leaving the unworthy fruits on the ground which can encourage disease/blight/pests, allow pigs to roam and eat all the leftover apples that would be waste or a potential problem. This would feed pigs and increase fruit yields while reducing waste and fertilizing the soil (pig poop). Overall I believe this should mean more intentional farming practices that see a farm as a natural system and not land to produce a commodity.

Not all of it - major part of it is how natural "design" of humans and world is actually influencing humans to commit moral evil. After all if we assume existence of God, then the reason why humans are able to be under mental duress or be affected by outside stimuli to the point of having their judgement clouded is that it is how God designed humans to be. Not to mention that inherent human traits of aggression and tribalism are also part of "design".  So how a Free Will Defense would work in defending God if by his own design he created humans to be able to have their free will tampered with or overwritten without specific influence of other humans?  That is the main issue of justifying moral evil via free will. If God is to be absolved from earthly moral evil, he would need to not be inherently tangled into it. But by creating humans in a way that makes them prone to this influence this completely contradicts the usual image of all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good God. For God to exist under those circumstances he must be either lack power, lack knowledge or not be perfectly good.  As to your edit:  >My response is that we as humans currently have the maximum possible free will, proven by the existence of evil.  What is evil and from where it comes? You may try to again dismiss this as natural evil, but you could only dismiss it if there would be no connection between natural evil and moral evil. But they are deeply intertwined and as such explanation of moral evil via free will choices cannot be suitable in a world where natural evil exists and influences people's choices. For that it needs to be part of God's design - then how we can excuse moral evil if God designed reality in a way that will try to influence you to commit evil?

I am very much *not* intending to debate the merits of Israel as war criminal or not.  The only thing Im saying is that if Israel keeps getting pushed to stop the offensive then Hamas wins. Not because of military capability but because they are willing to sacrifice their people by the bucket load so long as it can be pinned on Israel.  And thats the problem, Hamas chooses to fight in the bloodiest and cruelest way possible, and then cries when Israel chooses to fight back on their terms. And it has to be on their terms. If it is not then youll lose. If you chose to take the high road, Hamas will continue to hide behind civilians and Israel would just have to take the shots.

On top of that there is the whole decision process. Also, nuclear is far more expensive than wind and solar, but money can't be the object here.

For the past 4 decades both have been neoliberal capitalist. The US (and most Western countries) is an oligopoly, in which a bunch of corporations (the oligarchy) have immense influence over the government, whether reps or dems are in charge, and they pass laws conducive to their own agenda. The purpose of presidents and high ranking officials is to give the illusion of democracy, and create a superficial and fake finger pointing in public but holding hands behind the back public fight between dems and reps to give the illusion of democracy. The democrats use virtue signalling but they don't actually do anything for the 99%. The republicans tell the democracts to stop being "woke" but they themselves also don't do anything for the 99%. Both answer to the 1%.   They put corporations ahead of everyone, including trans people. They bizarrely claim that trans people cannot economically suffer: this is not true, trans people do suffer economically, and this is due to both dems and reps policies. If they were actually pro trans or minority, they would stop economically bending over for the corporations who run the country. But instead they want to divide people on gender/race/religion, etc... so people do not unite and focus their attention on the oligarchy, which is the root source of everyone's problems.  In order to distract people, first they preoccupied everyone with the fear of the "other", that is, soviet nukes, and then the war on terror, and now that they ran out of ways to distract people, they brought that show man Trump and caused a fake silly dem vs rep fight and increased polarization, when paradoxically the 2 parties are 2 sides of the same coin. And the whole time their disgusting environment damaging and health damaging consumer culture also kept people ignorant and preoccupied. After the Occupy Wall Street protests, they got scared and got Goldman Sachs speech giving bank bailing Obama to push "wokeism" to divide and conquer dems and reps so people would stop focusing on how both dems and reps answer to the 1% ahead of the 99% regardless of straight or trans, black or white, etc... then they continued this polarization and divide+conquer game by selecting that showman TV personality as the republican front-runner.

In winter nights, you must have some way to provide 70-80GW. The amount will only increase a lot in the future due to the phasing out of fossil for heating, and the transition to electrical cars amongst others uses.  If there is not much or no wind at all, like it happened for weeks in 2021 and 2022 in **most of the Europe at the same time**, and which **will happen more often in the future due to climate change**, there you must provide this amount by another way.  You either have enough storage for hundreds of GWh of electricity and a power output from 70GW to several hundreds of GW, which is science-fiction right now and may never be feasible, or you have backup : hydro/coal/gas/nuclear.  There is no escape to this. Germany has not much hydro, and want to phase out of coal, gas and nuclear, then it's betting its whole energy policy on the hope that maybe we will find some way to store a lot of electricity. Alert spoiler : they will never phase out gas entirely, or will turn to nuclear at some point.  > For France I am curious how french people will solve the financial challenges the french power policy brings with.  The whole nuclear current fleet has never been paid by taxpayers. Entirely on EDF's own funds, and with borrowings on public markets. Nuclear plants pay for themselves.  EDF makes billions in net profits every year, 10 billion in the first half of 2023 alone. The anti-nuclear crowd never stops spouting rubbish about nuclear power, and the legend of subsidised French nuclear power is one of them, but it's just not true.  Germany, on the other hand, spends billions on real subsidies for renewables, and that doesn't make them question themselves.  > In 2022 lectricit de France was in deep debt, with total liabilities of 341 billion EUR:  First thing, you don't know what you're reading, the EDF's debt is at 67 billions of euros, not 341.  Secondly, the French government has imposed the ARENH on EDF which forces them to sell at a loss to their competitors, has put the cost of the Bouclier Fiscal on EDF which forced them to sell at a loss to their customers, and this while the European market makes us pay the price of gas-made electricity (and thus the price of war in Ukraine and the dependence of Germany on Russia) even if we use very little.   Look into the matter, EDF's debt is not due to the cost of nuclear power, but to legislation. EDF has been making billions of euros in net profits every year for decades, even though its main activity (40-50%) is nuclear power, and has made 10 billion euros in 6 months since France removed some of these legislation.    I already debunked the rest of your comment in this answer or the other, I won't come back to it.

White Supremacists have really good message discipline, so when there is public outcry against "Israel", white supremacists are good at making an "Israel"=Jews conflation in an attempt to slip antisemitic rhetoric into normal anti-Zionism. Or they might abuse real situations to introduce anti-semitic tropes. For example, AIPAC has an outlandish amount of political sway in the US. White Supremacists try to paint this as some kind of "Zionist Occupied Government" conspiracy. Or taking "Israeli" propaganda efforts and using that make claims about "Jewish control of the global media" or some such.  On the other side, you also have many Zionists that try to conflate "Israel" and Jewish people/Judaism. When they do this, any kind of criticism of the "Israeli" terror regime becomes directly anti-semitic.  And, as you mention in your conclusion, there is the bizarre corner case of antisemites who are Zionists. I guess I probably shouldn't call it a "corner case", there are more Christian Zionists in the US than there are Jews in the entire world, and almost all Christian Zionism is pretty anti-semitic at it's root. But white supremacists have been known to praise "Israel's" ethno-state, even if they hate Jewish people

When you decrease the temperature gradient (i.e. when temperatures are more uniform), you get less air movement. Low (and high) pressure systems are the result of pressure gradient, temperature gradient, and the coriolis effect interacting with air masses in such a way that gets em spinning. You also have to consider different layers of the atmosphere moving in different ways (higher up in the atmosphere, air moves more freely and much faster, towards the earths surface its slower and gets messed with a lot by friction). You also ALSO have to consider the interaction between ocean water (in this case, warming up) and the air above it (the ocean and our atmosphere are very connected).   Storms getting more extreme could be the result of runaway feedback loops. This is more easily understood in terms of warmer storms (like hurricanes, which are basically wet and powerful ocean low-pressure systems); since the water is warmer and the air is warmer (and can thus hold more water) and the vertical temperature gradient is weaker (reducing shear), you kind of create a recipe for a nastier storm. Bear in mind though that hurricanes are finicky; if the water is TOO warm and the temp/pressure gradients are TOO weak, they wont form.   Another thing that melting ice caps and warming climate do is SHIFT atmospheric streams (if you will) in such a way that brings different kinds of weather to different areas that may not have occurred before.  Its almost kind of like a butterfly affect ha. When you change the global temp even just a little, theres a whole cascade of changes that can and will occur in the atmosphere and in the ocean.  Hopefully that kind of gives you some context even if it doesnt answer your question super well.  Edit: typos

First, there is a necessary sense of cooperation between the church and civil society because of the fact that in a sense, the church is simply an institution like any other, and like all institutions is composed of people who have particular values and thus transmit those values through the institution to society. And peoples values, in turn, are shaped by the values of society. Thus, the Churchs values and social message can inspire hearts and vivify other institutions when it is institutionally strong, and conversely if societys values are opposed to the church, its institutional significance and strength will decline. In this sense, acting as if the church and state can be totally independent is simply impossible. Since freedom is not a good in itself, but truth and Justice are, it follows that the state must protect truth and Justice over and above freedom, since there is no independence and the State can actively prune the cultural values embodied within a particular political community.  Second, it is a falsehood because there are clear cases of conflict. In the same way that I may choose to abstain from eating ice cream for breakfast regularlyand I would be a liar if I said that I have never eaten ice cream for breakfastbecause I perceive it is a higher good to pursue physical health, the church must actively oppose governments which promote sin and vice in the name of the common good. In the same way that having ice cream for breakfast in one instance is not ruinous to my physical health, yet making it a habit means I now must actively subordinate the good of ice cream to the higher good of physical health, the Church doesnt need to intervene unless the state is actively promoting vice. This is to say that the common good is a good *in itself*, but not the highest good and certainly not the object of human life or existence.  Does that make sense? I have a habit of rambling and incoherence.

Also try to dismantle Iranian influence one at a time primarily with Hizbullah who sits on the Israeli border if possible and there might be little consequences for it even bomb a few targets in mainland Iran itself.  Since scenario 2 appears to be the case i woould say Israel pulling out troops from Gaza is more then likely them preparing for an invasion of Lebanon on some level which begs the obvious question **will Iran strike again if Israel does a full out invasion of Lebanon**

Medicaid is a state-federal partnership that provides services to the poor, pregnant and elderly.  Specifically, Medicaid will pay for nursing home care or home and community based waiver services so senior citizens can stay in their homes.

(Its been awhile since I read some of the summaries. But I think I remember something about medicating or overmedicating.)  Section 1983 is a portion of US Code where a person can sue a state officer for a violation of their rights.  Excessive force complaints can be sec. 1983 actions.    The question here is whether the plaintiff had a right to sue the state agency under Sec. 1983 when there are other ways to appeal the decision and the law is a spending clause situation between Congress and the states.  Worse case scenario is the states pull a no one qualifies, we are keeping the money deal where instead of providing care, the Medicaid funds go into the general fund.

When we talk about other emergencies, we talk about hope and optimism in terms of recovering from the damage but the damage itself is undeniable.   The problem facing climate policy and a livable future isn't people losing hope, it's that virtually no one understands the scale of the emergency or that their behavior is the emergency that needs to be fixed. That, if we figure out how to stabilize the climate, it will be by unliving the lives of a couple generations; investing energy and work into unmaking the decisions that led to the atmospheres chemistry being changed in the first place which will take at least the same amount of energy as we extracted from it as work when we burned it.  This is the last moment we have to do anything of any consequence and that action looks like voting in a universal carbon tax that is pegged to whatever it currently costs to pull carbon out of the air, which will change as energy becomes more expensive to produce. When we get it right, burning oil should be so expensive we only do it if there's no other option, which we should be doing to avoid extinction already, but people don't actually believe that's the path they're on because this message has always been delivered with cookies and milk.  You don't hear "everything is on fire! But, don't worry, people are protesting the fire and there are lots of anti-fire groups to join. The new ministry of fires is working on a way to cut fires back by 10% in 5 years, so don't give up hope!" Why? Because emergencies don't need a message tacked on to make them palatable, they need clear and accurate descriptions of what is, so people can make decisions based in reality rather than delusion.  Giving someone hope when their house is burning down can be good, if that hope comes with the condition that they exit the burning building or put the fire out. But if youre telling people it isn't as on fire as it seems, you're trapping them in a false hope they will cling to. That's what "green" manufacturing is. We've been talking about it for decades and have actually started to move on it and our emissions are at a record high.   Hope is the reward for changing the behavior that's causing the emergency. You can hope all you want that a fire will put itself out, but, more often than not, it consumes everything and spreads. We don't have the time for this.  Flip the lights on; party's over. We partied so hard we burned the house down. It's what we choose next that decides whether we die in the fire or live doing something completely different but whatever we're doing now, MUST stop.   It's an emergency. It's simple. How people react is not the most important part of how this is communicated. The most important part is that it is communicated that there is no hope without changing everything we do and the reasons we do anything.   Yelling "FIRE!" in a crowded theater is unacceptable under all but the singular circumstance that every effort has been made to get people out of the building, that it is on fire, and that they refuse to leave. In that case, yelling "FIRE!" isn't doomerism, it is an accurate and appropriate message that the people in the theater deserve to understand. There will be a stampede and people will get trampled but some will also get out which is better than our current trajectory where nothing gets out, and our efforts are spent trying to explain why we shouldn't yell "fire!".   Stop wringing your hands and be truthful and accurate with the state of things. We are currently doomed and if we want to change that, everything need to change and be devoted to avoiding this impending inevitability.   If it were a developing country that was doing this to us, we would nuke them and save ourselves. Because we're the one's that are doing it, we need to workshop how to deliver the message that we're killing ourselves AND the planet?   That's how we stay on this path an watch the world go silent before we starve. This is the worst possible path to be on no matter what color it is or if it runs on batteries or fuel. The only thing we've accomplished since WWII "ended" is proving that humans can either be limited to the pace of existence or drive existence into the ground. That's all of it. What we've seen vanishes with us. Our only legacy is the cost of our actions, and our only action has been setting fuel on fire at every opportunity.

My understanding is that though Christian democracy is really pro property rights, these property rights need to fulfill certain duties/conditions. There was an Argument by Wilhelm von Ketteler that said that property is good but Capitalism has badly misunderstood property and Communism has resulted because of that misunderstanding.  An example I read elsewhere was with interest and capital. There is a strong argument to be made that being a 'Capitalist', where ones income is solely from capital, is inherently wrong. Christian Democracy seems to favor income from Labour, Because labour is, by nature, productive. From this, the purpose of Interest and of dividends is to remunerate the forgoing of personally earned wealth. However, if ones income is solely from Capital, then it undermines the premise. Because then the  remuneration is not towards 'forgoing wealth' but towards 'not investing my wealth elsewhere'.   Where am I going with this? Everyone should privately own a home. But not all forms of home ownership are justified. Basically I think many forms of investment properties are unjust and contradictory to the purpose of home ownership. I think policies towards ensuring the right purpose of Home ownership will also help ensure all people get a home.

No. And that's the difference...prosecuting Trump is being done within the law because there is evidence he broke the law (and not just minor laws, like storing emails on a personal server, but literally stealing and keeping top secret documents as a civilian, planning a coup, defrauding the state and more).   &#x200B;  >This post is a prediction, one that I feel many Trump supporters are either ignoring or they want it to happen.

They did NOT grant that immunity to the president under Art. II at any point. This is a simple case. And SCOTUS already knows how it is going to rule. My guess is that they believe an authoritative, well developed, historically grounded decision is necessary to put this matter to rest, and took the case on that basis.

One former Justice official told the Post, "You couldnt use the T word.*  *The Post quoted a person familiar with internal DOJ discussions who felt as though the department was reacting to the House committees work as well as heightened media coverage and commentary, drawing attention to the scheme.* ***Only after they were embarrassed did they start looking, the person said.***   Garland is basically an institutionalist, that means he puts protecting his institutional power ahead of all other concerns.    Its more important to him to do what's best for the DOJ than it is to do what's best for the country.    Its the same for most heads of government agencies, Comey wasn't much different.

NOAA has tide guages every few miles along the US coastline.  If you live within driving distance, you can go see one yourself and take a measurement at a +0 tide on a calm day.  I live on the coast, so it's pretty easy to stick a yardstick down my sea wall at mid tide.  I've measured 40mm in the last 50 years. (1.5 inches).

A very  minor amount is "medium impact" that is radioactive for a day or two.  By the time it would be stored, it's no longer a concern.  A very tiny amount of nuclear waste is the material that would be radioactive for years, even a few thousand years.  It could be used to provide heat in the winter for homes, provide industrial heat, etc. if we were more rational about the actual dangers of very low levels of radiation. Instead we consider anything that has been anywhere near a nuclear reactor to be nearly instantly fatal to everyone and we panic about "where are we going to store this deadly material for thousands of years?"

Though I kind of agree with your overall point.  I'm pretty left wing, but first and foremost I consider myself of student of history and political science. So I always try to use History to inform my opinions first, sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it doesn't. I'm not   First, I think your post is very much within the context of American politics, or at the very least kind of the post-colonial western world. I caution people to avoid viewing it within this context. There are many people who although are aware of conflicts between rich and poor, and white supremacy, there are many parts of the world (and even the U.S.) in which they have no direct personal experience (that they are aware of) with these issues. It is not on the top of their mind at all, the left in those areas may very well have entirely different motivations. Because of this, I would say much of your argument is a historical/logical fallacy. The left in the U.S. is currently very sympathetic with the foreign poor first and foremost, and are following their lead consciously or not.  All other observations on the behavior of the left should be taken with a grain of salt.   Second, I have said this before, I do not think we should underestimate how ill informed many are on this conflict and region. I can speak as an American, most American's are not educated on the history of Jews, Arabs, Judaism, Islam, Israel or the middle east. Most Americans may study the holocaust in middle or high school for a week or two, and there may be a comparable amount of time spent on conflicts in the Arab world/Middle east in general. It may be more or less depending on your region, but that is it. In college there may be a required "world history", or "relgions/philosophy" class that may cover some of this, but not much more. Even as a History and Political Science major, I did not have to study any of this.    Third, I've been very concerned at the lack of empathy for any group (good or bad) in this conflict. I would like to make clear that I do not confuse sympathy with empathy, you can have empathy but still think someone is evil and wrong,  but I think if we are not making a conscious effort to understand where others are coming from, both friend or foe, it will be very hard to dismantle the systems that have essentially created this conflict. Speaking from what I've seen in America, the left needs to make a more conscious effort understanding the generational trauma Jews have after enduring generations of persecution and genocide through out the world. The right needs to do a better job realizing what issues have led groups like Hamas towards extremist Islam.   Finally, I maintain, this war has been lost by Israel and Hamas. No one has stepped up with the courage to power through to a permanent solution. Neither will control the outcome of this conflict in the long run, at some point, maybe years from now, the international community will have to step in and control the situation. When this happens it will permanently change Israel and Palestine, I'm sure they will exist, but they very well may no longer have the autonomy they seek either de-facto or dejure. I would argue this is happening to an extent already, but that is probably a bigger discussion.

My goal has always been to have that handshake between Israel and Palestine.

Plants grow and take up CO2. Then die and give of the CO2.  If you burn it, digest it, compost it, ferment it or let it decompose in a landfill doesn't matter. Microorganisms will eat it all and convert the biomass back into CO2 and water.  It might matter if you make some of it into methane instead of CO2. Methane is a stronger greenhouse gas than CO2. But if you ferment poop and make methane, you can call this BioGas and use it as fuel, replacing petrol or diesel. Good for the climate. Very good!  There are some simple ways to long-term sequester (some of) the carbon in biomass.  Heat it up and convert it into pure carbon. Bio-char. Great for soil improvement. Lasts thousands of years. You can use the volatile gases produced to run the process and/or generate electricity.  Let living biomass grow in volume and store carbon in the biomass. Trees typically. But also algae.  Or use the biomass as natural fertilizer, increasing the carbon content of soils. Making soils thicker and more fertile and also less sensitive to (short) droughts. Typically you also need to use non-till and non-plough farming. The carbon is then stored, and move back and forth in biological processes between, microorganisms and worms, decomposing biomass, plant roots and ground cover. Over (long) time soils can grow many meters thick sequestering large amounts of carbon. But if you disturb them, start deep ploughing them every year, they will shrink. Giving off the carbon stored in them as CO2 and methane.  Sometimes dead algae and other organisms may sink to the bottom of the ocean, before the carbon has decomposed. And be buried under sediment for a long time.   In cold regions permafrost may freeze biomass preserving it for thousands of years. Every summer a new layer of biomass grow on top. And press down past layer to the frozen layers beneath. Permafrost store huge amounts of carbon this way. And global warming start to thaw them now...   The fossil carbon in coal and oil comes from a distant past when there were no microorganisms that could digest and live from plant matter. So it just accumulated in thick layers. Eventually some bacteria and fungi figured out how to use all that biomass as food.  And then the rapid carbon cycle started.  Nature always finds a way...

There was a person who worked for the entire park system who built an IPM program, trained workers in following it, and managed building an invasive plants control system. (including eradicating cultivated invasives from the parks and gardens).   Nowadays this is far more common. There are gardens around all the Smithsonian buildings on the National mall. Many of them are themed and provide environmental information - for instance, next to the Natural History Museum there is a pollinators garden, another large garden that wraps around the whole section and shows native plants of the region used as landscaping, with explanations of their importance in the ecosystem.

US Presidents have almost *never* been the friends of us working class people who are being exploited every day.   I think it's nearly inarguable that Biden has done all these things. Where they're possibly justified is another question. History shows us that liberals (and "Conservatives") of all stripes in office will eventually side with the fascists when things get really bad. They will justify their actions every sort of way. The different capitalist parties in Nazi Germany never saw reason to overthrow Hitler. Henry Ford and nearly every other industry titan monsters cheered on Hitler and his means.

To me there are two main ones, the rest is about organizing it and keeping it going: 1. Ecologically + socially regenerative and environmentally (like imagine Bitcoin mining but for actually solving real environmental issues) + socially indexed (like time banks) currencies, basically using something like the ISEW or World Happiness Index as indicators for economic performance and currency value  2. Corporations and industries that are incentivized to optimize and improve shareholder value (rather than just stakeholder profit), and include the environment as a "shareholder"   3. Governments with influence, OR at least a critical mass of networks with people that are really compelled to use these systems  4. For feasibility's and resilience sake, dual global/regionalized (a quasi-federated sort of system for sustaining critical mass and the impact at scale) and localized (for visceral practical local purposes, bartering, and local resilience with integrity to the actual environment there) economies  .......  Sidestepping all the socioeconomic/political "ism" jargon that's likely to emerge in other comments (though I'd offer Regenerative economy concepts--where much of an economy is anchored not just by circular recycling/upchucking but actually restoring and upholding generative ecological cycles as the key underpinning focus) and super grand "what if the entire US government selected Bernie Sanders who also brought on a really Green Party or Indigenous nations for a super rad new economy?" sort of trajectory into something that's probably a bit more feasible:  I'm convinced it would have to tie the value of the currency and economy to the quality and health of the environment and community in the region as a way to reflect and incentivize economic activity that actually takes care of the environment. e.g. watershed quality, local air quality, native and naturalized biodiversity etc., Localized renewable energy production capacity and ownership and energy demand drawdown.   It also should take care of public needs rather than reward speculative and useless accumulation of interest and meaningless financial transactions the way a lot of currency and other wallstreet trading does.   And it should also incentivize people getting out to interact with and take care of each other. This last part is something that time banks/time dollars actually do: the idea that everyone has time and they have some kind of ability to perform services and barter.   So if you cut someone's grass for an hour, that's worth a time dollar which you could use to get someone else to babysit for you or pick up groceries or whatever feels like a fair equivalent. But the other key here is that it's generative. You can get money even if nobody has money to pay with by doing with your time something that's valuable to them and put it on the record of your time bank. There's a handful of places that actually do this.  Think about how Bitcoin rewards computation and more or less can't be faked because of the Blockchain which gives it resilience as a currency compared to how the US federal reserve dollar which just depends on what the Federal Reserve declares as the current interest rate and value of a currency because they sort of feel like it, and a web of other financial institutions which also run a lot of the world's banks like the IMF agree or tied themselves to it also.   My issue with the federal reserve system and current way US dollars are valued is that it is basically limited to austerity regulatory mechanisms (print more or less money/change the interest rates and defined value of currency, that's it) which all runs on a sort of ponzi (in the sense that we plug with the fiat of their statements by trusting in cash just because a bunch of financial institutions use and agree on it.  But you will always have to take something from somewhere in order to gain)  because austerity controls can't accommodate for other forms economic value that are happening (like volunteership and ecosystem services).   So US fiat system money sort of runs on a Ponzi scheme that magically ends with trusting the Federal reserve and keeps itself running because a lot of other institutions believe in it, yet when people volunteer to do something, or when say a wetland pretreats water quality, or the oceans are already sequestering carbon in ways that people and nations actually do value, none of that gets accounted for (even though economists like Robert Costanza want to account for it all, it's not really common practice).   And you still have to take money from somewhere or someone in order to get it--it's exploitative by nature because you always have to take from someone else and can't actually create anything unless the demigods at the Federal Reserve, World Bank, and IMF decide they'll do something about how money circulates in the world and how much it's worth.   Whereas a bitcoin at least offers a way for people to get value by participating in their calculation process and get rewarded, but honestly whatever those calculations/Blockchain problems are they seem pretty useless if not harmful to the environment and don't do much for promoting better social behavior among us. So imagine if instead, the value of a currency went up whenever your local wolf population became stable, the water was drinkable, and people were actively taking care of their communities in ways that were being measured.  In the US it's possible and legal to set up local currencies, but probably challenging to set up a local currency that indexes value to things like how off grid and energy+environmentally resilient a community/regional economy is.     Plus corporations need a broader diversity of priorities to shift away from maximizing shareholder value/general capitalism that maximizes wealth extraction to maximizing or at least optimizing how they generate shareholder and ecosystemic value/improvements.  And businesses could be functioning more like a network with common environmental/sustainability/resilience and community benefit agreement priorities as best practices in their contracting/way of business.  We do have B-Corps, L3Cs and various "Social Enterprises"/Restorative Enterprises (e.g. companies that clean up and upcycle trash into products, it's extractive in a way but for clean up purposes) and some regenerative enterprises (think of non GMO farming/seed companies that work with actual harvest cycles and also generate habitats).   But very few of them are putting pressure on other companies with their contracting agreements to use environmental best practices and pursue ghg reduction goals. Most of the time the top priority for any business leader is to just survive (or eventually grow) as a business.  .  Critical mass For both of the above processes you kind of have to start things up like you're starting a bank or at least have a strong coalition of organizations to ensure people willing to use the system and work together towards common goals.  You probably need more than just a city. Existing time banks and local currencies like the Ithica Hours probably proves that local stuff can work, but it's a lot of work. But if you have a specific industry coalition that benefits from this or at least a whole region of folks figuring out environmental projects, this is probably going to work a bit more smoothly rather than having just one tiny nonprofit organization chase after all the people in a neighborhood trying to get them on board.  And you guard against recessions better this way too because locally people can still barter or do other things even when the federal/macro picture of economics might not be doing so well.

Think about how daunting it was to create the system of gas stations we have today.   110 years ago we had a bunch of cars being built and only a few gas stations.  Today we have over 110,000 stations in the US.  Trucks running 24/7 going from terminals to each and every one of those stations, often daily and we don't even think about it.     It will take time, there may some bumps in the road, but if most electric companies know they will be increasing income by 20%, they can spend some money to prepare the grid for what is coming.

I have two legitimate options and any vote that isn't for either of those two is a vote for person who ends up winning. This applies to all states. A vote for Miriam Williamson maths out to a vote that could have been used to stop fascism but instead was used as a protest.  It's not a genocide. Words have meaning. It's an urban war where the civilian death toll is significantly less than the United States recent conflicts. If people are against genocide they should do what they can to ensure someone who actually pines for genocide isn't placed in office. Unfortunately that level of deep "two step" thinking is hard for too many Americans... Go ahead and throw your vote out. I'm certain a fully conservative supreme Court for the rest of our lives will be worth the protest. I'm sure never getting a liberal president again will be worth it...  Both candidates don't support genocide. You are comparing apples and something that isn't even a fruit. One candidate has been attempting to temper Israel and one candidate wants to know how fast we can nuke the region... You aren't being serious and you aren't thinking logically about what's next if Trump wins.   "I think this thing is really bad. It has the ability to be 100X worse. But instead of thinking about that I'm going to say all bad things are equal. Now that all bad things are equal I must vote for a third party candidate propped up for and paid by right wing billionaires because they are going to stop the war perpetrated by Hamas. That will certainly change things in the direction I want them to!"  We have a first past the post voting system that all but ensures a two party system. I would love to rank choice vote, but that's not what we have. In reality you have the choice of the two candidates, Trump and Biden; Who do you think is going to lead our country better?  I'm going with Biden over the child rapist who idolizes Hitler... But like you do you.  Edit: words

I support the existence of Israel as a Jewish state and their right to self-defense. I also support Palestinian self-determination. Long term, this conflict can only be resolved through a political compromise and some sort of phased 2 state solution. Hamas is the antithesis of such a compromise. Their very existence is in opposition to any kind of peaceful resolution. Israel has had a hand to play here too and have definitely pursued policies that have been impediments to peace. In the current hostilities, Israel should be held to account to do everything reasonable to protect civilians and address the humanitarian needs of Gazans. That said, after 10/7, I believe they are more than justified in wanting to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas.

They wont make it IMPOSSIBLE to be accused and have your life ruined. Nothing is impossible. Just like you could be shot walking down the sidewalk tomorrow, or the Earth could get sucked into a wormhole idk.   1. Dont commit rape. This technically doesnt protect you from false allegations, but it does protect you from true allegations, which make up the vast majority of allegations.   2. Dont associate with people you dont trust. Dont have sex with them. Dont hang out alone with them. If youre never alone with a person, there will always be at least one other person who could corroborate your story. This makes any allegations less credible and less likely to even be made for that reason.   3. Get yourself a strong social and professional circle of people who trust you. People who will trust you when you say no I didnt do that   4. Have an alibi. This will make it easy to refute any claims made against you.   5. Be a movie star or famous athlete. Or be really popular for something else. Sure youll lose some fans but you had a lot to begin with.   As far as the actual trial goes, the burden of proof is usually higher than most actually credible rape claims can provide, so youre PROBABLY good there. Most people are more worried about the social repercussions anyway.   Rape is a weird splotch on our justice system. It is a terrible terrible thing that can be done pretty easily with no evidence, and that just sucks really. Many more men and women will be raped than will be falsely accused. Theres a delicate balance between how seriously to take these allegations as a society, since we dont want there to be no consequences for actually doing the crime, but we also dont want to give people too much power to lie about it.

My reason for dooming is because in Putin's interview with Tucker Carlson Putin decided to go into depth for some reason about 11th century prince Yaroslav the Wise. As everyone who is familiar with Wisconsinites and Michiganders knows the legacy of Yaraslov the Wise is the single most important factor governing midwestern elections. As far as I know Biden has not mentioned the legacy of Yaraslov the Wise once so how can we expect him to win reelection if he won't even talk about the issue that's most important to real American voters?

They're long dead before they see a majority of the money. It's a system thats there to stop the financially irresponsible or unfortunate edge cases from starving to death or worse dying when they're old. I just wish more freedom was given to the people that pay into it. Let people do what they want with their money, I say. If the system is designed for each person to put in enough money to cover themselves in retirement then I see no reason that rich people should have to pay more. Don't punish successful people that got rich off the backs of others by taxing them more, by doing that you'll end up taxing successful good people unfairly. Go after unfair business practices and labor exploitation that way the bad people get ounished without catching good successful people in the crossfire.

The reason for me is the way I see it is that Palestine does deserve the right to self determination and in order to do that they have to get along with Jews, same goes for Israelis they have to get along w Palestineans. The issue I see is religion. Some not all like to throw the word Zionist like their some intellectual, but Zionism or a Jewish religious state is no different than the Muslim religious state like Iran Saudis Arabia etc. the way I see it is for Palestineans to be free from terror is they need to step away from religious fundamentalism, Iran before the Muslim revolution, women and young people had more freedoms in Iran in the 60s and 70s it all changed w religion. Places like Iran or Palestine would be batter if they separated state from religion, and I say the same thing in regards to Israel. Even tho many Israelis are Jewish, 20% are Israeli Arabs. U can be gay in Israel, Israel values western values of freedom, they arent perfect whatsoever, but a attack of Israel is like attack on western values. Judeo Christian values is what founded the USA. I think Palestineans are innocent and are stuck w these religious nutty extremist like Hamas. They deserve new leaders & new government.

They are not. Political compasses are a massive simplification of real world politics, they are not an accurate measure of actual political positions.   The inaccuracy is pretty evident in a lot of the things you stated:   >enviro is my economic ideology.  I don't see how environmentalism is an economic ideology at all. An environmentalist could believe in free markets, centralized planning, or whatever else in between.   >we'll never have effective communication without labels.  This is, yet again, an oversimplification. It's true labels are necessary, but it's valid to debate how specific/general they should be. What you are currently arguing for is extremely broad labels measured on two axes, which misses a lot of political nuance. In my view it is perfectly reasonable for someone to reject broad ideological labels in favour of more specific labels.  >Liberal - open minded, tolerant, for free enterprise.  Why are you lumping in tolerance with free enterprise? These are completely unrelated views that demonstrate how bad of a label this is. It also ignores that some people may be tolerant of some things but intolerant of others.    >Conservative - for family values  This isn't a definition of conservatism, this is just talking a common conservative talking point at face value. It ignores other common aspects of conservatism like religion, small governmentand deregulation.  >Libertarian - for deregulation.  Libertarian is about maximizing personal freedom, not deregulation. Deregulation is only one potential strategy for libertarianism. Libertarians also tend to believe in free enterprise and are nominally tolerant, which overlaps with your definition of liberalism.   >Economic socialism - putting production into the hands of the people.  >Communist - sharing wealth  These definitions are just bizarre. I think you have them backwards.  Overall your view seems rather uninformed and naive. You are putting simplicity over accuracy and claiming that this will help with communication when in reality oversimplifications and generalizations are one of the most common causes of misunderstandings.

So, first: oxygen and nitrogen are pretty much transparent to infrared, but C02 very much is not. There's a simple experiment (first performed in 1856) that demonstrates this:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnYMUMoo3E0    A reasonable response to that would be that the C02 cylinder is -pure- C02, but the atmosphere is only .04% - big difference. The -response- to that response would be that what matters is how much C02 is between the surface and space at any given point on earth, not how thinly it's distributed. You could think of the C02 like the pins in a pachinko machine: skinny, but they still slow the balls way down.    Atmospheric pressure is just about 1Kg/cm2, which means that there's a kilogram of air over every square cm of earth. CO2 makes up about .04% of the atmosphere, which in turn means that there's about .4g of CO2 hovering over every square centimeter of earth.    CO2 has a density of 1.87 Kg/m3 at atmosheric pressue, which means that that .4g would completely fill a column 1cm2 in cross section and 213 cm tall.      If you watch the video, that's -waay- bigger than the little tubes in the experiment. That tells -me- that Mme. Foote's experiment -understates- the issue, if anything.      Disclaimers:       * I'm simplifying the numbers by not accounting for how the atmosphere thins as it get higher up * the real atmoshpere transports heat via convection, and the experiment isn't big enough for that    also, as I understand it, C02 only -drives- warming. It causes a little warming, which causes more water to evaporate, which causes a LOT of warming (no water vapor is why deserts are hot during the day and cold at night - no insulation so they don't hold their heat).    By way of comparison, though, carbon MONoxide at the same concentration would wipe out pretty much all non-microbial animal life on earth in just a few hours O_o    Anyway, I hop this helps.

Similar to what you seem to be thinking, there are few things that appal me as much as liberal, progressive people justifying totalitarian regimes and oppressive states as "opposition" to otherwise also oppressive western, "legitimate" states.   I myself have been condemning Hamas as an atrocious force against the own Palestinian people way before its October hype. I've attempted to explain to dear Palestinians how bad this regime has been for their own sake.  I could also not agree more with you on the need for international justice bodies (like the ICJ/UN) with actual jurisdiction and punitive powers. I would be deeply delighted to see the Hamas leadership hand in hand with parts of  Netanyahu's government in jail convicted for war crimes.  But I'm sure we both understand that neither the ICJ nor the UN or any such international body, especially in the Western front is actually aiming for justice and peace in the region.  It's impossible not to see that the same bombs that help Ukrainians defend the aggression of the Russian state are used by aggressive Israel to demolish Gaza.  In a nutshell, any military act that feeds the military industrial complex and achieves geopolitical advancement for the US/NATO is supported, legitimized and promoted by the US and western media.  Coming back therefore to the genocide argument, and although I do insist that what Israel does is genocide, with intent and proof, I think that whether many of the supporters of this case understand or not what Hamas is and how it operates, which you correctly state, or not, we morally ought to support the case and at least bring Israel in front of any few morally sound justice process in the hope to restrict its oppression.  For me, the real heroes are the 600 prominent Israelis supporting the case.

Even more so because we are talking of reducing price by a little not necessarily by 25% of total profits per good.  The problem that i have with these models of the world is that   1- its not really reflective of reality, goods dont just tend to increase in price and stay there for no reason, it usually follows demand and supply laws for the most part. And you need more evidence than a "just so" story to claim it doesn't.  Because your claims require actors to cooperate in large scales with many other companies while having no trails of it or whistleblowers.  2- if it was indeed the case that this was happening to this scale, why are economists not writting a lot about this?

It is well known to be the strongest non-state actor in the world and probably the strongest and best armed in the immediate region and the most experienced.   > but Hezbollah has been mostly suffering losses (according to Al Jazeera, at least) without dealing much damage.  Most of their losses happened during the early days, Hezbollah is very tactical in their attacks. This is why you often saw them attacking military sights. These military installations include listening posts that are used for reconnaissance, surveillance posts that use various technologies to detect movement, heatseeking rocket emplacements, radio interceptions, automatic gun emplacements etc. All these equipment help Israel look deep into Lebanese territory and relates that info to drones or jets to strike. Which is why early on Hezbollah lost mainly fighters but it has slowed down as Israel became partially blinded thus they have been striking mostly civilians + journalists.  When it comes to loses you cannot believe Israel they always lie about their loses as seen in Gaza and elsewhere. Journalists inside Israel + hospital records show a different story.   **Tactics:**  Hezbollah military wing is very disciplined and follows a hierarchy of a regular military with a proper command structure. It's tactics are a combination of conventional  and guerrilla tactics depending on the situation. It has years of experience fighting and knowledge of Israeli tactics (from 1985 - 2000) and 2006 war. And has gained tons of battle experience for their younger recruits during the Syria war. In Syria it has advanced it's military capabilities this includes marksmanship, combined arms, communication, tactics and fighting against a guerrilla force. It has also trained and shared the battlefield with Russian special forces, IRGC, Syrian military and other allied militias. Its military wing has been present (often as advisors) on other battlefields and has gained this knowledge and experience this includes theatres such as: Iraq war, Yemen war, Syria and even Bosnian war.   For example the whole Gaza tunnel system was the idea of Qassem Soleimani and Imad Mughniye after it proved successful in Lebanon. Take 2006 [Bint Jbeil battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bint_Jbeil) where around 100 fighters managed to stop 5000 Israeli soldiers from taking a town due to this massive tunnel system.   **Firepower:**  Hezbollahs firepower is probably their strongest advantage compared Israels other enemies. unlike for example Khamas they are not landlocked and have access to tons of weapons including anti personal and advanced anti tank weapons. Besides that its ground troops are armed to the teeth with advanced equipment such as night visions, range finders, interception equipment, tactical gear and various advanced infantry equipment (for example one video in on the Syrian-Lebanese border a Hezbollah fighter was using GPS watch to guide mortars, something you would only see on modern militaries)  **Drones** - estimates are that they have more than 2000 suicide drones (probably much more) mostly supplied by Iran but have also used their own locally produced drone (which is based on the Iranian version) this is why its probably way more than 2000 attack drones also variety of different surveillance drones.   **Anti-armour** - plenty of these enough to waste them to kill 1 soldier, besides that they are very skilled in using them.   **Anti-ship** - has a variety of different anti-ship missiles and has used them in the 2006 war to hit Israeli ships. By now it has probably more advanced anti-ship missiles including the Russian Yakhont missiles.   **Anti-Air** - They are in possession of various anti air system from man pads to surface-to-air missile systems. This is probably their most secretive program and unknown of what they actually posses. For example USA has intercepted the (Iranian made) loitering 358 missile SAM meant for the Houthis which USA had no knowledge of. You can be assured that they also posses these systems.   **Missiles** - probably their biggest advantage, it has more missiles than most countries on the planet. This includes guided and unguided missiles that have a range to hit anywhere in Israel. Since 2006 they have worked hard to stock up on missiles and over the years Iran has provided advanced GPS systems to upgrade older missiles into guided missiles. In 2006 Israel estimated that Hezbollah had 13.000 missiles today they estimate that they have 100-150.000 missiles.   **Capability in all out war**  Their capability to cripple Israel is very real and has worked as a deterrent. For example the destruction of Lebanon infrastructure is tied to the destruction of Israeli infrastructure. They have the capability to hit all salient plants and deny Israel 80% of their drinking water, or all offshore gas drilling plants denying Israel of all electrical needs + shipping ports ruining them economically and tactically if salient plants and gas plants are destroyed. Also Israels nuclear plants are in sight. It has the capability to cripple Israel significantly in 1 day with only its missiles.    Besides all this Hezbollah has a very advanced cyber warfare team, that is used to monitor Israeli movement, reconnaissance and intelligence gathering in the field.   Hezbollah also has a very dedicated intelligence team that is often said to be very similar to Mossad and has had people inside the IDF high ranking military apparatus.

Every business does NOT need employees; it needs qualified people that can complete the work. There's a huge difference!   An entity can be structured as either an LLC or a C corp. An LLC is what is known as a pass through entity (taxes go straight to the owners tax return, google for better explanation please). An LLC is perfect for either a sole owner or partnership... Really ideal for anything where you're not going to want to add people on to ownership at a later point or list it publicly to sell shares.   C corporations: C corps are separately taxable entities. They file a corporate tax return (Form 1120) and pay taxes at the corporate level. They also face the possibility of double taxation if corporate income is distributed to business owners as dividends, which are considered personal taxable income. This is for big time businesses like those that you referenced above.  However, both entities can choose a S Corp election if they wanted to, which essentially would make the C Corp a pass through entity also. It would make sense to do this if you want to sell shares or add people down the line but still intended to keep it relatively small.  What does this have to do with your response?   So, now instead of the C Corp hiring employees and taking ALL the tax benefits from themselves, they now hire the employees S Corp or LLC.  How does this benefit the small time business?  1) Liability shielding. Legally protecting yourself better for starts, always very important to not mix personal funds and other businesses' fund. It can become very difficult to figure out who's money is whose and makes criminal acts a lot easier. If someone sues you they can go after anything you own if you have no entities, even if one business has nothing to do with the other.   Most importantly though, is what happens during a bankruptcy. Say for example your main occupation is a small LLC you set up with colleagues during college. Hmmm, you're an electrician in this example. The other people in the LLC are there for accounting and logistics, things every business needs to survive. You botch a job really badly because you made a stupid mistake and have no choice but to file bankruptcy over the lawsuit. Assume you also have a separate DJ business for the weekends, and a non profit Surprise Santa company for holidays. If you had no entities and did everything personally they could take your DJ equipment and Santa suits. Now, they can only take your electrical equipment and profits from that company. Some will say this is unfair, but it wouldn't be if everyone just formed the stupid entity to start with.  2) Business credit. Your small time businesses keep making consistent payments on their dj equipment loans and electrical tool loans. Your Santa Suit is finally paid off. Your Santa LLC now has pretty strong business credit and can now take out loans specifically in it's own name, and with a much stronger line.  3) There are other benefits, but I am not the most knowledgeable person to go into them. Mostly, the take away is that if you don't take advantage of these benefits the big time C Corps will, and you'll wind up giving away benefits that should be yours to them.  4) yes, our society loves to hire low skilled workers as employees instead of creating partnerships right from the start. It allows them to brainwash our society into thinking that they are not good enough to chase a smaller, more personalized version of the American dream. Imagine if everyone who worked their first restaurant job did it in an LLC of their choice after receiving instruction in the specific area of cooking they wanted to specialize. It would mean the worker would be doing the kind of cooking they wanted and businesses would have to pay fair compensation, not stealing any benefits! The laws may need to be adapted to better protect sub contractors such that they get the same rights as regular employees, though this is another huge debate since they will be giving up the benefits employers once took. Still, we can have this debate too if you would like, but be forewarned it is a lengthy one that makes this response look like a one word answer.

II. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT  The fall of man in Genesis chapter three warrants Gods ongoing need to restrain the ensuing evil in and from man. One of the primary means God has ordained (stemming from His holy attribute of perfect justice) in order to achieve restraint is the principle of just recompense. This idea is first illustrated in Genesis right after the fall. The pain of childbearing for the woman and the necessity of labor for mans/ mankinds survival (3:16-17) illustrate the just cost of mans disobedience  a cost to be borne by mankind into his distant, physical future. Further, in Genesis 9:6 God institutionalizes capital punishment:whoever sheds mans blood, by man his blood shall be shed.That is to say God will use corporate man as His surrogate to mete out His just recompense, in this case for murder. The due recompense for the premeditated murder of another man will be his death: corporeal punishment by corporate mankind. The idea here is more fully excogitated in Romans 13:1- 4. Scripture says in this regard: Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil. Notice first of all thatgoverning authorities(vs. 1) areestablished by God(vs. 1b) for the purpose of (among others)bearing the sword . . . an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil(vs. 4b). This same idea is echoed by 1Peter 2:13-14: Submit yourselves for the Lords sake to every human institution; whether to a king as the one in authority; or to governors as sent by Him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. Human institutions( ,anthropine ktisei)(that which is created for humans [by God]) existfor the punishment of evildoers.This basic truth is foundational to a proper understanding of the role of government in general and in specific as it relates to the subject of war. Gods design, the purpose of government in large measure, is to curtail the evil deeds of men; it is to deter the further wrongdoing of man against the weak and defenseless; it is a form of Gods restraining grace in a fallen world. This fundamental purpose of Government can be expanded to include not only the need to protect its citizenry from evil from within, but to protect its citizenry from evil from outside. In this sense, government isa minister of God for your good.  III. GOVERNMENTS GOING TO WAR  If this is the purpose of government, then it follows that God would expect a nation to protect itself from forces of evil outside its borders, outside forces that would attempt to harm innocent people in some way. It follows that many times in the OT Israel had to defend itself from the plundering onslaught of the Philistines, Assyrians and Babylonians. (And depending on Israels obedience or disobedience to God, God would allow Israel to either be victorious or defeated respectively.) In fact, as mentioned in the introduction, God commanded Israel to go to war in Deuteronomy 20:1: When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you. Further evidence of God condoning a nations self interest through the use of war are the following NT illustrations: John the Baptist does not condemn a Roman soldier for going to war. Rather he says,be content with your wages(Luke 3:14). And, when Cornelius the Centurion was won to Christ the Apostles did not condemn his vocation (Acts 10:1; 44-48; cf. Luke 14:31). Their response is unlike Jesus in John 8:11, wherein he tells the woman adultererGo. From now on sin no more. These and other passages serve to illustrate the idea that God is not adverse to governments engaging in war; that is part of the reason He created them  to in this way benefit mankind. Again, the more difficult question is this: WHEN IS GOING TO WAR JUSTIFIABLE IN GODS EYES? Certainly the ancient practice of conquest and plundering another nation for the sake of gaining their wealth and new slaves is not a justifiable cause for war. So then what is? What are the specific earmarks that can help us to ascertain the justifiable and unjustifiable use of war in the eyes of God?  IV. THE EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF JUSTIFIABLE WAR  Throughout centuries of discussions relative to the ethics of war usage, amongst Christians and non-Christians alike, there has developed a broadly, internationally acceptedJust War Theory.Historically in the Church, the primary believers to tackle the issue of war from a philosophical standpoint were Augustine of Hippo and then some 900 years later, Thomas Aquinas. Augustine addresses war in his classic book,The City of God:  They who have waged war in obedience to the divine command, or in conformity with His laws, have represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom of government, and in this capacity have put to death wicked men; such persons have by no means violated the commandment, Thou shalt not [murder].  Centuries later Thomas Aquinas began to codify Augustines thoughts on war into a punch list of indicators as to if or not a war is ethically justifiable. The modern day summary of that moral pursuit follows. Given the fact that some of the best ancient Christian scholars originated the skeletal aspects of theJust War Theory,it should come as no surprise to todays believers that each is undergirded with biblical truth! In summary, war is morally right, or justifiable (the Latin phrase for this isjus ad bellummeaning the right to go to war) only when embarking on it meets the following eight criteria:

At 15mpg you are using about 800 gallons per year (milesmpg) . At $3/gallon, thats $2400/year  Prius and many other hybrids gets 45mpg easily(actually rated over 50mpg in the city)   At 45mpg, you are using 267 gallons per year. At $3/gallon, thats $800. That is a difference of $1,600 per year. If you spent $10k buying a hybrid, you'd pay for it in GAS ALONE in 6.25 years.  At the time, I traded in my 2001 Silverado and got a 2011 Prius. The prius cost $10k outright, not with trade in. So my payback period was much shorter. I drove it for about 8 years.  Note: I'd add that if you bought a hybrid car that costs $10k more than your truck that it would probably be significantly nicer too. Trucks are way more expensive. My personal recommendation if you are ever looking at doing this is to buy a slightly used plug-in hybrid vehicle that qualifies for the $4000 tax credit. You can operate it like a regular hybrid and get the 50 mpg if you never want to plug it in, but the $4000 credit isn't being factored in to most dealer costs because they are unaware it exists.

To tie it back to your original question, if the US did not defend Taiwan, it would justify China's decision. That would be an equally ominous course of action as it would deflate the very defensive strategy the US has used for the past decades (i.e. act as if you will defend Taiwan).  Nationalism is a characteristic of almost every form of government. The high requirement of 'social stability' (as seen in the lengths the CCP goes to prevent any kind of protestation, discourse, or intellectual challenge to their own prerogative) is the unique characteristic of the CCP's theory of governance compared to most 1st world nations. Their need for social stability means an act that incurs the wrath of the US puts CCP's legitimacy in jeopardy. That is the bigger downside for them. And they know it. Hence why they won't invade Taiwan.

Thats where the power to keep it running comes from.  If there is a problem with this system, then backup pumps powered by diesel engines can keep the reactor cooled while the primary system is fixed. Its very rare that even this secondary system needs to be used. The capacity factor of a power source represents how often it is working at its theoretical maximum capacity. Basically, its a measure of how reliably the source can put out energy. Nuclear reactors consistently [have the highest capacity factor of any power source, usually just over 90%.](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_6_07_b)  If this system fails, or if there is another serious issue, the reactor can be shut down using a SCRAM system, where a control rod is dropped into the reactor to stop the nuclear reaction. This is a pretty hard failsafe, as inserting a control rod like this makes the chain reaction that powers a reactor unable to occur.  Nuclear reactors are in fact the safest power source out there, period. Over decades of operation in 36 countries, Chernobyl and Fukushima are the only serious accidents that have ever occurred at nuclear plants - with Chernobyl being a completely outdated reactor design with nowhere near the safety features of a Western nuclear reactor. Three Mile Island is another commonly cited nuclear disaster, but in fact the scientific consensus is that not a single person was even harmed in any way, let alone killed, by this disaster.

Fewer than half of voters have expressed similar misgivings about Mr. Trump.  > Even though we know both candidates are three and a half years apart, one side seems to have it sticking a little more, and thats going to be a concern, said Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin.  > Some of it comes down to basic physical differences.  > Mr. Bidens voice has grown softer and raspier, his hair thinner and whiter. He is tall and trim but moves more tentatively than he did as a candidate in 2019 and 2020, often holding his upper body stiff, adding to an impression of frailty. And he has had spills in the public eye: falling off a bicycle, tripping over a sandbag.  > Mr. Trump, by contrast, does not appear to be suffering the effects of time in such visible ways. Mr. Trump often dyes his hair and appears unnaturally tan. He is heavyset and tall, and he uses his physicality to project strength in front of crowds. When he takes the stage at rallies, he basks in adulation for several minutes, dancing to an opening song, and then holds forth in speeches replete with macho rhetoric and bombast that typically last well over an hour, a display of stamina.  > It is the perception of how you communicate, said Carol Kinsey Goman, a speaker and coach on leadership presence. When Trump makes those kinds of faux pas, he just brushes it off, and people dont say, Oh, hes aging. He makes at least as many mistakes as Joe Biden, but because he does it with this bravado, it doesnt seem like senility. It seems like passion.

Let me check. ... tic toc, tic toc, tic toc, tic toc....  No. You're definitely right, and the problem isn't confined to the southeast. Here's an [article from Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/botanical-sexism-cultivates-home-grown-allergies/) written by an arborist who has been campaigning about this for several years. The problem isn't so bad where I live because the city is still fighting Dutch Elm disease, even if it is probably a losing battle, and the old elms are still the dominant species. They are monoecious - both male and female organs on the same plant - and the pollen finds a nearby happy home and doesn't have to travel.   Speaking of 'travel' the absolute worst allergy problem is likely caused by the ginkgo tree. This is an incredibly tough relative of the conifers, resistant to a large number of pests and diseases and also to urban pollution. It has only been popular in the eastern USA, I think that was the subject of my vague memory. Unlike most plants the ginkgo pollen produces motile sperm, and when it enters a nose it proceeds to swim up to the nether regions. Think about that for awhile.   So yes, the choices of urban areas as to what trees they plant has indeed contributed to the problem, but like most bad things in this world there is more than one contributing factor. Both species (and sex) choice for urban areas AND climate change are factors.

Bullshit. The Palestinian Arab Congress was first convened in 1919 as a national union of the local Muslim-Christian associations that had been set up in nearly all major Palestinian towns. They held seven annual congresses in Jerusalem, Haifa, and Nablus between then and 1928 and sent delegates to the WW1 peace conferences in Paris and Sevres.  Moreover, the Arabs of Palestine were not "Tribal", except for the Bedouin. They were Ottoman subjects who farmed or lived in towns and cities. They knew exactly what Palestine was because the land that constitutes modern-day Palestine had been administratively separated from the Damascus Eyalet in 1841, and raised to district status in 1871. Many of them, prior to the war, probably thought of themselves not as Palestinians, but as Muslim or Christian Arab Ottoman subjects - until the moment it became clear that the Ottomans were no longer going to be a thing, and Wilson's 14 points of self-determination were suddenly all the rage, and maybe the Arab nationalists who had met in exile in Paris in 1913 had actually been right about the future of the region  And frankly the implication here is fucking disgusting. So what, just because you think they didn't have a "firm understanding of their borders" that therefore it's okay for some foreigners to post up and invent a new country in the middle of their country? Do you think that just because the Afghanis are "Tribal" it would be okay for, I don't know, fucking Canadians to turn up and nick a few parts of Afghanistan and name them "new montreal"?

Our modern idea of "success" after the industrial revolution took place two centuries ago is so deeply ingrained in us.

At least, representative democracy as is practiced in, say, the USA. I would be far more amenable to a more Distributist position, in which communities/municipalities are more commonly made up of neighbors and friends, rather than simple governments dictated by one's charm or money. Frankly, you are quite correct in saying that Democracy is better than Monarchy, only because fallen people cannot have unchecked power. I think it incorrect though, to posit a monarch as being unchecked.  These critiques apply to a presidential system, but not to a parliamentary one. In a parliament, the leader of the party has de facto control over the direction of the country since with a majority in parliament they can force through any law they want and get centralized control over the direction of the party. This also means that a prime minister is a very clearly identifiable entity in terms of them making mistakes and screwing up.  > Having said that, I think democracy has at its center the idea of self. That's problematic to me.   What do you mean by this? A democracy has at its centre the notion that all authority rests in God, and that the elected leader, as vicar of the people, wields his authority as a steward rather than as a sovereign. Its not a sense of self, but rather a sense of fraternal love and self sacrifice that defines democracy.  > However, I will cede that there are no perfect men/women who might rule in such a fashion. I would prefer one evil person though, to many. Monarchs were successful for lots of reasons, and they only stopped being so when the violated certain principles.  A single evil person wielding absolute power is far more damaging to the virtue of the people than the unified Voice even of an inquitous population, for even the most iniquitous of peoples will have even some virtuous voices to dilute their evil, but a single evil person with all power vested in themselves to rule separately and apart from all - even God - will indeed be worse.  > No system, indeed, is perfect. Like CS Lewis said, there is no equality in man. To believe that somehow democracy, even foisted upon fallen men is good, is too much in favor of mankind's rule. It falls then to the distinction between rights, as traditionally desired in democracy. I think there's a post about the protection of rights from monarchs in this very thread. Rights are worthless without their being weighed directly against our obligations. Monarchy, however,, instills in us this idea. Perhaps detrimental, but nonetheless correctly.  The idea of rights versus obligations misunderstands rights. Rights exist insofar as they are demanded by the common good and mans dignity, and not for any other reason. Framing rights as a question of freedom (defined as a mere freedom of choice) is misplaced. The idea of obligations is assumed in any Christian talk of rights because rights presuppose (and follow from) the common good. One has a right to free association or to free speech insofar as these rights are predisposed by the common good and mans dignity.  With that said, a monarchical system is similar to capitalistic one. Its akin to the privatization of government. And like unchecked privatization, it suffers the same problems. While private property is certainly difficult to condemn *in itself*, its restriction (through regulation, taxation and indeed where necessary public property) is presupposed by the common good, and furthermore while private stewardship of property is necessary, the benefits must be shared widely.   Likewise with government, the privatization of the stewardship of authority may be justified in some limited instances and is difficult to condemn *in itself*, but like property must be wielded to the common benefit.  And unlike property, there is almost no situation where monarchical rule is prudent, for there is almost no situation where it in anyway improves the common wellbeing.  > Perhaps I've misunderstood the point you were making. I find that it is less about Monarchy bad and Democracy good, and more about the recognition of people as fallen, all with similar obligations (whatever we have of rights) and finally, a recognition that the equality of mankind as preached in such a democracy, is flawed. Mankind is not equal (and I do not mean because of race or religion or age).  > What I do mean is, some are smarter, like you are smarter than me. You may, however, not be as tall as me. And those things, in reality, are linked directly to our conception of equality. I am not equal to you, say, in the task or say of government. That means I shouldn't participate. If I was very rich and trained my whole life in governance (using historical monarchy as an example) then why should I not yield in obligation?  This is the most pernicious of the lies of monarchical rule. Mankind is equal in fallenness and sin, and merely because of ones fact of birth to a rich family does not ipso facto imply greater virtue. But mankind is also not equal in wisdom. Yet merely because one is born to a rich family, that does not, likewise, imply that one is more wise.  Perhaps a philosopher king, well learned in theology and the sciences would make the best ruler. But unfortunately,  humans being as they are we are left with far more ineffectual monarchs than we are extraordinary ones, and for every extraordinary one we are left with one downright *evil* one. And that situation is no better than the worst of democracies.

If possible, and keeping in mind that its not a perfect number, just for consideration and introducing a better, and perhaps, a more attainable numbered goal for the globe, with that average (27-33 kg of CO2 a year) in mind and knowing trees can take decades to mature to that level of sequestering: what would be a good goal for everyone to set to offset the target amount of emissions?  If we know housing has an average of x amount of planting space and commercial properties have x amount of planting space and farms have x amount of planting space, we may be able to calculate a recommended (or enforced) amount of tree planting world-wide annually to offset emissions and create a greener future.   Right now we are losing 15 billion trees a year and only planting 1-5 billion, and neglecting so much plantable space. Planting trees seems to be the most sustainable, simplest and accessible solution; not only will it create a more visually luscious future, it will also help clean our air, help moisture retention, cool temperatures, fill wells, create biodiversity, prevent storms, fires and droughts.    Globalforestwatch.org displays how much deforestation there is and organizations such as onetreeplanted.org can plant trees for $1 each but here in the USA, most towns have access to nurseries.   Again, I appreciate the time you both have put into this to address our questions. Thank you!

The US as of today operates 93 nuclear reactors after 43 years or so. And 1 nuclear reactor needs 3,125,000 solar panels in order to match 1 reactor. 100 nuclear reactors therefore will need 312,500,000 solar panels to replace. Each of those solar panels only last about 15 to 20 years and then they need to be disposed of and replaced. So for solar to match 100 nuclear reactors in output for 40 years, we will need 625,000,000 panels. Plus all the nuts, bolts, man hours, fuel, roads, infrastructure, cables, and not to forget land mass to support all of that.  if we have 200 nuclear reactors, we now need 1.25 billion solar panels to produce the same energy as those 200 reactors can for over 40 years.     https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2019/01/f58/Ultimate%20Fast%20Facts%20Guide-PRINT.pdf  pdf page 3 nuclear facts.

Yes biodiversity is truly a miracle (in the metaphorical sense, I don't believe in miracles) and should be celebrated and cherished. But I honestly doubt there's a significant amount of people who would realize that humanity might go extinct but the planet will still be able to support life, and their reaction to that would be to actively support the ecocide. Sure there are misanthropic doomers, but not enough to make a dent.  And sure I don't *know* it will be fine. But I am pretty fucking certain that you overestimate humanity in their ability to end all life on earth (which is ironically very anthropocentric). Even if we would all actively pursue the ecocide and then would release all nuclear arms on top of that, it wouldn't suffice to end all life on earth.  And even if we would somehow manage to eradicate all higher lifeforms, in a couple hundred million years evolution would have created a new world brimming with life.   Of course I'm not saying that would be in any way good, just that your perspective is very anthropocentric. We are nothing, we only exist for a second on the timescale of the planet. There was rich life before us, and there will be rich life after we're long gone.  What's also very anthropocentric, is to think that our planet is the only one that has life in such a gigantic universe...

With Arabs I think it's knowing trump will throw more resources towards Israel and 0 towards Palestinians and basically give Israel free reign of what they really want to do and cause a lot more casualties, a lot more war crimes, and I think maybe in their hope is that the rest of the world will see how bad it is getting and actually step in.

This is one of the many reasons why counter-insurgency is so difficult; yes you need to kill the insurgents otherwise theyll keep attacking you. But in doing so you may create martyrs, which in turn can lead to increased recruitment, both from the deceaseds family & friends, as well as from international communities that are sympathetic to the insurgents cause.   We saw this early on in the latest Iraq war where students, or other groups of young Muslims came from Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other Muslim countries, to come and fight in the holy war (jihad) against the infidel invaders (American & coalition forces) in Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe it was mostly Sunnis from predominantly Sunni countries, however, as the war progressed, we even saw an influx of Shiite Muslims come from Iran, which is historically rare that they would join forces (especially Iran as theyve been at odds with the rest of the Middle East for quite some time as the only non-Arab country in the region).   I guess my point is that any counter-insurgency operations are extremely difficult; this particular situation is exacerbated by the fact that this Israeli/Palestinian conflict has been going on for more than half a century. Compounded by the fact that the insurgents are literally operating in their own backyard and vice versa, as opposed to what we saw in Iraq/Afghanistan where the occupying force has been deployed halfway around the world from their home. Its much more complex considering that both sides are operating on their own home terf.

However the official reports from IPCC are deliberately conservative so as to not be caught exaggerating and therefore lose the confidence of the people.  Therefore the fact that warming is above IPCC is actually expected.  This also means than containing to 1.5C is nearly impossible and containment to 2C also appears highly unlikely unless there is a huge step jump in cheap new technology or an as yet identified natural buffer emerges (cloud formation for example).   We will probably prove the truism that telling the truth as best as possible (without conservative bias) is the most effective form of communication.

Also, close the records of people convicted of crimes, treating it like a juvenile court, with records sealed from the general public.   People can only see your background if you are working with kids, dealing with top level security, using a gun at your work, the job involves alcohol/drugs, or if you are dealing with large amounts of money.   We want people to get out of jail and into the general population of society, but make it almost impossible to do so. I hear all the time how hard it is to get a job after a non-violent crime such as drug possession. Now imagine if you have rape or murder on your record. It's almost impossible to get back into society, and as a result, they turn to crime to make a living.   Our criminal justice system should focused more on rehabilitation rather than punishment. Yes, there will always be exceptions. I don't think Jeffery Epstein should have never ever gotten out of prison.

But you wouldnt be able to. Because, perhaps there is something that is beyond human understanding. That thing would not be able to be understood by you. Or any of us.  As an atheist, my problem with arguments like this from theists is that they are the same people who argue that human morality, what *we* understand to *be* morality and good or bad, comes from god.  So it then becomes worse than a cop-out, it's a straight up contradiction to then tack on "oh but also god's morality is beyond our understanding"  Innocent kids dying of cancer isn't beyond the understanding of morality that this god imparted in me as a human though, is it? And I can judge god to be an inhumane, immoral bastard by that sense of morality. It's a strange thing to describe a god as having a sense of morality so great it's ineffable to the human mind and yet would simultaneously fail the most elementary human sniff test of right and wrong.  It doesn't matter how a theist tries to spin it, they're describing a god undeserving of worship or adulation, because then this:  >Attributing motivations to such a being is already a silly exercise from the start.  Becomes an argument *against* holding any religious beliefs, which necessarily claim to know all sorts of things about the nature of a god, what it is and what it wants.  What we can say is - to invoke the riddle of Epicurus - if there is a supreme being who is all-powerful, aware of suffering on Earth and able to do something about it if so inclined, then that being must not be inclined.  We can argue against OP's position that "not inclined" doesn't necessarily translate to either "malevolence" or "indifference" because there is still the third option of "not indifferent, but considers the suffering to be in some way necessary or justifiable nonetheless" (perhaps in the same way we justify performing medical research on live animals, or whatever example)  And that's all well and good, but outside of the most abstract classroom exercises in philosophy, we don't talk about gods in this manner. We talk about them for and because of religions. If we can't claim to know anything about any god, god is a useless word and a useless concept and we're left to just shrug at a hypothetical which is probably slightly less interesting than "Are we in The Matrix?"  Does that count as CMV for OP's position? I don't know, but it feels given context it's probably not the most useful shift in perspective.

That doesnt mean that they are justified, only that if Israel wants this to end, they need to change their attitude towards the Palestinians as we can all see this stance has not worked for at least half a century.   I think the rest of the world is finally either not afraid to stand for the Palestinian people anymore because of the nature of the Israeli backlash, or have their eyes open to what is taught is a bastion of freedom and justice in the Middle East, committing atrocities.   The point about Syria is only sound if we treat the Netanyahu regime the same as the Assad regime. We expect more from Israel then we do from Syria.

This on it's own is a hugely diverse field. Oversimplifying it (and not including meteorological satellites here), there are 2 kinds of instruments deployed on satellites: imaging cameras, and spectrometers. Cameras allow us to do image detection and track obvious ecological things like greenness, water-levels, and fires, etc. Those are all cool, but personally I'm biased and think the exciting instruments are the spectrometers.  With those satellites, the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases can be calculated. Retrieval algorithms use Bayesian inverse analysis (basically least squares fitting with prior information) to minimize the difference between their modelled and observed data.  What I think is exciting and important about this field is that the next generation of instruments will give researchers the precision and resolution they need to start estimating using these atmospheric measurements to quantify how much individual sources emit to the atmosphere. This is super important, because it will allow us to track how well different policy interventions actually change the levels of GHGs in the atmosphere (which is what ultimately matters, as opposed to what happens on accounts desks, imho). With this kind of technology, governments could hold individual companies responsible for their actual emissions, as opposed to what they report. (In particular, oil and gas emissions of methane are higher than have been reported for over the last decade.)  That could be possible in an ideal world. In reality, satellite observations are limited in how often they get a clear view of the scene they are trying to observe, and there are practical limits to how much data can be acquired. So more work developing complementary methods is important too. As is the work validating these measurements. (Planes measure in situ above ground based stations which are used to calibrate the satellite measurements. All of these stages have people working there, and working on improving their research methods, as is true of any field really). Also, I would want to give a quick shout out to solar-induced fluorescence observations as a cool ecology-physics-remote sensing triple whammy that might peak your interest. (Tracking photosynthesis from space).  What I like most about this field is how collaborative it is. Research prospects at national labs is perhaps better than for some other subjects, and the private sector is expanding in the field too. And worst case scenario, a degree in climate physics is at least equilivant to a data science PhD. Banks are usually the second highest employers of climate physics PhDs, (financial risk management is a lot of Bayesian inversion as well?)  The downside to the field, I suppose for newcomers especially is that it can be that it can be hard to find a placement doing *precisely* what you want to do.

I'm not a fan of Biden, at least in comparison to any other Democrat(well I do prefer him to Kamala, but that's the lowest bar imaginable).  I would have loved for Bernie to be POTUS.  But he didn't win.  And Biden is absolutely the most Progressive POTUS on these subjects, by a huge margin.  Also, you mock him for not coming around until he was in his 60s, but in reality, it's *far* more difficult for someone to change their mind about huge issues like this when they're that age.  We constantly scorn Boomers for refusing to acknowledge new ways of thinking.  We cannot also scorn them for finally doing so because 'it took them too long '.  It's even more of a point for Bernie that he has been on the correct side of every issue for 60 years now, but that doesn't diminish Biden finally coming around on this stuff, especially since he's a tremendously devout Catholic, and being pro-LBGTQ is a highly unpopular stance amongst that group.

Maybe what you meant to say was your perception of how fast climate change is occurring has changed from just a few years into the future to decades or the end of century for what you consider the worse case scenarios.  But maybe you don't understand the progression expected with climate change. The worst case scenarios will occur as individual events of extreme weather.   All of Miami will not flood at a resting sea level for another hundred years or more. But two major hurricanes, within a short period of time, can and will destroy existing structures and prevent rebuilding due to the threat of more major flooding events.   Miami's ocean front will become abandoned well before sea-level actually floods Miami on a normal pleasant day. One cannot keep rebuilding every few years after extreme weather events. The cost is prohibitive. This has no 'exact' time line. However, this sort of repeated disaster scenario is projected to occur within a couple of decades.  Within the life times of anybody younger than 40 years old, the worst cases scenarios of turbulent weather scenarios will occur. Drought, fires, floods, tornados, hurricanes, heat are all going to happen at unprecedented levels, unknown during the complete history of mankind itself  The terminology that is being used now refers to the once in a 1000 years or 5000 years weather event. There will be no human recorded levels of which to compare extreme weather events in the near future of those already born.   These extreme weather events are actually progressing faster than expected. In recent years, climate specialists keep updating a worsening trend of extreme weather events.  Oceans may take hundreds of years to rise to their maximum levels, but extreme weather just keeps escalating in major destructive ways every year.  I don't think you fully appreciate the ways these extreme events effects humans.   The Syrian civil war and ISIS developed in response to an extreme drought and dislocation of people with no means of supporting their lives. The resulting disruption of life from a major drought also caused a major migration to European countries causing all sorts of political mayhem. Great Britain did the Brexit largely based on the political dislike for immigration, namely arab immigration of people fleeing.  Central America is also gripped by droughts and hurricanes which have always caused an illegal immigration influx at The US border.   The time is soon, when a worldwide shortage of food stocks is projected. The US West and Australia will soon approach the day when a combined drought will be extreme enough to decimated world wheat production levels.

You don't need to kill every single Hamas member for a new power to go, and regardless, Israel is reported to kill about 30% of Hamas members and injure about 30% more - giving it 60% disablement of all Hamas force.   Some of your other comments you make miss the fact that this war is not a tit for tat war, it has actual goals.  You say violence breeds violence - while this may have been an argument for not responding to October 7th (and to be fair, it's a pretty weak argument when you compare it to the arguments for) - after 4 months, it's not significant anymore. it's not that if Israel is going to continue with it's attack for few months now, there would be more radical Palestinians than if it would stop now. This radicalization is closer to binary than a linear.     Moreover, you kind of miss the point that if Israel stops right now, Hamas are in power, in charge of education and media etc. which also leads to massive radicalization as it's in Hamas' incentives. only if you remove Hamas you can actually tackle this problem.      You say you're pretty sure that Gazans would elect another person - but why? all of the polls show massive support for October 7th, Hamas in all negotiations for stopping the war (which Israel suggested already) doesn't want to cease control, there isn't any other body in Gaza that can fight Hamas as they control just about everything - what makes you think that there would be elections, and if there would be - what makes you think that Hamas wouldn't win them again?      your point 6 is misinformation. I know you've heard it, but just yesterday I did my research on it. what happened is that when Israel did the blockade, it calculated the number of calories, as well as vitamins and nutrients that needs to go into the Gaza strip before malnutrition (not starvation). It makes sure that the number isn't below that, but doesn't limit the number anyways. And you cite number of deaths in the WB, how many terror attacks came out of the WB in these years - I don't understand your point here.     about the Apartheid, honestly, nation state law is very stupid, but you don't really understand it's meaning... You just have to look at the data to see that Israel isn't apartheid state... you just have to visit Israel and see it in your own eyes.     While you choose to ignore the evidence there are for Hamas killing children and sexual assault etc. (unless you go full conspiracy and claim that Israel raped women and killed it's own women)  - It's not about surprise - it's about understanding that you cannot live next to a terrorist group. If suddenly ISIS would pop in the Mexico border of the US, I promise you that the US gov wouldn't be just cool with that. Personally, I think it's long overdue.

Excess sugars are converted into fat. The energy that is burned is coverted to CO2, which we breathe out, and water. So basically one of three things happens to the carbon in seaweed:  1. It is burned by the body and produces CO2 2. It is stored as fat 3. Undigested carbohydrates leave your body through your intestines.  In what ratios this happens Idk, and probably depends a lot on your metabolism and diet. The same applies to any food.  The more relevant question to ask would be how much transport is needed for seaweed farms, and how energy-intensive it is to grow. Depends also how far the seaweed farm is from your home.  Best way to reduce your carbon footprint is eating things that are in season (if you eat strawberries in winter, big chance they come from an energy-intensive greenhouse) and grown locally, while avoiding meat and other products that take a lot of surface area to produce.

Most notably, more factories will be built to expand production of 155mm shells (of which any and all increased production was contingent on this aid bill passing), including new factories in TX and PA, as well as increased production of PGMs such as LRASM and JASSM-ER, PAC-3 MSE, and more.   Due to the bill passing, there will likely be an additional 150,000 jobs created over the next 6 months or so in numerous fields, many of them in high-tech and high skill areas.

Its time to escalate and look for other people willing to.  Look for groups engaging in a systematic building, taking, and flexing power. You and your local community have the **collective** power to change things through your force as producers and reproducers. Escalatory tactics look like strikes, sit-ins, blocking roads, blocking projects. These tactics disrupt the flow of capital and therefore provide leverage. Capital is the lifeblood of this system and they who control it control what occurs. All these tactics are possible through organizing effectively and militantly by talking to your neighbors, community and likeminded people.

This phenomenon is known as the "natural gas bridge" and is related to the intermittent nature of wind and solar power. while wind and solar power can reduce the use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, they can increase the demand for natural gas due to their intermittent nature and the need for backup power sources. However, the overall impact on natural gas demand will depend on the specific circumstances and the availability of other energy storage and backup options. So far there has always been a natural gas bridge accompanying large on boarding of wind and solar.   And I wasnt talking about gasoline .

2021-10-25 21:45:59, 0.009148289656105485, reddit_opinion_democrats.csv, actual_text_used_for_scoring: JUST CAUSE  Is the reason for engaging in war morally right, such as defending a nation from an evil aggressor? As noted in the introduction, in Revelation 19:11, God furiously wages war against the Antichrist. Notice His principle for engagement: And I saw heaven opened; and behold, a white horse and He who sat upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war. This is a glorious passage of the awesome spectacle of the triumphal Second Coming of Christ. Herein observe that Godwages waronly when it is for arighteouscause.It follows that those nations considering waging war should do likewise: only consider engagement when the cause isjustifiably righteous. Conquering other nations is usually a wrong objective of war because God is for a diversification of nations per Genesis 11. To in any way invade, usurp or colonize another nation is the wrong objective for the use of war. God intentionallyscatteredthe nations, (11:8) and it is His intent that they be keptscattered. (Thank God that this Genesis 11:8 idea is deeply, unwaveringly embedded in our nations fabric! Our nation possesses the mightiest war power in world history  a might that could be used alternatively to conquer the world if it were not for our deep convictions stemming from Genesis 11:8! In light of our military muscle, may our continual awareness, understanding of, and convictions stemming from Genesis 11:8 never depart from our corporate culture, our thinking as a nation.) THE WAR CRITERIA OF JUST CAUSE MEANS THAT IN SOME OVERT WAY A NATIONS SOVEREIGNTY IS DIRECTLY THREATENED Just Cause is the first principle for a nation to consider when pondering the use of war. A direct threat to a nation need be imminent in order to warrant the use of war.  B. COMPETENT AUTHORITY  This next principle asks this question: Has the aggression that a nation is responding to, been declared and/ or proliferated by the actual authority within the nation? Said differently, is a nations consideration of going to war in response to a renegade or third party covert action within the nation? This distinction helps to guard against and discern the existence of parties other than those in actual authority who may desire tounrighteouslyandunjustifiablyaccelerate a war by the use of deception and agitation. It is not just for our nation to declare war on another nation that is not responsible for the evil actions being propagated within its own geographical boundaries. This principle is rooted as well in 1Peter 2:13-14.  C. COMPARATIVE JUSTIFICATION  This third principle means this: By way of stark comparison, it should be apparent that the actions of the enemy are morally wrong and the actions of the nation bringing the war are morally right. Notice Romans 13:3 in this regard: For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. The point here is so simple that it could be overlooked: if another nation is doing what is morally right, there is no justification to go to war with them. Relatively speaking, there must be a stark, comparative justification for engaging in the action of war: THE INJUSTICE SUFFERED BY ONE PARTY MUST SIGNIFICANTLY OUTWEIGH THAT SUFFERED BY THE OTHER BRINGING THE WAR For instance, the added plight that Americas invasion brought on the French people was justifiable in comparison to the atrocities suffered under Hitler because it was a moral contrast between unjustifiable national conquest and captivity versus the hope and cost of national liberation.  D. RIGHT INTENTION  Is the purpose of the war to achievejusticeandrighteousnessor one of conquest, pillage, and destruction  or perhaps the motives are vengeful? Proverbs 21:2 speaks to what underlies the need to discern right intentions: Every mans way is right in his own eyes, But the Lord weighs the hearts. Many passages speak of mans ability to be self-deceived due to the fall (cf. Proverbs 16:2; 24:12; 1Samuel 16:7; 1Corinthians 4:4). The noetic effect of sin, if unchecked by the counsel of Gods Word and the advice of other godly people, can lead to the manifestation of bad intentions. Relative to the sinful proclivities of man, the OT book of Judges states,every man did what was right in his own eyes(17:6) but in doing so they did wrong. Man, in realization of his sinfulness need always obtain the godly counsel of others (cf. Proverbs 13:10). Proverbs 24:6 summarily states how one ought to wage a war that God approves relative to this principle of right intentions: For by wise guidance you will wage war, And in abundance of counselors there is victory. It is critically important to carefully discern if or not the motives and intentions for going to war are just. This can only be accomplished through the counsel of many. It follows then that a nation should not wage war unilaterally by its executive; to seek congressional approval is an idea that is supported by Scripture. Such approval is a check and balance that is necessary in response to the realization that we are often lacking in the best judgment or ability to discern if or not our motives and intentions are proper and God honoring. It summarily follows that establishing right intentions is a sure-footed scriptural principle. Having stated the principle clearly, it is not difficult to ascertain right intentions given Syria President Assads blatant slaughter of innocent people.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep12108.14](https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep12108.14)  >Israels military and civilian sectors overlap considerably more than those of most countries. Large numbers of conscripts and reservists continually cycle through the IDFs active-duty components.  The IDF regulars are filled by all male and female citizens, with slight excuses for the ultra-religious, women who become mothers, and those whose non-army jobs are deemed essential for national security (i.e. they fulfill their natsec duty by other means).  >Male officers must serve in the regular army for 48 months, male nonofficers for 36 months, and females for 24 98 months.   >   >...   >   >Over the past 25 years, the reserve components have accounted for approximately 75 percent of Israels total military manpower.   >   >...   >   >Most Israelis enter the reserves immediately following a 2- or 3-year stint in the regular forces.  They stay in the reserves until they physically age out:  40 for men or women, though women who marry or get pregnant are exempted.  Reserves cycle through the army once per year.  Israel developed its "reserve" based system the way it did, because  >Israels economic condition precluded the possibility of maintaining a large standing army  yet they desired an army so large that all of their citizens needed to be involved.  Their unique "reserve" based system  >relies on the rapid mobilization of large numbers of well-trained reservists to complement its smaller regular \[every freshly adult Jew, Druze, or Circassian citizen\] force. Most reservists \[whomever is selected at any given time from all the rest of the <41 year old citizens, <61 year old in some specialties\] are expected to join their units and acquire their equipment within 24-48 hours of receiving a call-up order. Some specialized units are required to mobilize even faster. The IDF expects Air Force reservists, for example, to respond within hours of a surprise attack. Their function is to begin attacking enemy forces immediately while also protecting less-ready IDF units undergoing mobilization.  This is a standing army.  Several hours to 24 to 48 hours mobilization time is about how long it takes for a regular army to assemble whatever of its soldiers might be on short term leave when the call to action occurs.  Indeed, Israel's General Yadin  >famously characterized the Israeli reservist as a soldier on 11 months annual leave.  Israel's desire was to have a massive standing army in parallel with a functioning economy, and this was their solution.  The effects on economic activity don't stop with simply being able to have an economy, though.  >The IDF encourages most officers to pursue a civilian career after the completion of military service. This practice promotes a high rate of turnover in IDF leadership ranks while keeping the military closely tied to the civilian world.  Note that countries which have separation between military and civilian do not need to keep the military "closely tied to the civilian world".  But Israel is not a country with that sort of separation, even though it wants the rest of the world to see it that way.  >One distinct advantage to having such a large number of civilian reservists serving throughout the IDF is that their presence helps counter concerns about Israels transformation into a militarized garrison state.  The percentage of its soi-disant civilian population which is actually in the army is so great that, not just in this current situation but as a matter of course which demands policy to accommodate the fact,  >the large-scale mobilization of reservists for protracted military operations has proven severely disruptive to Israels economy and society. The diversion of much of the countrys workforce causes serious labor shortages in certain sectors, a decline in economic activity due to a loss of markets and clients, and abrupt changes in the supply and demand for various products....These financial burdens are so great that, until recently, any widespread mobilization of reservists almost required Israel to go to war soon thereafter since the civilian economy would collapse under their prolonged absence.  Countries that collapse economically when their "reservists" are called to war are not civilian countries.  Israel would not be able to make as much political hay out of the deaths of its occupying population, if they called their "reservists" by a unique name befitting what these less-active soldiers actually do.  They do serve in the actual army one month out of twelve.  They don't just go for training.  In  >2001, reservists comprised approximately one-third of the Israeli troops in the West Bank and roughly 15 percent of the troops in the Gaza Strip.  12 tranches of "reservists" cycle through those locations in a year.  In the West Bank, that means that in the West Bank, 6x as many, and in Gaza, more than 2x as many, "reservists" see action as the "active" military in any given year.  In October 2005,  >when most of the regular army became preoccupied with Israels disengagement from the Gaza Strip, some 95 percent of enlisted reservists participated in security activities in the occupied territories.  This is not a "civilian" population by definition.  In any given year, a reservist is not a full time civilian.  In any given year, if they are not called up for longer, it is a matter of luck, not a matter of classification.  The fiction that "reserve" and "civilian" mean the same thing in Israel as they do in other countries is perpetuated by Israel and by uncritical, regurgitating western media alike, and so people believe the claim.  But like many of Israel's PR moves, the untruth goes all the way down to the core of the lie: it's in the abuse and deformation of the very meaning of words.

That fear level was never lifted. And yes, the people who are europeans like me notice, and shake heads.   And in the same vein that this created, once a populace is fear crazed, rational arguments end. Simple as that.   A side issue I watch is the so called "girls measurements". Like, how you usually smile when a girl shows you 5 inches with her hands, and goes, that is 8 inches, right? You KNOW what caused this. And you know how to fix this. IT is not by suspecting, it is not by giving context, or throwing a hot take, it is by taking a measuring tape, rolling  off six inches, and readjusting her hands. Just letting it settle what is ACTUALLY 6 inches, and what that means. Letting HER figure out the implications.   The same with the word riot and insurrection. I chose this speciffically because it mirrors.   For the right wing, I can go, you think fergusson was a riot? you would scream if i showed you what happens when paris looses. Fergusson, by comparison, was the mildest of the mild riots. That was the riot you send the rookie cops to.   For the left, 6/1? Try it was a sit in, the same sort like AOC organised. Only it was led by a bunch of dads.   Try watching the Arab spring pictures. Try watching the euromaidan. That is a revolution / an insurrection.   Now, look back to america.   YOu react to this like it's an ACTUAL insurrection. Or an ACTUAL riot. And whenever people point out, hey, you could actually walk this back, you know...  It is imperative that you protect the narrative.   BY the way....  I have allways maintained that school shootings are comparatively the kindest, most nicest outcome, from a mathematical standpoint.   Because all the other results... they produce more injured.   YOu wanna be horrified? Take a school shooter. Give him his dads gun, 200 rounds of ammo... most likely, he will get 120 injured, tops. People move, get out of the way, shoo out.... Moving targets are very hard to hit.   Now, think back to the days of the unabomber. Think one of those school shooters actually thinks, hum, how could I get that killcount higher? Lets go away from someone figuring out how to make that building collapse. That shit can be done.  THink that school shooter pays attention in chemistry, and with the fire alert system. Think a school shooter that calculates in the behavior during a fire alert in.   Think, he sets off one bomb, a weak one, lots oif smoke, and watches everyone file out of the building. go across the rescue ways, collect at the collecting places....   Think that school shooter then detonates his improvsed explosive devices. Which he placed there.   I can guarantee with that tactic, we are not looking at 20 dead, we are looking at scores and scores dead, dying, screaming their lungs out in pain. With the cameras rolling. Even if you got medics around the corner, the possibility would exist of any medical help just being overwhelmed with the number of victims.   as I said.... IF I wanted to injure as many people as possible, I would not need special equipment....or a gun. All I would need is 50 bucks at the DIY store and 10 minutes alone with the cleaning supply room, and I am easily writing tripple digit injnured and dying.   Compared to this, guns are kind. The shooter tires, misses, is out of shape, never has done that stuff before, starts aiming wrong, demo effect, he makes mistakes....I hope that I am wrong, but after seeing the young ones complain so bitterly....

Even assuming you are privileged enough to be able to avoid eating meat and dairies and develop a permanent alternative diet (which in some societies is borderline impossible), the real change will not come about through the complete abandonment of a meat based diet, especially if it is approached as an individual choice and a valid reason for ostracising. If you can, want to and feel the moral imperative to abandon meat consumption then more power to you, but an omnivorous lifestyle by itself is not what's destroying the environment nor the cause of unnaturally prolonged suffering of farm animals. Rather, the structural and radical reform of food distribution, living conditions of edible animals and societal attitude towards daily intake of meat is what needs to happen in order for conditions to improve, and in my opinion it would also increase the overall number of people who become vegan. I have several friends who just wanted to reduce the amount of meat they ate on a monthly basis and gradually became vegans simply because they realised they didn't enjoy meat as much as they had been conditioned to.

For the people at the top, that is.  The USSR was not an empire and no serious and sane capitalist thinks that. I won't pretend like every decision the Soviets and the Chinese did during the last century was good. Because plenty weren't, but still plenty were. And even if they did everything right, it might not have been enough still. Because a competitor who's aim is to better the lives of their people is going to have a nightmare of a time dealing with a competitor who has no problem from extracting everything from their people (and even more from those occupied imperial provinces) just to throw it at the first guy in the hopes of maintaining their own power and wealth.  I know it can be a meme, but every time we discuss politics and historical events we need to see what material conditions led to them, maintained them and changed them.  Cuba had a communist revolution changing the country from a fascist state very friendly with the USA full of plantation barons and those slaveowners then fled mainly to florida and became a big part of the conservative anticommunist votes there. The USA proceeded to try assassinating Castro dozens of times, militarily and economically bullied Cuba. Invaded it. Embargoed it (for decades now any ship that docks a Cuban port can't trade with the USA for a year and has to pay $100.000.000 in "damages" if they used "ports illegally seized by the Cuban government in the '60s"). Opened a blacksite prison for torturing anybody they want because they just label them an enemy combatant and a terrorist and not a normal citizen. You might now figure out why Cuba hasn't made it big on the international stage economically. Even still, it manages to have an amazing doctor system (which is also of course non stop sabotaged by the USA).  North Korea completely bombed to rubble by the USA. So bloodthirsty were the americans that even after dropping more bombs on it then were dropped in the entire WWII (sans the nuclear bombs) some US generals even wanted to top it off with a nuke. Then they installed a fascist government in South Korea (fascism is the best friend of capitalism it seems), embargoed North Korea and all the time floats its battleships, jet carriers and submarines along it's cost just to bully haunt them as much as possible.The isolation of North Korea might not have been it's best decision, but it is very much understandable because the actions of the west. You can constantly read online how ridiculous and evil things are in N. korea, especially from the S. Korean government and "totally unbought and homest defectors". Then you read how the same defectors say exactly opposite and contradictory things some time later.  Vietnam was similarity firebombed to hell because they dared to communism. And they managed to survive somehow. Now they see that a compromise with the west is needed because otherwise they will be massacred again.  Yugoslavia had it's own flavour of communism. Their curse was they were in between. Had to be as as neutral as possible as to survive. Im from the Balkan. Im not saying that it was all the west's fault for destroying Yugoslavia. But ethnic tensions is also a good friend of capitalism. It's dissolution was a great boon for the west, damn the lives of people who ended up worse in exchange.  US backed fascists in Indonesia massacred a million (1.000.000!!) people. Presumed communists and communist sympathizers....   The isolatiom of East Germany towards the west was Stalin's attempt to guard it from capitalism and fascism. He was plenty paranoid, that's a fact. But can you blame him. Look at how many assassination attempts Castro survived. It was a try. Of course it couldn't have lasted om the border with the west. The USA embraced thousands of Nazis, and turned Germany into it's right hand of imperialism and world policing. That's so much better.  And yes, western capitalist countries only won the cold war because of the exploitation of the global south, and it's own citizens of course. No cost to high in fighting the red menace!

Because it has been the result of Congress slowly ceding its own power to the President (by the way, Im mostly talking about war powers and Presidents being able to involve us in forever-wars with no consent of Congress).   In my opinion, it **is** an either or situation. Why would we use up so much press, so much air time talking about the **obviously** pointless venture of trying to impeach President Trump? For all his enemies, he still has quite a few supporters, namely in the Senate. We would *never* be able to achieve the 60 vote threshold to successfully impeach President Trump. Its a waste of political energy, when we could do it the plurality way in only a year. The House could file impeachment proceedings and sure, it would likely pass. But Leader McConnell would hush it out as quickly as it came to the floor.  President Trump has likely violated the constitution in an amalgam of ways. But mind you, even as a Democrat, Obamas sweeping EO on DACA was *likely* unconstitutional as well, even coming from somebody who supports permanent status for DACA recipients. With a primary season so close, I just think its pointless for Democrats now to involve themselves in a pointless press circus to impeach the President. That would take away so, so much quality air time from worthy candidates. We should spend that air time telling Americans that this or that candidate will do better than Trump, and heres how.

Insofar as the state recognizes marriage, it should only be between a man and woman. If the state would prefer to abandon "marriage the sexual union" in favour of "marriage the domestic contract" that would also be fine with me, but most countries are now in a fundamentally immoral in-between. If it's simply a domestic contract then it should be available to anyone, such as an adult child caring for an elderly relative.  This is basically my position on the matter. Couldnt have said it better myself!  Ideally abortion of all kinds would be illegal, though in view of political practicality I'm willing to accept the usual exceptions in favour of banning 99% of abortions. I oppose the death penalty not fundamentally, but insofar as it no longer serves any real protective purpose and cuts off a life that could have ended in repentance.  Youve articulated my position of abortion as well, though I would also include tight regulations on IVF and stemcell research to make sure we are not killing and experimenting on living human persons. I would also say that war crimes and terrorism should warrant the death penalty, but this is far from a set in stone opinion.  My main point of disagreement comes from your below points. I am not nearly as socially permissive, but I do agree the role of the state should be limited encouragement rather then enforcement, although I admit Im far from sure about how this would work. I would definitely add that there should be far more stringent regulations on pornography, including sex and lewd images in advertising and tv. Basically, anything that wouldnt be legal to do out on the street shouldnt be legal on public television. Otherwise, obviously criminal penalties shouldnt brought forth, but I think the municipal government, being more down to earth and organic anyway, should be allowed to form organic relationships with the church.

There are different ways of being abnormal or insane, and abnormal and/or insane people can, and sometimes certainly do, oppose eachother.

Thats like saying we shouldnt have any laws because well then everything will be illegal eventually. Thats nonsense and terrible logic.   And yes, not properly storing guns and then your own kids shooting themselves or others should be manslaughter at a minimum.  There have also been a ton of studies about suicide and easy access to firearms increases it dramatically especially among males.   All of these things are tied in together with one factor being the common denominator, and its easy access to guns.   Its harder to get a drivers license than it is a gun in a lot of states.  We have licenses for cars, why not federally with guns? We also have to have insurance for houses and cars, why not guns?   It would also be way safer for the police if the general public didnt have as easy access to guns. This whole we can have as many guns as we want is a newer idea to America and were seeing the literal deadly results of that.

Repeated, court sanctified, hard to argue with embarrassments for the guy are just as likely to hamper enthusiasm among supporters.   If you look at the primaries there's already shrinking enthusiasm and support for him. Haley dropped out months ago. She's still regularly pulling 10-20% of primary voters where she's on the ballot.  Likewise I don't know how it's just a shrug on turnout for the DNC. Frustration around lack of consequences for Trump or progress on any of the cases is high among DNC voters. This is some fucking progress and consequences.  I find it frustrating that everything will supposedly drive a MAGA turnout frenzy. It's the first thing news media jumps to, and we constantly hear how holding the dude accountable will only backfire.  Didn't happen when we impeached him twice.

It only takes a million man hours to audit a million people and they may get $100 per man hour. But million man hours auditing billionaires would likely turn into $1,000 (or more) per man hour.

Its not cynicism, its just fact  Ogilvie and Mather were contracted by BP to devise a method to pass the buck on responsibility for emissions whilst appearing to take responsibility, and they came up with Carbon Footprint. Its disinformation. A simple search will reveal this.  The reason we cant calculate it down the individual with any clarity or detail is because thats not how emissions are counted in the first place. Emissions mostly arent counted at all  they are estimated from a total, then averaged to a per capita figure, and we have little idea whats been included in or excluded from that figure. Industry reports it itself, based on rules they lobbied governments to write favourably to themselves.   If you take an electric train, public transport style, how much of the emissions are allocated to you as an individual? We estimate a number for one trip, divide it by the amount of the trip you took, divided by the number of riders. +/- some number for daily changes in conditions, if its winter, etc.   Do we factor in the emissions of the plow that cleared the snow from the line so the train could travel? The maintenance crews that take care of the lines? The fuel source of the electricity itself? Do we allocate that to the rider? If there were 10 people in the train one day and 200 the next, what figure is right?  And on and on. Repeat this for everything, and the issue of footprint is clearly designed to create noise and confusion surrounding emissions, and to make a simple problem into a giant one.  Yet every company can tell you how much fuel they bought and burned. Emission to make the train. Average ridership. Its in their budgets and their stats. Why do this extra step and pass the debt onto the consumer?  The simplest approach is to tackle it at the level of production. Energy emissions produced by the energy sector is an easily-determined figure. (Theres still the self-reporting versus inspections issue, though.) Individual use of that energy on the customer side is vastly more complex to determine  plus, 60% of the energy created simply dissipates. Who is responsible for that? Or do we divvy it up per capita into footprint? But its the grid itself that is wasteful, not the consumer.  Footprint truly has almost no meaning.  Then add all the deliberate misinformation. Like, going paperless is often heralded as an environmentally sound approach. It is not. Laptop-based education, for example  Dell publishes stats, production, for their laptops. One laptop is the equivalent emissions of about 114 years of school work worth of paper and pencil emissions. And a student will typically acquire three laptops between grades 7 and first year university alone. 6-8 years of school for 350 years of relative excess carbon debt. The emissions debt of technology is _vastly worse_ than the environmental impact of paper milling.   Or electric cars  to manufacture and operate _one_ electric car, the emissions profile is the same as running a traditional petroleum fuelled vehicle for about 25 years, using todays emissions standards. And it involves mining rare earth elements, usually in open pit mines, extracted with caustic chemicals and those elements are single use, generally, as the cost to recycle them is astronomical.  Oh, and dont forget that recycling itself has an emissions profile and costs energy. Do we factor that into footprint?  Or take all those bamboo fabric products, marketed as sustainable  its really rayon, one of the most polluting synthetic fibres there is. Its called sustainable because bamboo is a faster growing source of cellulose than trees, meaning you can make more rayon, meaning you can pollute _more_. Theres nothing green about it at all.  There is so much murkiness in this because of advertising claims that are actual demonstrable bullshit. And footprint turns out to be one of those things that is actual, demonstrable bullshit.  Its a waste of time, and IMO if were going to get anywhere at all on addressing climate change we have to drop the idea of footprint completely. Its literally disinformation.

This is evident in the UK leaving the EU, Texas with the US, and Alberta with Canada. This is what Danielle Smith is trying to tap into.   Have populist politicians support policies that cause chaos and issues in our society. Populist politicians are tapping into these information warfare campaigns to appeal to people whose only access to information about the outside world around them is through social media, where the information warfare is taking place.   Cause distrust and havoc, by creating specialized propaganda to different segments of the population spread through social media. By polarizing debates through propaganda spread to the masses, Russia has effectively used information warfare to deliver targeted disinformation and appeal to specific demographics. Causing havoc in the LBGT and other minority communities.   Russia has effectively infiltrated the religious right in America and Canada and empowered them, among many corrupt leaders worldwide through its information warfare.  I can cite my sources if needed.  Putin literally bombed his own people to lock down his power and control. Why should we trust that he is not carrying out horrible atrocities like using information warfare on Canadian citizens to terrorize the LGBT community? He doesn't seem to have any moral qualms with anything and corruption is part of his shtick. He used a nerve agent to publicly poison a turned intelligence asset at a important time in history to signify to his intelligence assets what can be done to them, but in reality, he is just a weak man, who is bitter about the break up of the empire he devoted his life to.  It you want to know more, there is a great documentary series on Netflix about the history that has led to this moment in time. Turning Point - The Bomb and the Cold War on Netflix.

They're called "Bibists", since "Bibi" is his nickname here and how everyone usually refers to him here.  Personally I didn't like mainly the fact that he was just in office for way too long. Also him being literally accused for bribery, fraud and breach of trust wasn't great, alongside his connection to far right-wingers. For me it felt like this country was divided into the half that loved Bibi/tolerated him bc they were fine with his political opinions and connections, and those who opposed him and wanted him gone ASAP. I have another comment here that explains it more deeply.

In this vast freshwater ocean lived a very simple plant (Azolla) or duck weed as you might know it today. 14 different species of Azolla thrived in this massive fresh water ocean and as a result it eventually covered 30 million square kilometres! During that period co2 was roughly 1000 ppm but give Azolla enough time and it essentially cooled the planet by drawing up 400ppm and in doing so killed itself off.  This Azolla eventually became the oil that will kill us off too if this project goes ahead.  Even something as small and simple as duckweed + time = global collapse.

However if we want to make the comparison its apt to say that the British are an example of messing things up horribly, getting found out, altering their ways and becoming well respected as a result (even though certain units were always very well respected for their abilities internationally) and all while the British government managed to sign a peace agreement with a nation with terrorists ostensibly in power politically.

No country is owned and given to anyone.  Jews did not magically appear out of thin air. Using that logic Africans are the original inhabitants of Israel and everywhere else because mankind originated from Southern Africa. Does this give South Africans claim to the world? Because you, me and everyone else came from Africa and our ancestors spread across Pangea when all the continents were connected.   There were people living in the land known as Israel, no shit. How else would Judaism have formed. Do you think Jews came from plant matter?  A group of them formed together to create a religion followed by a nation (Ethnoreligion). I am not sure how that would be different to any other ethnicity other than the fact that Jews did so a very long time ago, before Christianity and Islam. Did all the inhabitants of that region decide to become Jewish, was there conflict or conquest during the formation. Who knows, historical archives dont seem to point to Jews conquering the land so it seems to have happened organically **hence they were the first to create an ethnicity attached to the land.** Do you understand that is what an ethnicity is? A group of people naming themselves to a geographical location.  Most other countries have a much darker past with regards to their formation. The Jews then got colonised and for all intents and purposes the creation of Israel is an example of decolonization returning the land to indigenous people something the left advocate for apparently unless its for Jews in which case it's bad. boo.

I guess the main point of disagreement is the degree to which the current fossil economy can be replaced by a non-fossil based one, and how fast such a change is happening.  Sure, there is some degree of increase in the production of renewable energy, but society is still completely dependent on fossils. And the speed of change is painstakingly low.  Also carbon capture technology has proved out to be very challenging to engingeer or scale up.  Humans sure have been around for a long time, but we have only had advanced technology for a short period. It is less than a 100 years since we invented transistors, and only a bit more than that for the internal combustion engine. For example.

Nobody can force rail workers to work: they can always quit. The only real leverage the government has is economic: if you quit, youll lose your healthcare, your shelter, and then starve.  Remember that its the Republicans who, for years now, have been using every economic device they can to push those exact levers to force people back to work at low wages: turning down federal aid to their own citizens, blocking hikes to the minimum wage and access to subsidized healthcare, slashing unemployment insurance and safety nets, tightening requirements for any sort of aid. Its not being forced to work a job you hate at the point of a gun, but its as close as they can get.  And Biden, for all his faults, isnt Republican.  If I was in his shoes Id want to make it very clear to the rail operators that their $22B is very much on the line here. The American People have been extraordinarily generous to the railroads since there _were_ railroads- initially railroads were granted free land along any tracks they built: 50 miles _on either side_ of the tracks at first (a checkerboard pattern after that). The rights of way were exceedingly valuable for other purposes. (The first three letters of long-distance company Sprint stands for Southern Pacific Railway).   Congress could make it clear that, if the railroads dont play nice, that any largesse is over. Oh: not using that rail? Well take it and reallocate it to someone who will.

These seemingly endless run-ins with the law arent cheap; it costs money to retain lawyers, even when they arent of the highest quality.  The result is that over the course of 2023, the Trump campaign and affiliated political action committees spent around $50 million on the legal defense of the former president and others in his orbit, The New York Times reported.  In his attempt to avoid dipping into his own funds, Trump is drawing primarily on money from his Save America PAC to pay his ever-mounting legal fees. Hes also spending cash from the Make America Great Again PAC, the current incarnation of his 2020 re-election committee.  The costs Trump faces are only going to go up as the year goes on, along with his ability to afford time off the campaign trail.  **Read more here:** [https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-trials-50-million-legal-fees-rcna136594](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-trials-50-million-legal-fees-rcna136594)

Where could they possibly even store all that aid? Also, if Israel is so confident that its Hamas stealing the aid, why doesnt Israel just protect the aid from Hamas with their tanks? Israel has shown it has no problem moving their tanks throughout Gaza to kill children, why cant they protect this aid?   No one actually has to engage with any of your obviously bullshit fantasies because pretty much all aid and humanitarian groups still left of the ground say its Israel thats blocking the aid. Theres been no evidence presented either by Israel or anyone else that Hamas stealing aid is a significant road block to feeding starving Palestinians. The problem is Israel. Perhaps there would be more evidence of Hamas stealing aid if Israel actually allowed outside journalists and investigators in, and hadnt already murdered all the journalists in Gaza and their families.

With a large percentage of renewables on (or coming soon) to grids, the idea of base load in that there is one flat level of demand that is best sourced from one energy source actually kind of dies. Basically, when renewables are generating max output, you dont really want to have to run your base load generator at all, because thats just more energy than is needed, but when renewables wane over the day/night, you want to fire up your base load power source to supplement. This changing demand is called net load. Its literally just power demand - renewables supply.   Turns out nuclear plants are very good at generating one specific level of power all day and not very good at ramping up or ramping down their power output. Thats a bad net load source, instead you want something that acts more like a natural gas plant (or, more ideally an enhanced geothermal plant or something low carbon).   Theres a great episode of the Volts podcast that goes into this specific concept of base load vs net load titled The extraordinary potential value of enhanced geothermal power from September 30 of this year.

A big part of understanding US policy revolves around recognizing one fundamental truth:  **The United States is a TRADE POWER.**  TL;DR upfront: The US is an economic superpower first, and is motivated to maximize the stability and security of the world because an *unstable* world is bad for trade. The world's business is, literally, the US' business.  -----  The US, throughout its history, has been *driven by trade.* Whether as a natural resource extractor, an industrial hub, or service economy, the main mover and shaker of American politics has economic prosperity - "Is my bank account bigger under this guy?" That's a really surface-level summary of the American zeitgeist, but it's still useful for broad strokes. It suffices to say that America's strategic national interest is in generating as much trade as possible so that it can profit directly or indirectly - this colors how the US interacts with the world as a whole.   We see, time and time again, that the US doesn't *really* stand for "spreading freedom and democracy." The US has propped up dictators and despots *when convenient,* as is frequently opined by "America Bad" voices. But, convenient for what? Convenient for *stability.* The US' driving strategic interest is in maintaining a **stable world for trade,** because the US stands the most to gain business is flowing smoothly. That means that when anything comes up that might *stop* business from being done, it's in the US' interest to resolve the situation quickly and cleanly.   Take a look at any small brushfire wars in the last 50 years the US didn't get involved in - odds are, it's because it was an *exclusively* regional affair that didn't have any risk of spillover into the international market (or because getting involved would risk a direct conflict with the USSR - also bad for business). But this doesn't just apply to war: the US throws its soft power around to influence global market direction, political developments in critical countries, and even global disaster recovery. Turns out that people who are homeless and starving don't make great customers - helping them get back on their feet so they can get back to spending is a good long-term investment.  With the Middle East, the problem is it's such a fucking mess that *any* issue threatens to upend the whole region, which *inconveniently* is critical for the existence of the modern economy. Not only the trade routes that crisscross it, but the oh-so-vital oil that runs modern human energy requirements. It's frequently cited that the US doesn't actually get all that much oil from the Middle East - but the *rest of the world, who the US trades with*, does. If factories in China grind to a halt because they're out of fuel, because Iran is having a spat with Saudi and blockading the Strait of Hormuz, that is a critical concern for the US!  That's why the US sticks its nose into things that, on their face, don't seem like their business. Because the world's business *is* the US' business.

If you read the Tanakh, it tells the story of how the Israelites originally claimed the "Promised Land": Through a decades long campaign of genoicdal murder-arson-slaver-rapery of the people who were already living there; deliberately targeting women and children for extra-brutal treatment.  Of course, there are many big problems with every attempt to use this as a justification for treating modern Jewish people badly, foremost among which being:  * The Christians claim these atrocities directly by incorporating them wholesale into the Old Testament and affirming them in the New. * The Muslims claim this even *more* directly by claiming that they are the *true* heirs of the Torah, and actual Jews as impostors who appropriated it after the fact. * Modern Judaism is, by contrast, *very reluctant* to claim them, and has centuries of scholarship coming up with excuses for why the circumstances which allegedly made *those* genocides morally justified could never ever ever apply again. * The historical record makes it pretty clear that none of those events ever happened in the first place. * Even if we take it as read that they *did* happen, they would have happened roughly *three thousand years ago*, so at best it makes about as much sense as blaming modern Greek people for the fall of Troy.

The only viable large-scale alternative out here, for the foreseeable future, is nuclear, with some help from renewables.

This is in addition to many recent years with cumulative winter heat records.  Millions of years of moderate weather changes allowed a precariously balanced ecosystem to thrive. 200 years of human induced climate change is unraveling this faster than the big dinosaur die-off some 150 million years ago (let alone the smaller one 50 million years ago). Since 1970, half of all animal species and 2/3 of all animal specimens have disappeared from Earth. And no matter what we do (even if all humans were to suddenly vanish from Earth today) this trend would accelerate for decades to come.

In a lot of ecosystems the soil is the largest carbon pool, so any kind of disruption to the system (e.g. deforestation, tillage, trawling) can result in huge emissions as microbes gain access to previously locked away carbon pools or plants are no longer able to take it up as fast as the microbes can emit it. This is definitely the case in temperate grasslands and basically the entire boreal and Arctic portions of the globe.  So I dont have a definitive answer but its a ton. The definitive (or best possible - its an area of active research) answer is probably in the SOCR-2 report or the IPCC AR6 report.

Most of the tax increases under the Biden admin are for corporations and top income earners making more than $400,000 a year, a progressive tax rate meant to offset the $1.9 trillion the gov will lose in revenue over 10 years thanks to the Trump admins regressive tax plan. If you make less than $400,000, under the Biden plan, you would actually see on average an even higher tax cut than the Trump admin said they would do but actually didnt do.

However on the flip side I find combining energy for transport etc and energy for electricity also a bit disingenuous. They are two different sectors and decarbonisation is very different for each.   Are they though? Transport, heating, electricity are the largest emission sectors.   Transport includes most modern rail and EVs. Heating is now being supplied more and more by heat pumps, space heaters, and air conditioners. Clearly electricity *can* replace those sectors, and is in the process of it.  The main issue is that global warming doesn't care if we divide these things, and when the media & governments focus so much on "70% electric" they are burying the reality that we are absolutely nowhere close to solving this issue.  >Admittedly New York as a whole has higher emissions due to transport (22% compared to 17%), focusing a particular project on decarbonising the grid alone is much more effective than trying to cover all energy sources.  How we're handling it should be done in an efficient way, but how we talk about global warming shouldn't. Half the people I meet think we're 20-70%  done with solving global warming.  They read "70% clean electricity" and think we're 70% done. Reality is that since the renewable energy wave we have only converted 3% of all energy generation into solar & wind.

When I say representative demographics, it would typically mean that team members within whichever group should by default closely represent the local or national demographics. i.e. if there are 30% brown hair people, then it would be a gold standard to have a min. 30% brown hair people. If this standard is not met, then there is something ill, wrong, or indecent.  This makes me think you're referring to it as a prescription.  >What do I mean by unreasonable, there has been, to my knowledge, NO institution that has had a population that is representative of the population. When looking at police officer demographics in NY during the 1900's there was a dipropionate number of Irish-Americans. In Hawaii during ww2, a disproportionate amount of labor was conducted by Japanese-Americans. A disproportionate amount of army officers are asian. Not to mention looking at sports demographics. There were not programs or institutions dedicated to creating those differences, they just happened.  But this makes me think you're referring to it as a description.  As a description, I don't think you'll find much resistance. Most people, even those that support affirmative action programs, would agree. But they might assign different causes for this observation. That's where the prescription becomes relevant.  If you think the situation is caused by coincidence (independent individuals having independent reactions to environments), then it is probably morally permissible. However, if the situation is caused by unjustified discrimination, whether institutional or individual, then most people likely would believe it is morally not permissible. Of course there can be discussions on the best way to do address the situation, but that's a separate conversation.

Spreads the social cost out over everyone. Instead of some arbitrary measure based on CEO/board pay being redistributed to employees, we simply tax Jeff Bezos' actual income along with everyone else's. It's just more fair in general  2. Income taxes are much, much easier to administrate than complex regulatory frameworks  3. Taxes don't distort the good parts of the free market nearly as much as forcing every company to pay a fake wage (here meaning a wage significantly above the market price for labor in a given sector). If you make every firm in the country pay someone $30/hr minimum, then anything below that is going to have to drastically adjust whether it's prices, employee numbers, or going out of business.  In contrast to minimum wage, taxes are based on income and not just a firm's need for workers. Income taxes don't make the actual cost of business higher, and they allow people to be employed at sensible market rates for the difficulty of work/supply of labour.  The general principle I'm driving at here is that it seems more straightforward to use the government for this job (since arguably that's government's purpose in the first place) instead of making employers responsible for the entire well-being of the people who happen to work for them. By having the government take care of people to a minimum standard, we can leave the market to do what it does best (essentially, distribution efficiency)  Now while I'm against minimum wage or think it should be relatively low (preferring more government welfare and more unions), there are definitely arguments out there for more modest increases. Minimum wage in it's best form basically just prevents outright abuses and is pegged to *localities*. My area would be destroyed by a $15 minimum wage, but New York City could likely absorb it just fine. I'm more concerned here with the idea of basically tying everyone's welfare to their job when I think we have a better way of doing it  > What would be your ideal tax code?  I don't know what numbers specifically, that's above my paygrade, but a simple progressive income tax without all of the nonsense deductions we have now. Zero corporate income tax and increases in personal taxes across the board, much moreso on the highest income brackets of course. Also add more brackets.  I wouldn't punish outsourcing since protectionism basically never works out in the long term economically. Comparative advantage and trade is good for everyone in the world, and results in cheaper goods and the very high standard of living that the poor enjoy now compared to 200 (or even 100) years ago.

You can always blame the bad faith actors but there are always bad faith actors.  We could've developed an electric pod car, single seat with another single seat behind it doubling as cargo space w/ 25mph top speed and a ~30 mile range almost a century ago.  A vehicle like that is sufficient for short range 1 or 2 passenger commutes and most commutes are short range 1 or 2 passenger commutes.  Install park and rides near highway ramps where you'd park your pod car and rent a normal car or take a bus or train for longer distance commutes.  When you get to where you're going get off at another park and ride and rent another pod car.  This has been possible for nearly a century.  Since cars are ~20% of emissions this would reduced total emissions by 15%+.  It'd also have meant much less airborne plastic pollution from car tires since pod cars only weight ~100-200lbs instead of 3000lbs+.  It's also have spared lots of road deaths, property damage, and lead poisoning.  We could still do it.  It's still a big part of the solution.  The future is walking or biking, it's pod cars.  People don't bike because biking means risking the elements, maybe getting sweaty, and dodging cars.  Given a switch to pod cars cities could eventually ban all but emergency vehicles or cars of people with special permits and switch over half their road and parking space to whatever else.  Also activists have badly dropped the ball on housing.  Since forever the USA has had odious zoning laws that have effectively blocked sustainable dense housing.  Most places in the USA won't even let you build a tiny home on your own lot.  Activists should've gotten together and started their own town long ago without such odious zoning.  Then we'd have a refuge as well as a place to hold up as an example of what's supposed to be.  Then it'd catch on other places and we'd have gotten change long ago.  Oh and we should all be vegan, there's no such thing as a sincere environmentalist who isn't.  And we should've been promoting plant based diets to the masses.  Not the faux meat stuff but simple cheap healthy stuff like oatmeal.  But instead activists have focused on telling people what's bad or what not to do instead of focusing on actually doing what they ought to be doing instead.  Aside from this giving the public a bad impression of activists it also means activism doesn't return financially and this means activists have to have other jobs or be supported by donations and get burnt out.  Whereas were activists focused on things like building/selling pod cars and building/moving to activist towns they'd be creating wealth and be less dependent on the very system they seek to change.  I would've been doing this stuff the past 3 decades had my family not raped me into oblivion to the point my mind just noped out of this hell.  So it could be it's not really our fault, maybe we've been getting mass raped.  That'd be one more reason we need to create a refuge of our own.

See below.  "Inadequate analgesia can be come a suicidogen" (this is known, this is not the only source for that info).  This response can fall out of the patient's control.   Craving as a state of being doesn't matter.  Yes it's physically uncomfortable but to weigh it against pain relief of nerve pain, and find that nerve pain is preferable to experiencing craving, is a moral judgment.  Diabetics crave insulin, especially when they can't get it due to insurance failures here in the states, but also when they are crashing.  And pain patients *crave* relief, 24/7, for *years*.  You have no idea.    Why is that craving not something that the clinical industry is very averse to?  I think it is because, culturally, "to suffer is man's lot", and to become physically used to an exogenous substance is judged morally impure: the ascetic mentality.  Tolerance: that's the legitimate problem, because people need to keep increasing their dose, until they are on the edge between controlling the pain necessary to live, yet the dose is dangerous.  I'm looking at that oxy/naloxone prescription in the image above when I say that.  I will say that tolerance has not been robustly addressed, however, a panoply of methods do exist both for peri-operative and chronic pain situations.  At this moment and going forward, whatever judgments the industry is in the habit of passing due to tolerance, and whatever dismissals or refusals they are used to using as a first line response, they should instead spend the effort needed to maintain those mental bulwarks to get up to speed on the tolerance reduction adjuncts and start implementing them.  It's a moral obligation.

Many patients properly treated for prolonged periods with opioids develop tolerance and subsequently, physical dependence. This process is not necessarily harmful to the patient and will not cause the patient to develop an addiction (properly defined as psychologic dependence). For many patients who have been on opioid therapy for months or years, analgesic effectiveness tragically becomes less.      inadequate analgesia can become a suicidogen, ie, any factor that causes a patient to want to commit suicide. Incorporation of adjuncts to opioid therapy can serve to lessen pain and improve quality of life for a suffering patient.

Reduced agricultural use of water, more efficient agriculture, agriculture goes away.   From the latest Colorado river water usage report that came out sometime earlier this year: Of the 23 or so percent of the Colorado river watershed that Colorado receives, 95% of that portion was consumed by agriculture. The other 5% is all we people and our homes, yards, and such.   Municipalities, businesses, developers all purchase water rights away from farm land so they can build/grow. It will just continue and ag will shrink and fade to match the growing population and reduced overall output of the watershed. (It'll probably max out and start shrinking at the end of this century if we can't stop climate change, but too early to tell, really.)   Agriculture in the high plains never made sense anyway, not really. There are limited crops that thrive, a weird growing season that is getting worse.   It only ever took off because the government and subsets like Reclamation wanted homesteaders to "Go west, young man." They were convinced that "the water would follow the plough." That somehow because we started planting crops, the climate would magically change to make it possible to grow and sustain them.   The federal government subsidized cheap water so heavily for over a century, it made fiscal sense for growers to grow here rather than in climates that are designed to grow food.   The sooner we all realize that type of expansion that took place in the west wasn't ever sustainable, the sooner we can and will adapt, and decide if and how human life will continue to thrive out here.   In way too many words, that's likely how climate refugees will, at least for a time, live here.

On June 8, the FBI emailed Trump's lawyers, telling them to put a stronger lock on the basement and to keep all documents "preserved in that room in their current condition until further notice" due to the ongoing investigation.  June 22, following intelligence reports, the FBI subpoenaed video surveillance footage, which showed that, *after* the FBI asked Trump to have the location secured with additional locks, members of his team moved boxes out of the bathroom.

We just don't have a voice, because the Democrats smash anything further left than Biden. It's the "triangulation" or, "middle way". Centerists sound good on paper, the "best of both worlds" but, at least in America the reality is that centerists are just right wing. I posit that to make the changes the progressive left wants, major power shifts needs to occur within society. Specifically, to address homelessness, landlords can't be the to set rent prices, access to healthcare won't be possible without disempowering, hospitals, insurance companies and untying access to medical insurance to employment.  None of these power imbalances can be addressed by centerists because centerists want to maintain the power structures, with perhaps small tweaks. However, small tweaks don't have the capacity to deal with the massive power imbalance, especially because any of the small tweaks offered by centerists can be clawed back later, when public eyes are off them.  Small concessions being clawed back has already happened with the affordable care act. Specifically, it's apparent with colonoscopies. The ACA dictates all colonoscopies are to be free, with the intention that people can get colonoscopies to catch cancer in it's infancy. However, *if*  the colonoscopy finds anything to biopsy, hospitals no longer bill it as a colonoscopy, so suddenly the once free procedure can go into thousands of dollars. This is an absolute mockery of what the provision was intended to do, but because we have a for profit medical system and courts which prioritize the rights of companies above people, this is now both a legal and widespread practice.  Us, those with a leftist view, need to split from the Dems. Democrats cannot, and will not ever, cast away capitalism. Not only has Biden come out and said AOC does not represent the future of the party, but in court from the 2016 DNC primary, the DNC argued it is a private entity, and thus does not need to follow the will of the people or honor the popular vote when the DNC decides to award the winner of the primary. Lastly, DNC relies on megadonors and the ultra wealthy to sustain itself, so it would not bite the hand that feeds it. Thus, our only real option is to create our own party.

The average reactor was then 29 years old39 in the United States, whose fleet is the worlds largestso its not surprising that in 2020, maintenance or upgrade costs, safety concerns, and often simple operational uncompetitiveness caused owners worldwide to close 5.165 GW. The net nuclear capacity addition was thus the difference, 0.356 GW. Yet in the same year, the world added3 278.3 GW of renewables (or 257 GW without hydropower)782 as much. Adjusted for relative US 2020 average capacity factors4, renewables net additions in 2020 thus raised the worlds annual carbon-free electricity supply by ~232 as much as nuclear powers net additions did. That is, nuclear net growth increased the worlds carbon-free power supply in all of 2020 only as much as renewable power growth did every ~38 hours.   >When nuclear power emerged, from the mid-1950s through the 1960s, US utilitiesvertically integrated, three-fourths private, technically and culturally conservativedidnt want it. Yet powerful Federal actors offered heavily subsidized fuel and let them own it, largely relieved them of accident liability, and ultimately tempted and coerced them into a vast nuclear building spree, under implicit threat of displacing them with Federal nuclear utilities11. During 19552020, US utilities ordered 259 power reactors. The number actually built and run peaked at 112 in 1990, with a straggler begun in 1973 added in 2016. By February 2022, 93 units (95 GW) remained in operation while 40 (19 GW) had been permanently closed. As of mid-2017, only 28 unitssome of them slated for closurehad been built, remained competitive in their regional markets, and had not suffered at least one outage lasting one year or more. In the hydrocarbon industries, 28 successful units out of 259 total orders would be called an 89% dry-hole risk.

Eminent merchant bank Lazard says US advanced nuclear newbuild (a 2.2-GW LWR station) would cost 38 more per MWh than unsubsidized solar or windpower41. Leading empirical-data synthesist Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), tracking more than 24,000 projects actual costs worldwide, says 51342. Even the US Energy Information Administration (expert more in historical data than in technology cost forecasting) says 2 and finds that nuclear cost exceeds value  and  >The more nuclear tries to follow net load (possible within limits, but awkward), the worse its economics. Claiming new market prospects, from process heat to Bitcoin mining71 and marine propulsion to desalination, makes no more sense72 than its vanished main use case for baseload generation73, and no more for small than for big reactors. New use cases cannot remedy uncompetitive electricity costs.  and  >guaranteeing nuclear market share with no demonstration of competitiveness (per MWh or per ton of CO2) compromises climate-effectiveness, and slows the evolution of regional power markets and the clean technologies that win in them. Continuing discussions about new nuclear subsidies, he concludes, are essentially a negotiationabout the size of the ransom that the nuclear industry will be able to extract by slowing down the transition to an electric system that transfers control from large central facilities to the premises [and communities] of the customers.  and  >Nuclear advocates contend that nuclear plants normally steady baseload operation has unrecognized but large economic, reliability, and resilience value deserving special compensation. No evidence has emerged to support this view  and  >Including the costs of grid integration119 (or similarly small grid expansion120) would generally increase nuclear powers cost disadvantage, because big thermal plants typically incur severalfold higher integration costs than wind or solar farms. The reason is simple: modern renewables smaller, briefer, more graceful, and more predictable failures incur far less cost for reserve margin, spinning reserve, and cycling penalties (in lifetime, efficiency, and maintenance cost).  >Empirical evidence, though limited, suggests that grid balancing tends to cost less for wind and PV generation (typically a few $/MWh121) than for big thermal plants122. For example, ERCOTs fast-acting reserves in 2013 cost severalfold more per MWh for thermal than for wind capacity123.  hah  >Nuclear construction now is sometimes said to be essential to ensure that the last 1020% of generation can be decarbonized around the 2030s, because 100% renewable power is said to be impossible or at least unproven. This view is misframed, since the last few percent have little climate consequence, hardly justifying immense investments now, nor slowing the huge renewable deployments needed first. It also rests on selecting some very unconvincing literature while denying the rest. Diverse peer-reviewed studies67 in one recent compilation130, plus many more131find 100% renewable supply is practical and generally advantageous for a wide range of nations and regions, better matches empirical market choices, and needs no nuclear power to minimize cost or carbon.

So we may well see more evapotranspiration and generally drier soils, reduced snowpack, more fires, forest transition to grassland, and other impacts due to high temps, while also getting more precip, but perhaps in less useful amounts/formats - periodic heavy rains with flooding, rain on snow, rain on large burned areas running off,  late/early snow, etc.   To wit on that last one - Front Range broke late snowfall records on the 21st this month. In Sept 2020 we broke early ones, too. Warming doesn't always mean warmer, it often means decrease in stability, like of seasons.   As with Colorado's typical variability in weather, we are not likely to see these changes go lockstep year to year in one direction for 20 years. There will be wetter and cooler ones along the way, too, but the general trend that climate researchers are anticipating is drier and warmer. Take a look at some of the links in this sub's sidebar on Old Reddit or About tab on mobile to get a read on what state planners are anticipating (edit: one of those links was shared by other commenter).  Caveat - I am not a climatologist. I am just synthesizing the general consensus from those projecting for Colorado and the West.

The Native wild yak in the region is highly endangered, with less than 10 000 remaining, because of, among other reasons, inbreeding with and competition for resources with domesticated Yak. Yak Livestock farming is highly destructive to the local ecosystems.  Wild Yak species will not only survive well in the Himalaya (etc) region if humans there stop livestock farming them, all w/o the extra GHG emissions, but in fact would be able to recover from the brink of extinction.   The Yak they raise is domesticated and therefore not a native wild species; its livestock. Its just like european Wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) and domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) are the same species, yet occupy _extremely_ different ecological niches. The European Wildcar is a native species essential to local biodiversity, and the other one is an aggressively invasive species that's decimating native biodiversity, and threatening the wildcat gene pool via interbreeding.   As i already stated, various carnivore lifestyles of native inuit and siberians were relatively sustainable before the exponential worsening of climate change (industrial & post-industrial era) and before human overpopulation. Currently they are not. but they are also at times necessary for isolated communities of siberians who live in inaccessible areas to survive. Again, irrelevant example. And totally disconnected from any bush habitats or the mongolian steppes.  edit; formatting

In NYC where I am in, we went from a peak death daily of 828 to 17 yesterday, a 98% reduction. Case tolls from 40,000 to 1500, a 97% reduction. Overall deaths as a % of the population constitute a de minimis rate. And it's even better when you consider that all restrictions are lifted. No one wears masks by and large outside hospitals or places you're mandated to by staff. We're going out, partying, going to bars and clubs and outdoor and indoor sporting events and had a NYE bash. People have gone to Thanksgiving and Christmas. So logically speaking, cases and death tolls should be meaningfully higher because everything's open to keep apples to apples, but we've seen a 98-99% reduction from peak tolls despite everything opening up. The statistics don't corroborate the anecdotal findings. Hospitalization and mortality rates have also gone in lockstep and the age strata have largely been where they were at the pandemic's onset.   &#x200B;  The vaccines themselves are supposed to abate hospitalizations, severe illness and death. You take the vaccine to avoid restricting yourself and having significant ailments from the virus. One of the other thing is that as information and data become available and the pandemic no longer nascent, you have to adapt based off of those latest findings. This is at the heart of statistical analysis. The last thing is that when we consider long COVID and other related issues, these folks also likely had various ailments. Blood pressure, diabetes, glaucoma, heart disease, sickle cell. Thyroid issues. Anemia. Previous procedures. They were already on the brink and teetering on life/death in some cases and COVID took them over the edge much like the warning for seniors to get flu shots because their immune systems can't fight off things like this.   &#x200B;  I got the initial round of vaccines (Moderna) in early 2021 but haven't gotten any boosters, have not worn a mask outside of places where they used to require them and I haven't gotten sick once in 3 years. The worst I felt health wise was probably after that 2nd dose and I felt like crap for 10 hours or so. Meanwhile, I have people in my family who are triple boosted, wear KN95 masks, don't go out, have their kids be the only ones in their class to wear a mask outdoors as well and they all got COVID even with all of this. A colleague of mine was double boosted at the time and wore a mask in the office and she ended up getting long COVID. This isn't going away, and your point about risk / reward is poignant. There's a way to eliminate any risk of COVID -- have everyone socially distance and never go out. That's impractical. The other is simply assess that we're at a place 99% lower than peak, with a highly efficacious vaccine that has served to abate symptoms. Kids at the beginning even were not target market for the coronavirus. Rates were low, deaths were de minimis. So elderly and immunocompromised may get some marginal benefit, but in economics this is the diminishing marginal rate of returns and it's just not worth walling yourself off forever for something everyone's inevitably going to get or has already gotten and they just didn't know about it.

But renewable electricity generation construction is now growing at an impressive speed. So much so that this year emissions from power generation are expected to be lower than last year. In a decade or two there will be enough wind and solar that it won't make sense to build more coal power plants, and at that stage there will be less and less coal being dug up. There will be no incentive to go and find new coal deposits. The same applies to oil and gas. If demand for them drops low enough, it won't be worth drilling new wells, and the output from the existing wells will get more expensive. Major car manufacturers are committing billions of dollars to developing and building EVs. ICE vehicles are on the way out. Now is the time for hope, not despair  For me, the despair is caused by people refusing to accept the truth. Yes, renewables are growing, but the truth is that it is far too little, far too late to make a significant difference to net climate change at the end of this process. The reason was made very clear at the end of COP26 when at the last moment the Indian delegation changed "phase out coal" to "phase down coal". India is now the most populous nation on Earth, and it has very large coal deposits of its own, as well as being an enthusiastic importer of Australian coal.  If you are asking me to base my hope on the belief that India is going to turn to renewables, and choose to leave its own coal in the ground when large numbers of Indian people still don't have access to electricity then you are asking me to believe in illusions.   I have been through despair. I was hospitalised for climate-related suicidal behaviour over 30 years ago, when almost nobody understood how bad the situation was. Since then I have not stopped watching, learning and trying to understand. I am now absolutely certain that the only real progress can come when we admit that we cannot save civilisation as we know it. Radical change is going to be forced on human civilisation, but it won't be mere *threats* of climate change that do this. It will be the consequences.

Roughly the 1949 armistice lines with somewhere between 90-95% of the west bank going to Palestine, without east Jerusalem. No 1:1 land swaps. No dismantling of settlements, but a gradual withdrawal and scaling down of military infrastructure with eventual full military withdrawal.  >How do you think the Israeli government would act giving that scenario?   The current one? Not well. Given a fully disarmed Palestine they might agree to recognition of the state, but wouldn't earnestly follow through with military withdrawal.

That is - development of civil infrastructure in Palestinian controlled territory. Had this been the main economic focus of Palestinians starting in the 60's, you'd see no settlers in the first place because they'd not be able to cross the international borders of the Palestinian state that would have existed. After 60 years of occupation, it's now going to take a lot longer than it would have if that strategy was pursued from day 1 (day 1 being 1967). But given a fantastical scenario where all Palestinians unilaterally decide to forego armed struggle, I suppose they also might have the patience to wait for a more moderate Israeli regime to replace the current one, which I would honestly expect to happen eventually given no violence coming from the west bank or Gaza.

We should be researching the bejeezus out of it so that we can eventually deploy the best version of it possible. And when we start deploying it at scale we should do it at every remaining point source before even thinking about DAC, because the CO2 concentrations are 20X higher so the equipment can be 20X smaller.  Doing nature based solutions that don't misappropriate carbon-free energy production is fine, but also a drop in the bucket, and we have to be careful that the land use aspect of it is equitable.

In conclusion any loss of  innocent life is tragic (yes people like nitinyahu can rot in a hole of fire for all i care),on one hand the only way isreal can salvage this situation is either back off and recognize the two state solution or kill most of the arab world,on the other hand Isreal tactics don't work against arabs in general it never worked when the turks were in charge why would it work now.  Note: only a two state solution might work because Isreal won't win elections in a 1 state solution and their constitution is obviously neither democratic or secular.  2nd note: and no giving Palestine a state without the ability to have defense is ridiculous and one of the main reasons a peace treaty was never reached between isreal and Palestine,expecting peace in a two state solution from people who are still illegally settling in the west bank without the ability or right to kill them yes i said kill than it would be basically the same situation as today.why would i expect peace from Palestinians? When the popular theme in the west was protests Palestinians obliged they got shot instead for it but that's what happens when the west lives by rules for thee but not for me.

Arizona requires candidates to collect signatures from voters to qualify for the ballot, and as an independent Sinema will need to have valid signatures equivalent to 3% of all registered independents in the state to get on the ballot, which works out to 43,783. These are due April 8th, 2024.  Best practices among signature collection for candidates in the state advises candidates to get ~50% extra signatures for buffer since not all will be valid, which works out to 65,674 signatures - although I think given that this is a statewide and not a districted race she may be fine with something in the 55-60K range.  But still, that's a colossal amount of signatures. Sinema only submitted 10,950 back when initially running in 2018, and by my count only two candidates have ever submitted >20K in the state's history (Kelly in 2022, and Richard Mahoney in 2002 when he ran as a centrist independent in that year's gubernatorial). This'd be a tough ask for anyone, and will be harder still with few people supporting her strongly enough to volunteer for signature collection.

I find SCOTUS hard to get a solid read of honestly. The court is more partisan than it has been in a very long time and its rulings are deeply reflective of that. But whatever rulings they make cut deeper than what other Republican plays do.  It is quite possible they decided to delay the immunity case because they see Trump dying on another hill instead. One that allows them to leave the immunity question undecided for other perceived benefits. For instance, if they affirm the CO decision or if Trump is mortally wounded in the GA case.  Looking at it from a partisan lens the Republican Party needs an off ramp from Trump. He has his voter base clamped hard around him, but no one in their party has been able to similarly grab those voters and their party's core focus is now just Trump. They aren't united around a platform of any kind. SCOTUS may be their best chance at an off ramp since none of SCOTUS is subject to ballot box pressure.  In similar vein, SCOTUS has been so nakedly partisan that the respect for the institution is near zero. They could use rulings against Trump, in cases like CO, as ways of saying "see, we're not partisan" to try and regain some credibility by having both sides of the political spectrum unhappy with their recent rulings. Possibly reducing pressure to "pack the court". Giving them a bit of a win win scenario here.  The 14th is a plain read and the Senate debates reinforce its plain read focus. But I won't bet on which way a ruling will go. Lots of reasons for this court to go either way.  Hopefully they have the clarity of mind to enforce the Constitution as that's what the nation needs.

That's not true before the disengagement in 2004 Hamas fired800 mortar shells and close to 300 Quasam rockets into Israel. Israel initiated the blockade when Hamas violently seized powering murdering their Fatah political rivals and their families bc Hamas's stated goal was to attack Israel. The blockade WAS intended for security  2. the West Bank governance is not mild or peaceful in any way. Israel prevents a multitude of terror attacks on a regular basis do to their heavy involvement in the region. Here's a list of terror attacks you can see how many have come from Fatah :  https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/major-palestinian-terror-attacks-since-oslo There has never been a good faith peaceful Palestinian activist movement or government that is willing to accept an Israeli state. Even Arafat talked out of two sides of his mouth- peace to Israel, and destruction of Israel to Palestinians.  Camp David was a real attempt on the part of Israel, Arafat's refusal really solidified for the Israeli consciousness that Palestinians will never make peace with us and from then on voters started electing Likud (right)  3. No point in rehashing 2008 peace talks it's after the second intifada, sorry the Israeli public wasn't in a more giving mood. My point was if there had NOT been a wave of terror Israel would not be radicalized like it is - part of that is accepting settlers and similar radical ideologies. You can't point fingers at that without the context of what created it (and vice versa for the Palestinians)  4. Are you actually saying that Hamas is NOT an Iranian proxy? you can't be a serious person and believe that. Yes it seems Iran has abandoned and decided to sacrifice their proxy probably bc the US response after Oct 7 spooked them or maybe it was the plan all along. Their goal is to weaken the Israeli relationship with America, bc without their support Israel absolutely faces an existential threat. They also probably wanted to sabotage the Abraham Accords but that was a failure. And don't underestimate Hezbollah either, they are a powerful military and not ragtag at all. They are actually well armed and far more sophisticated than Hamas. If the war in the North starts it will be horrific for both sides

What Im trying to point out and this is a common liberal error that we Christians should make efforts to avoid that just because a person in position of authority makes a particular law against natural law, lets say to enforce the murder of innocent children by their own mothers before they even come forth from womb, this doesnt mean that that person loses any authority at all. You would still be required to obey this person in the position of authority on all other commands or laws that dont contradict Divine or natural laws, such as traffic laws, paying your taxes, etc.  In other words, just because the United States, say, enforces a right to a mass slaughter of children that would make Hitler blush, that doesnt mean the United States is therefore no longer in a position of legitimate authority. *Thats* what Im trying to hammer down. The, say, Wycliffe error that mortal sin causes a person to forfeit their actual position of authority over others has already been condemned by the Church. I know you arent Catholic, but you wont find any Orthodox Christians disagreeing that Wycliffe was in error on this point.  And if you look at the behavior of the martyrs, what I described is exactly how they treated the authorities that eventually murdered them. Consider St. Polycarps words to the very authority that would pass his death sentence:  >>Then said the Proconsul, Persuade the people. Polycarp replied, Thee I had deemed worthy of discourse, for we are taught to render to authorities and the powers ordained of God honour as is fitting. But I deem not this mob worthy that I should defend myself before them.  You can see that St. Polycarp is rooting his understanding directly in the words of Christ and those of the Apostle Paul. Thats part of what makes the martyrs so striking: they were actually excellent citizens and obedient subjects. Thomas More bluntly said that King Henry was his legitimate king and that he would obey that king in all matters except those that contradict the faith as revealed by Christ through the Church. *This* is the orthodox attitude towards worldly authorities, not the Protestant/Enlightenment idea that one in a position of authority loses his position if he acts imprudently and unjustly, which is really just the Protestants rationalizing disobeying their legitimate bishops when they condemned their errors, liberals rationalizing disobeying their rulers when their rulers tried to put down their rebellions, and feminists rationalizing disobeying their fathers when their fathers try to correct their childrens vicious behavior.  >Authority has nothing everything to do with whether or not power is exercised justly, and not merely to do with dependence. > >The fundamental root questions are: What is power? What is the end of power? > >Power, as I said above, is the making of others to do what one wants, but the end of power is the common good, which is itself subordinate to the spiritual vocation of man.  First of all, I want to direct you to the ideas of the Orthodox Deacon and American journalist Brian Patrick Mitchell, particularly [his distinction between *arche* and *kratos*.](http://www.brianpatrickmitchell.com/2015/04/30/christian-anarchists-how-politics-corrupts-our-language-of-relation/) Ive found his concepts quite useful in understanding how to divide up the modern political map. You might as well.  With that said, I think, but Im not completely convinced, that dependence is a more general outline of authority than the use of force, which seems to be what you mean. For example, I would understand the use of force to make someone do what the user wants as an instance of the more general principle that the one who is subject to that force is dependent on that strength for his security. After all, the reason we have a group of men with a kind of monopoly over the use of force is not merely so they could tell us what to do, but so that they can serve to secure the community and regulate the use of force in order to resolve conflicts between citizens in favor of the parties in the right rather than the parties in the wrong. In this way, the use of force is a kind of dependency on the strong for protections and security of ones right against those who would trespass against that right.  The reason I mentioned Mitchell here is because his idea of *arche* is easy to relate to Blackstones understanding of dependency as the root of authority. Even *kratos* is ultimately rooted in *arche*, or at least should be, which is something I think you would agree with.

Jews and Arabs live in peace, just like things were before the evil rise of Zionism. All that needs to happen is a removal of both of these oppressive governments.

Unemployment and labor force participation are at very high points, and inflation has significantly come down after a high period post Covid. Its possible Trump could manage to not screw anything up in a major way, and still remain very popular since things are so great already. Likely with some moderate Republican priorities delivered on the way.   * Your scenario is much like the Bush presidency disasters leading into the Obama years. Things did not work out how you expect them to. Instead, Obama spent much of his time undoing damage from the Bush years, and being unpopular because of general economic troubles. Obama had some limited successes, but far right state and local governments took power because of the state of the economy and blocked many of his plans. Remember- Obama passed free Medicaid for all (poor citizens), a huge accomplishment- but the Supreme Court allowed states to opt out, and many did.   * The Supreme Court is uniquely powerful in America. Currently- its 6-3 R to D. Theres two old Republican justices- they likely will step down during the next Republican administration, so a Trump presidency would give Republican justices power to veto any progressive laws for the next 25 years, and likely much longer.   * Progressive policy often means more power for the government, conservative policy often means less power. A progressive policy to raise taxes and spend more means people need to trust the government with higher taxes and trust it to decide how to spend the money. This is tricker than just reducing the size of government, and poor performance by Trump likely will have many Americans wanting LESS government power, which dooms progressives  * US elections have undemocratic measures to them. Gerrymandering, and the senate having 2 votes per state regardless of population. Take a look at the 2028 senate [MAP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028_United_States_Senate_elections). Assuming Trump is elected and fails, Democratic candidates may do well, but still lose in states like North Carolina, Missouri, Wisconsin, Ohio,  Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Florida, Iowa. Theyd need at least four of these states to pick up a single senate seat (or a win in far unlikelier states, like Idaho, South Dakota). The 2024 senate map is brutal for Dems, so a huge performance in 202) and 2028 might still yield a Republican senate in 2028- with only 1/3 of each seats elected each year.   * US Democratic systems may be dramatically different in 2028. There have been Republican efforts to crush unions, particularly public sector unions.  Unions could be forever weaker if Trump wins in 2024. Some states have interesting electoral college systems, you should read about how Mississippi elected their governors until 2020. Its possible that in the 2028 presidential election- a Republican could win certain states by only winning more **counties**, not voters (counties skew rural and Republican).    * Trump was President once already. It was largely disastrous, we had a global pandemic and unemployment rates near 30% briefly. The result was that Biden won, and there was a Democratic wave in 2018, and Biden has had many progressive policies implemented- most notably a huge climate package and large temporary COVID relief. But after all that, Republicans control the house and there is a tie in the senate, and the Trump tax policies remain in effect, and a Republican presidency is very possible again. Id imagine your best case scenario would end up similar in 2032 under a Trump win.

Now that Ron DeSantis has ducked out of what passes for the race for the Republican nomination, Ms Haley is, if the polls are to be believed, the only thing that stands between Donald Trump and the White House. And that means that all of that famous Trumpian scorn will be directed at her and her alone.  Having worked for him as US ambassador to the UN, and observed him at close quarters, she knows exactly what she is getting into. Thus far, to her credit, she refuses to be intimidated by Mr Trumps usual repertoire of childish name-calling and alternative facts, willingly amplified most viciously on social media and captive news channels by his adoring base. For that alone Ms Haley deserves thanks and praise, if not a Purple Heart.  Maybe that steely personality is why Mr Trump got her mixed up with Nancy Pelosi, the formidable former speaker of the House of Representatives, who also stood up to Mr Trump and got up his nose. Or perhaps not.  Mr DeSantis, a man so mean-spirited he makes Mr Trump look positively graceful, managed to misquote Winston Churchill in his sour concession speech, which is rather fitting. He was so prone to demeaning Ms Halley in the most chauvinistic manner that shed be forgiven for taking some special pleasure in the rapid unscheduled disassembly of his political career.  This deflated egotist has now thrown in his lot with Mr Trump, who has reciprocated by promoting the former Ron DeSanctimonious to a really terrific person. So miserable was the Florida governors bid for the nomination that he cant necessarily expect much from Mr Trump for his endorsement, but it seems that Mr DeSantis doesnt have much choice.  The question now is what does the remarkably vibrant Ms Haley do in the circumstances she finds herself  even further behind Mr Trump than was Mr DeSantis in the Iowa caucus result and confronted with the most solid political base in modern American history.  The only answer can be: more of the same. So far as her pitch to the party faithful is concerned, she would be in any other circumstances a classic populist conservative Republican in the contemporary.  The oversized tangerine personality of Mr Trump tends to overshadow just how much she agrees with him and the Maga movement and, in her case, probably more sincerely, seeing as she didnt, once upon a time, hang out with the Clintons and vote Democrat.  She has, for example, recently said that she would be OK with a federal anti-abortion law, and once advocated sending US special forces into Mexico  an invasion and an act of war. A Haley presidency wouldnt be quite so clownish as Mr Trumps last term of office, and shed be less mesmerised by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, but it wouldnt be so very different from that of Mr Trump.  From her point of view, cynically or not, she needs to echo her rivals prejudices and do a better job than Mr DeSantis did of portraying herself as a younger, less nutty version of the 45th president.  She is also shrewd enough to stress her relative youth  52  and appeal to the wider Republican electorate to opt for her to prevent a Biden-Trump (current combined age 158 years) rerun, two candidates who cannot be said to be in the prime of life.  In doing so, Ms Haley taps into a deep disquiet among Americans about how their party system has delivered such an unprecedented and unpalatable choice to them. As President Kennedy didnt quite say: Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to an old generation of Americans  Can she do it? There is, as the professional political strategists say, a path to success, albeit exceedingly narrow. New Hampshire, the scene of the next primary, is much more promising territory for her as it will include independents as well as Republicans, and the variegated opponents of Mr Trump can now coalesce behind her as the sole challenger to the status quo.  She might even develop enough momentum to then score another decent result in her home state of South Carolina, though Mr Trump seems well established there. Plus, there is the ever-present possibility of the law catching up with Mr Trump such that his candidature ceases to be viable. Its possible.  America and the world will know soon enough whether Ms Haley is made of such stuff as to beat the Trump machine. When the picture becomes clear, then it will be up to the Democrats to decide how to respond.  The conventional wisdom is that Mr Trump is the candidate that President Biden would find easiest to beat  but that does not mean that Mr Biden would beat him. If Ms Haley does emerge as the Republican nominee, to a mixture of relief and surprise, to challenge Biden, then the Democrat establishment will have some uncomfortable options to contemplate.   Straying a little into fantasy, America in 2024 might even be given a choice between two women of colour for the presidency  Ms Haley and Vice-President Kamala Harris. Far-fetched as that may be, what does seem clear is that America deserves a better choice than Biden-Trump, the Statler and Waldorf of presidential politics.

Saying Ukraine would target every school and hospital for the sake of it is not whats going on in Gaza. Hamas are embedding themselves amongst the civilian population as a war tactic. This tactic is centuries old and has been used repeatedly in war. Hamas have also been using this tactic since its birth. Its well documented - both from the IDF, journalists, Nato, The UN etc. The public can deny this repeatedly but there is ample evidence from years of them doing this. [this](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf) document is very interesting if anyone wants to read about historic strategies of the Hamas / Israeli War. Due to the strategies developed by Hamas there are now strict guidelines in which Israel can operate legally. If they are operating within these means then it is actually considered legal. Every single strike has to be approved and the IDF developed a whole department on lawfare. Unfortunately it seems ethics arent that important in war, which I agree is terrible. But Hamas are not operating ethically by any means. As much as the world sees Israel indiscriminately bombing civilians, its doesnt see the deliberate tactics Hamas are using to make them look bad. Israel by now know what is lawfare. They are likely to be gathering evidence before and after each strike. If any of them are found to be unlawful, then they will be prosecuted. Unfortunately Hamas are using unlawful tactics and are immune from prosecution because they dont abide by legal rules anyway. But what the public deems illegal vs what is actually legal is two very different things.

The very last action of Britain before it withdrew from Palestine was British defending a Palestinian towns from a jewish paramilitary attack:  *With World War II nearing an end, the Irgun renewed its campaign against the British. From 1944 and onwards, the British faced a growing Jewish insurgency* *in Palestine.* *In February 1947, the British government  having already decided to withdraw from India  announced it was handing the mandate back to the League of Nations. The British mandate was relinquished and the establishment of the State of Israel* *was affirmed by a United Nations General Assembly resolution. The conflict with the insurgents continued until the last British soldier left Palestine; at the end of April 1948, British forces fought a small battle* *against Zionist militias near Jaffa, temporarily preventing a Jewish takeover of the city, while failing to expel the militias from Menashiya.*  After the creation of Israel Britain was at the brink of WAR with Israel.  From wiki:  *Relations between Israel and Britain were hostile during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War*, *at one point bringing the two countries to the edge of direct military confrontation. Britain, which had military forces in Egypt and Transjordan and defense agreements with both nations, foresaw possible military intervention on their behalf. Early in the war, a Royal Air Force base in Amman was hit during an Israeli raid on the city. The British threatened to attack the Israeli Air Force if such an action was repeated. During the battles in Sinai, the Royal Air Force* *conducted almost daily reconnaissance missions over Israel and the Sinai. RAF reconnaissance aircraft took off from Egyptian airbases and sometimes flew alongside Royal Egyptian Air Force* *planes, and high-flying British aircraft frequently flew over Haifa* *and Ramat David Airbas*e. *The British government planned military action against Israel codenamed Operation Clatter in the event of an Israeli invasion of Egypt and the flights were deployed to discover the strength of the Israeli Air Force and locate its forward bases.*  *On 20 November 1948, an unarmed RAF photo-reconnaissance de Havilland Mosquito* *was shot down by an Israeli Air Force P-51 Mustang. On 7 January 1949, four British Spitfire* *FR18s flew over an Israeli convoy that had been attacked by five Egyptian Spitfires fifteen minutes earlier. Fearing an imminent attack, Israeli ground troops opened fire on the British Spitfires, and shot down one with a tank-mounted machine gun. The remaining three Spitfires were subsequently shot down by Israeli planes, and two pilots were killed. Two of the surviving pilots were taken to Tel Aviv* *and interrogated, and were later released. The Israelis dragged the wrecks of the British planes into Israeli territory, but failed to conceal them before they were photographed by British reconnaissance planes. In response, the Royal Air Force readied its planes to bomb Israeli airfields, British troops in the Middle East were placed on high alert with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. Following a British ultimatum to vacate the Sinai, Israeli forces pulled back. War between Israel and the United Kingdom was thus avoided.*  Before the creation of Israel in the 10s, 20s, 30s Britain tried to keep balance and fought against both zionist paramilitary groups and palestinian paramilitary groups.  The British parliament and people had no sympathies with creating a jewish state. The Balfour decalaration says words, but the words are 'sympathise with zionist aspirations', 'a home for jewish people', it doesn't talk about creating a new state, they're just the words of a foreign secretary who is trying to dress up nicely the real policy which he has to tell Rothschild, which the real policy is stated that jews can go and live there if they want, but: ***"It being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country".***  The situation became ugly and Britain restricted jewish immigration with the White Paper 1939, which led to larger conflict between Britain and zionist paramilitaries. First WW2 happens, and a big mistake is that when recruiting units in the area they recruited and trained jewish units for WW2. As soon as WW2 ends they are fighting the jewish units they trained (Very American moment training terrorists and then having to fight those terrorists you trained).  The British found themselves in a contradiction.  1. The real British-made policy was that if the Arabs had an uprising against the Ottoman Turks then the British would give the Arabs their freedom. (Look up McMahon-Hussein Correspondence). 2. Sykes-Picot Agreement where Britain agreed with France to split up the region and keep Palestine under international control 3. Not being able to stop the zionist pressure for jewish mass migration to the area and having written nice words in 'Balfour Declaration' (just a piece of correspondence by an idiot, just a letter to Rothschild that basically says "Sorry, no, the British parliament says it will stop jewish migration if it hurts the rights of the local people" and making that sound nice), but nonetheless the zionist interests could point to it.  The League of Nations gave control of Palestine to Britain and told Britain to implement the contradictory things of both prepare Palestine for self-governance and independence and also welcome the jewish migration.  There's a lot of legitimate criticism of Britain for that mess, but Britain stuck at trying to keep balance for 30 years. After WW2 Britain gave up and withdrew and America ruled the world. The end of Britain and America taking over is when you get the creation of Israeli state, the Nakba and majority of Palestinians being displaced and slaughters of Palestinians.  It's no coincidence it was just a mess when Britain had power, but it's rapid colonisation of Palestine once America rules.

You're not wrong. But if I may offer you one additional detail that makes your case even stronger: **In any diaspora population anywhere, those members who can phenotypically blend in with the local host population have a major survival and reproductive advantage over those who can't.** A diaspora member who can effectively "pass" for a local can hide (or at least avoid drawing attention to) his ethnic minority status. This makes it easier and quicker to win locals' trust, which can have very real downstream quality-of-life effects. Such a person is a lot less likely to be othered by the locals at first sight, or targeted for mistreatment for being so conspicuously different, which makes life marginally less stressful and dangerous. This becomes especially apparent when the diaspora minority community and their local host population have a great deal of tension between them, including but not limited to the host population being fairly homogeneous and intolerant of people who are different. Looking like a local will give a minority member greater sexual / marriage market value, not only within her own community, but potentially to locals, because her appearance is closer to their standard of beauty. And again, if there's a fair deal of inter-communal tension, any local dating or marrying her will likely face much less disapproval from strangers, because it's not as obvious he's in an interracial relationship. A less stressful life makes for fewer premature births and stillbirths, and a more wholesome childhood.  I could go on. The point is, if you're going to be an ethnic minority living somewhere, particularly one not native to that place, never discount the advantage of being able to blend in with the locals. And over many generations in the same place, the differential survival and reproductive rates of people who can versus can't blend in, will ensure that most members of the minority community eventually *will* have a look that blends in.

Previous work has sought to constrain the magnitude and pattern of glacial cooling from paleothermometers, but the uneven distribution of the proxies, as well as their uncertainties, has challenged the construction of a full-field view of the LGM climate state. Here, we combine a large collection of geochemical proxies for sea-surface temperature with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to produce a field reconstruction of LGM temperatures using data assimilation. The reconstruction is validated with withheld proxies as well as independent ice core and speleothem d18O measurements. Our assimilated product provides a precise constraint on global mean LGM cooling of -5.9C (-6.3  -5.6C, 95% CI). Given assumptions concerning the radiative forcing of GHGs, ice sheets, and aerosols, this cooling **translates to an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3.2C (2.2  4.3C, 95% CI), a value that is higher than previous estimates and but consistent with the traditional consensus range of 2  4.5C.**

If everyone does their part here, then it will be easier and you'll likely be more willing to vote for the next person that continues it.  The math is obvious to virtually everyone at this point that a 'no-vote' or a protest vote or a 3rd party vote helps your opposing presidential candidate.  Setting aside that 2016 seemed to be more a matter of apathy than actual opposition to Clinton, imagine this was the first time Trump was running for office - by not voting in a Democrat, you'd witness a Republican President and administration either actively or tangentially 1) overturn Roe v. Wade, 2) exit the Paris climate accords, 3) abandon the Kurds, 4) attempt to bribe a foreign head of state, 5) incite an insurrection, 6) reveal classified military secrets, and 7) barely miss the window to help Russia conquer its neighbor.  Those are effects that resonate directly from the Presidential election - none of that actually requires Congressional alignment and are things that can happen whether you have a friendly Congress or not (maybe one or two if veto-proof).  By not voting or voting for a non-viable 3rd party, you are asking for those and more.  Virtually *any* Democrat getting elected instead of Trump in 2016 ensures most if not all of that doesn't happen.    I can appreciate that you have a hard line you don't want to cross, but I implore you to look at the math and realize that regardless of your stance on that matter and your actions taken (or not taken) to abide by it, there's not really any uncertainty here - Trump will be objectively worse for Palestine in nearly every way.  This is a rare opportunity in modern American politics to compare two *actual* presidencies; we *know* how Trump will behave, we *know* how people will manipulate him when he has power because it's *already happened*.  That someone saw that and is fine with it when there IS a better option is distressing.

They conquered the Israelites territories in the 7th century probably but at that point they were not native to the land, like instead Israelites and Jewish people were for 1500 plus years before that time.   - Jews were chased, casted away by them, especially because Islam had rose as the main religion among Arabs, and Quran hates Jews.   - The palestinians today have direct genetic descendance. I really want to know by how much and in what percentage among the population. Probably high.   They all are semites, they share the same ancestor language that got differentiated in Hebrew and Arab languages. OF COURSE THEY DESCENDED by the same people. This doesnt mean that arabs that now live in Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Jordans are natives to Israel and so the Palestinian Arabs now are more native than Israeli.   Jews historically have 1500 years of advantage to claim their right to the land of Israel to any muslim arab. Many, probably most of the palestinians of today just descend from other arabs who inhabited for millenia Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq.    Can we stop pushing the idea of the colonisation? Palestinian arabs arent like Native Americans and Jews (who returned to their brothers living in Israel already) arent white colonisers.  The palestinian people before the British Mandate, or during the Ottoman Empire were just Jews or Muslim Arabs. Many palestinian people before 1967 still called themselves Egyptians or Jordanians. They used the term palestinian to assume a collective identity that arose and was made up by the competition, rivalry and hatred against Israel.  Palestinians arent Kurds.

Even ancient rabbis and modern aswell see the just war is allowed. Peace should always be strived for but there's a limit to how much one can take  Judaism and war  Judaism does not regard violence and war to promote justice as always wrong. It accepts that certain kinds of war will be ethically justified, and that it is sometimes morally acceptable to kill people. Before declaring war or starting a battle there must be a genuine attempt to make peace and avoid the conflict. Jewish law only permits combatants to be deliberately killed in war. Innocent civilians must be given every opportunity to leave the field of combat before a battle starts.  Old Testament  In much of the Old Testament God gives his clear approval to war. He is identified as a warrior, and is shown as leading the Jews in conflict, bringing them victory, protecting them from enemy forces. But at the same time the Old Testament is filled with Jewish longing for peace.  They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. Isaiah 2  Peace  Peace is seen as something that comes from God and that will only be fully realised when there is justice and harmony not just between peoples, but within individual communities. Some of the present day arguments put forwards in the context of terrorism take up this idea that there can be no real peace without justice for all.The importance of peace to the Jewish people is emphasised by 'Shalom', the conventional greeting between Jews from the earliest times, which means 'peace'.  Self-defence  The Talmud states that a person (a Jew or a non-Jew) is permitted to kill "a pursuer" to save his own life. This ruling applies to both individuals and groups of people (including states).  The Rabbis  The ancient rabbis thought that there were three types of war that a Jewish state should consider:  Obligatory wars:these are wars that God commanded Jews to fight. They include the biblical wars against the Canaanites and against the Amalekites.  Defensive wars:(These are also obligatory.) If the Jewish people are attacked, they are obliged to defend themselves. This doctrine covers pre-emptive strikes (which is when a country attacks an enemy who is about to attack it).  Some writers think that a war of self-defence doesn't count as a war, but is merely the normal action that can be taken under the Jewish law dealing with attackers and based on Genesis 9:6 "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed."  Optional wars:These are wars undertaken for a good reason, and where no other form of "negotiation" remains possible.  The rules of war  The Jewish tradition is clear that before declaring war, or starting a battle, there must be an attempt to make peace - any military action without doing this is probably unlawful (Deuteronomy 20:10). Only combatants are allowed to be killed intentionally in war. Military commanders should give non-combatants a good chance to leave the combat area before the battle starts. (This is usually impractical in modern warfare.) However some authorities say that if a non-combatant knowingly stays in a place where a battle is about to take place, they lose their protection.  https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/war.shtml  This almost mirrors what I previously posted about.

Considering these are pretty much ubiquitously considered renewable, it doesnt take a ton of imagination to see how this can go from responsible forestry to only having to shout those trees are coming right for us! in order to roll through and start chopping them all down.   A couple REC providers have also been caught not fulfilling the replanting obligation they had committed to. In one case the property coordinates that were listed for a completed project led to an empty city block

That isn't in dispute: what is in dispute was whether he tried to do so because he had legitimate concern that the dems tried to rig the election (what his allies are baslessly claiming) or whether he tried to hold on to power in the full knowledge that he had lost and that there were no credible claims of voter fraud.  That Trump tried to prevent the peaceful transference of power is not in doubt.

If someone told you the world would end but told you exactly the details of how it happens, it already would have a different feeling. You'd have finality and you'd have specifics, not some vague boogeyman.  Reality is that the world is not ending, it's just a lot of pain is coming up. If we know what is coming up we can also counteract it and minimise it.  So, one small man's opinion on a range of topics that will come up, read below.  ====================================  Honestly, the largest problems you will see, in my opinion, are these:  \- Strong Heat  \- Floods  \- Fire  \- Possible food scarcity  \- Water scarcity  \- Rising cost of living     That said, all of these things have ways to be tackled and are not impossible to overcome.  Definitely make sure you can have some trees in the area where you live,or try to move where there are some. The shade is super important to help with the hot summers.  For floods, I'm not sure. At the end of the day brick construction can hold, it does get very dirty. We'll probably learn to build in a different way, and maybe start digging more floodplains. The thing is once we know "this is how things work now", we can adapt with a bit of engineering. It is not too difficult. Much easier than the previous work of convincing people there is a climate emergency (it proved impossible, in the end people are only seeing it now as the world is actively on fire, so from now on IMHO it's all much easier).  For fires, there are ways to manage land so that fires can stop at a certain point and not go beyond. This one worries me too. For now we seem to be managing. Most of them are done with criminal intent, maybe surveillance drones can help against it.  For food scarcity, there is veganism. Much much so much infinitely cheaper, much easier to maintain for a large population, you always have access to things fairly easily. It doesn't require a monstruous amount of resources like animal products do. That will really help, I trust with time we'll eventually figure it out and food scarcity will be a thing of the past. For reference, plants require a tenth of the resources (water, fuel, land) for the same output (mix of carb, protein, fat required to live).  For water scarcity the same applies. 2/3rds of the world's crops are just for animal feed (which then gives us 10% of our intake more or less), so switching away from those would make agricultural irrigation an order of magnitude easier to maintain.  For the cost of living we need political progress I think. It is clear now, with economic crisis after economic crisis, that everyone is getting poorer while a few people are multiplying their riches over and over. Even a small redistribution of income could change things massively. I hope we eventually figure it out, for now a lot seem to believe the propaganda that "oh you can't strangle business, the economy will be fucked then we'll all be poor". It should be clear now that decades of not funding healthcare, education, transport, housing and other services is not helping anyone whatsoever. Again, it will take some time, who knows.

But almost half of that occurred in 2019 and 2020, and the region may be near a threshold beyond which extreme fires become more common.  Rapid warming of the Arctic has led to the extreme wildfire seasons experienced in Siberia in recent years, scientists said Thursday, and such severe fires are likely to continue.  The researchers said that the Siberian Arctic, with its vast expanses of forest, tundra, peatlands and permafrost, was approaching a threshold beyond which even small temperature increases could result in sharp increases in the extent of fires.  Global warming is changing the fire regime above the Arctic Circle in Siberia, said David L.A. Gaveau, one of the researchers. His company, TheTreeMap, monitors deforestation around the world.  In the Arctic, wildfires can result in the burning of decayed organic matter in peat and thawed permafrost. That releases carbon dioxide, adding to warming and making the goal of reining in climate change more difficult.  Over the past four decades, the Arctic as a whole has been warming about four times faster than the global average. Recent summers in eastern Siberia have been marked by particularly extreme temperatures  as much as 38 degrees Celsius, or 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The warmth has been accompanied by severe and extensive wildfires. Observations indicated that the fire seasons were exceptional, Dr. Gaveau said. But there were no precise quantitative assessments to justify these claims.  He and his colleagues analyzed satellite data to map the burned area each summer from 1982 to 2020. Over that time, a total of nearly 23 million acres burned. The researchers found that together, 2019 and 2020 accounted for nearly half of the total. The burning was much, much higher than in the last 40 years, Dr. Gaveau said. [The study was published in the journal Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9768).  They then looked at factors that affect wildfire risk, including the length of the growing season (which results in more vegetation available to burn) and air and surface temperatures (warm conditions dry out the vegetation, making it easier to burn) and found that these have increased over the decades.  Those and other factors are causing what were seeing  an increase in areas of burning, he said.  In 2019 and 2020, average summer temperatures in the Siberian Arctic have been above 10 degrees Celsius, or 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Dr. Gaveau said that 10 degrees could be a tipping point, or threshold, beyond which wildfire activity greatly increases with just a small increase in temperature.  Its worrying because predictions essentially indicate that the fires of 2019, 2020 will become the norm by the end of the century, he said.  They estimated that the fires of 2019 and 2020, which burned large areas of peatland, resulted in the release of more than 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is greater than the total annual emissions of Australia. With more extreme fire years, Dr. Gaveau said, theres going to be much more carbon released into the atmosphere every year because of global warming in a region that would not normally burn as much.  Brendan M. Rogers, who studies the effect of climate change on Arctic ecosystems at Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts and was not involved in the study, said the findings are adding to the story that we keep seeing year by year and expect to keep happening as long as the planet is warming.  Were just getting more fires in these systems and theyre emitting carbon.  The fires are also affecting the permafrost, permanently frozen ground that underlies much of the Siberian Arctic. The organic matter in the thawed ground begins to decompose, releasing carbon dioxide and methane, but it can also dry out and eventually burn, resulting in even more emissions.  The study adds to the urgency of reducing emissions, Dr. Rogers said, with global climate talks to take place next week in Egypt. It also reinforces what he and other climate scientists have been saying: Emissions from thawed permafrost and Arctic wildfires currently are not fully accounted for in global carbon budgets, and need to be, because these emissions will affect how much countries need to reduce emissions from fossil-fuel burning to limit global warming.  [A separate study published in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn4419) looked at factors that drove the extreme fire season of 2021, in addition to 2019 and 2020.  Rebecca C. Scholten of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and colleagues found that earlier snowmelt was an important contributor. Over the past half-century, spring snowmelt in northeastern Siberia has started an average of 1.7 days earlier per decade. An earlier snowmelt leads to a longer period when soil and vegetation dry out, increasing the risk of burning.  The researchers also found that changes in the polar jet stream that circles the planet most likely contributed to greater fire activity. During many weeks when extreme fires occurred, the jet stream was temporarily split in two, with a northerly branch and a more southerly one. Referred to as an Arctic front jet, it is marked by a region of lower-level air that is stationary and allows heat to build up, increasing fire risk.  This divergent jet stream is the same phenomenon that scientists say likely contributes to increasing heat waves in Europe.  Dr. Scholten said the research showed that the two factors worked together.  Its a compound effect, she said. Its only if we have early snowmelt, which we have more with climate warming, and then if we have an Arctic front jet, which we also have more frequently with climate warming, then we have like really extreme fire risk.

I was talking about *just* the former. While plenty of party members were in the army, there were plenty of those at the supporter level or non-members. Disbanding the army is a whole separate issue to discuss. Of course, determining the impact of one on its own (and what synergistic effects they may have had with each other) is no easy feat as they were concurrent actions.  I'll have to track down which source as best I can, but the curse of a lot of reading over many years is it does start to blur together where you read which thing. I believe it was No End in Sight: Iraq's Descent into Chaos that gave the 50k civil government employees being purged as a result of de-Baathification. I know I've seen higher estimates, closer to 100k but even that would be less than 7% of the party membership. The perception a lot have is that anyone affiliated with the party was purged but that's hardly the case from what I've read (and heard from people who were there firsthand).   It's not to say that how we handled it was ideal, but that the impact of that policy in particular is somewhat overstated. Disbanding the security apparatus loyal to Saddam almost certainly had a larger impact. Things were fairly compartmentalized due to how dictators run things and you had military capable men with weapons involved. Particularly with the armories being opened to basically enable them to stash away weapons (as did many criminal elements) it was a messy situation.  Thing is though, I'm not sure how viable the alternatives would be. Letting Saddam loyalists and a military built around protecting his regime continue to exist as they were sounds like a recipe for disaster in its own right. You can get rid of all the Baathists in the officer corps but now you have an army that is far too big for the remaining officers to handle which is ripe for corruption and crime. You needed to dismantle the authoritarian structures and people who wanted to reestablish them while not creating masses of angry, unemployed men with military expertise. In cases like Nazi Germany it was easy because, well, most of the capable men were dead or wounded and the remainder were mostly in captivity. They also wanted to cooperate with the west as causing a headache for the US/UK might mean they pull out and leave you to the Soviets which no one in Germany was exactly clamoring for...

Ulysses S Grant ordered expulsion of Jews from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Kentucky in 1862 and was only stopped when President Abraham Lincoln stepped in weeks later. And of course the 20th century saw exterminations and expulsions en masse from Russia to Germany to parts of the Ottoman Empire to Algeria etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.  The vast majority of Jews who immigrated to Israel have done so as refugees who in many cases had been stripped of their citizenship or never granted it in the first place despite having lived peacefully and legally in one place for generations, centuries, or even millennia (like Iraq). In an ideal world, yeah, everyone gets along. But in reality it just hasn't worked out like that. Israel asks "who is a Jew" not out of supremacy but out of preservation.

Fundamental Christians see Jews as God's chosen people, so they feel a sort of kinship with them as compared to Muslims. There's a cultural memory of the Crusades combined with how the modern world is still divided geographically between Christians and Muslims. The enemy of my enemy, etc.  There are also a lot of them that are accelerationists; they believe that the second coming of Jesus will be sooner if there's more global unrest since that's one of the defining features of the "end times".  Also, Zionists (by which I mean Israeli national supremacists) have worked hard to conflate Israel and the Jewish identity so that they're synonymous in the public opinion through lobbying and through groups that aggressively propagate the idea like AIPAC.  There's a large contingent of elites in the US that either genuinely belong to the fundamentalist Christian belief system or depend on the support of those that do. Still others have business and financial interests that depend on the welfare of Israel, especially if they work or own companies in the military industrial complex ecosystem.  Ultimately those people's histories of actual antisemitism (of which I'll readily acknowledge that there is plenty) are less important than their current vocalization of support to the pro Israel lobby. Again, going back to the "enemy of my enemy" thinking.

Because it makes housing more expensive to build. Which reduces supply and creates more inflation.   In the short term yes you get more folks out of a job which means lower wages and in theory lower inflation.  But if the goal is to free up some labor, instead of taking from the home construction business, why didn't we just expand public insurance and end some unnecessary middle man jobs while lowering the costs of the highest inflating sector over my lifetime: healthcare.    Somehow blocking an expansion of public healthcare makes one a moderate even though it leads to higher inflation and more profits to multi national corporations with foreign investors.    But doing stuff like raising taxes on 100 million Americans with children like Manchin did last year is actually more conservative and right wing than putting Americans first over multi national corporations.

Similar to requiring endorsements/license for driving a box truck.  Right now, it is a patchwork. Some states let you drive anything as long as it is non-commercial. Others have the 26,000lb GCWR limit for a CDL. There are plenty of stories out there for RV's weighting over 26,000lbs being driven with a standard drivers license. You have exemptions for Farmers to drive 80,000lb semi's locally without a CDL.  The type of vehicle doesn't really matter either. (as long as it isn't oversize). You can get box trucks under 26,000GVWR and those don't require CDLs at all. It is all about the vehicles weight rating to define where it falls. And to be clear, it is the rated capacity, not what it is loaded too. If the truck is 28,000 GVWR, it doesn't matter if it is empty and weighs 12,000lbs. It still requires a CDL.   What I would question is what is the safety need you are trying to address here. Is there a clear and significant safety hazard you are addressing with this added level of bureaucracy?  I am not sure there is that would justify this. To be clear though I would welcome a nationalized non-commercial CDL type license for heavier vehicles. If the goal is to de-incentivize truck ownership, I think you would fail because of the unintended consequences. The rent the truck at home-depot or the U-Haul moving trucks would all get put under this umbrella.  If you are pulling 10,000lbs or more I am not opposed to having to have an endorsement. This would mean the person would have to be exposed to the process to understand how to do it safely. With everyone believing the marketing tow ratings in this thread and very few understanding how to know if a vehicle/trailer is a safe combination, it may make sense in that regard.  Here is an interesting fact sheet for the 2023 F150  https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/brand_ford/en_us/brand/cpo/pdf/2023_Ford_F-150_Towing_Info_Dec16.pdf  Lets say I am looking to pull a 7,000 trailer. Call it a larger boat or small horse trailer. My tongue weight will be 700-1000lbs. Lets call it 850lbs. That comes directly off my available payload - which includes people and other equipment on the truck itself. If its a boat, lets add 2 adults and 2 kids. Say 600lbs. Boat toys, coolers, and the like add even more weight. Luggage? We may be near 2000lbs of payload here. We also have to make sure we aren't exceeding the gross combined weight rating. The most common truck out there is the supercrew 4x4. Once you start looking at the charts and including everything you have to, you find out not every F150 is going to be able to safely pull this even if the 'towing capacity' says it could.  For the record, I am a volunteer firefighter and drive large trucks (50,000lb), on my normal non-CDL license, with lights and sirens. This is not limited to straight trucks either, I have pulled a 28,000lb trailer full of equipment running lights/sirens too. I fully support creating a special CDL category for emergency responders. Driving and highways are the leading cause of death right now and there is a significant safety issue that could be addressed.

Progressives are pretty much without exception anti-theists.  You can be against Homosexual Marriage, but you didnt really answer my question. Okay, its Not a valid marriage in your eyes, but what does that even mean in the secular governmental context? If your church wont grant their marriage certificates, I dont care, they can go somewhere else, or just get the state recognized one done at the court house.  Your reply is dripping with progressive rhetoric. Its not in my eyes, its in the eyes of the body of Christ that is the church. Progressives are very fond of acting like everyone but them holds them objectively incorrect personal opinions and that they themselves are the true bearers of truth. This response clearly shows this bias by saying in your eyes. Just putting that out there. Any church that teaches otherwise is going against the grain. I agree that there is no way to verify whether or not this opinion is objective, but, as I said, progressives are far more fond of claiming to hold objective truth. A secular federal government should make no statements on marriage, by not recognizing any marriage. So our government isnt secular. Also, I wouldnt even support secularism on the municipal and regional level, only the federal level. Regions and municipalities should be free to decide how they will license personal relationships.  Allowing them state recognized marriages acts directly in opposition to the hook-up Culture that you rail against as well. Without the ability to legally and with the right churches, spiritually, be recognized as partners, part of the incentive to stay together falls away. And so if they cant marry, then they might as well just have sex with who and whatever and continue to live in degeneracy. Letting them get married helps decrease the ills you talk about.  All I have to say is, what? Your presupposing homosexual unions are somehow akin to heterosexual marriages, and therefore allowing them reduced hookup culture. Thats like saying we should allow men to marry their sisters, because otherwise its just furthering hook up culture by incentivizing them to do so outside marriage. Frankly, I dont care whether homosexuals stay together. Let me say it one more time. Homosexual  unions  arent  legitimate. Ideally, they shouldnt be together in the first place, let alone have children and be spiritually recognized as partners. Im not saying it should be illegal (progressives love to straw man conservatives, so Im assuming your going to respond with yOu WaNt To ArReSt gAy PeOpLe NoW tOo??!?!?) Its living in degeneracy to be an open homosexual regardless of whether theyre having sex with who and whatever. How about we focus on restoring the conditions for the real family to thrive, yeah?  And your adoption response didnt answer my question. Wether or not its the childs right to have A Male and Female parent or not, there are thousands of kids who go completely without parents. Are you really trying to say that have a loving home with two gays parents is somehow worse then growing up without any parents at all?  In thirty years when we have incestsexuals, will you prefer a child have a loving home of a man and his sister over an adoption center? No? Apply that logic to homosexuality. Its exactly the same.

Assuming we can reliably store CO2, whether in gaseous form, in rock, or in some other form, there are a number of ways we could get there.  One very interesting source is BECCS - carbon capture and storage for electricity or heat burning of biomass. This will be as sustainable - or unsustainable - as the biofuels it was sourced from. Obviously, it is limited by our rate of biofuel use.  In theory, this should take carbon from the air, turn it into plant, and then we'll burn it for energy or heat and capture the carbon exhaust - a carbon-negative cycle. In practice, it'll depend on the fuel (forestry byproducts, crop biofuels, algae, waste?) being sustainably grown, and on the captured carbon being properly stored.

This reminds me of what the British went through during the shelling on London. Only difference is the U.K did in fact have the means to defend itself and its borders. Lets call it what it is. This is Genocide in the 21st century. Egypt knew what Israel was capable of back in the 50s; a mere couple of years after the Zionist party took control of Palestinian land with western aid.  They did this of course under the guise of halting soviet expansion in the Middle East and because the U.S needed an operating post in the region and so it funded Israel. This was followed by a reneged promise on behalf of the U.S and Britain to aid Egypt in the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Egypt had no to choice but to nationalize the Suez Canal Company in 1956 in order to fund it and establish ties with communist Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. As a result, Britain, Newly formed Israel and France(angered by the fact that Egypt had helped the Algerians revolt French rule) all attacked Egypt in an attempt to regain control of the Suez. Not surprisingly both U.S and British troops used the excuse of enforcing UN peace resolution to invade. As a result of the Suez Crisis, Egypt remained ruler of the canal and Israel was denied access to it for trade but did regain shipping rights in the straights of Tiran; and both France and Britain lost most of their influence in the Middle East.   This war is still about the canal. Only that this time Israels allies want to do something about it. Like build a new one. And I wonder where it will be constructed

Maybe you don't understand, maybe you do, but in any case, I will say it here, other people may find it helpful as well: supporting/loving a country isn't tantamount to supporting specific government policies. Palestinians can hate their own government or governments and likewise being pro-Israel isn't tantamount to supporting specific Israeli government policies. A pro-Israel person can of course support policies that many people don't like ( rightly or not ),  but this support isn't the defining feature of being pro-Israel.   A lot of people online don't know what Zionism means and this is presumably the case here too.  Zionism is the movement for the self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people. There are no specific policies associated with Zionism. A Zionist can be in principle a communist, or far-right, but most are neither. If you believe being a Zionist means you necessarily support any set of government policies, you don't know what Zionism is. Likewise, anti-Zionism is not any opposition to any government policy, it is the opposition to Israel's existence itself, regardless of any Israeli policy. Although Anti-Zionists can be, and often are also opposed to Israeli government policies, this opposition is not the defining feature of anti-Zionism, but in many ways, the result of opposition to Israel's existence as well. Recent polls suggest that the majority of Israelis and Palestinians alike don't want a two state solution, and this is the result of distrust of the other side, not opposition to the idea of a Jewish and Palestinian state living alongside each other. I imagine Israeli settlers would be opposed to a Palestinian state, but they are a fringe minority and can thus be neglected. Most Israelis that are against a Palestinian state simply don't trust the prospective state to be peaceful.

The history of human "people" goes back about 300,000 years.  &#x200B;  >That makes IVF an unprecedented deviation from the way human eggs have been fertilized for tens of millions of years.  Yes, but it's only a small number of people using IVF, and the way human eggs have been fertilised in the past has often been far, far from ideal  **The "evolution" of the human species included:**  * men keeping women in harems against their will. Any of these men could have had genetic flaws that they spread among a vast number of people. I mean WHY do we have so many genetic disorders? Where did they all come from? It kind of goes against your argument that 'natural fertility' in evolution got rid of the disorders along the way. * men taking young girls in marriage and forcing pregnancy on them. Many girls who were not ready for childbirth died, who would have made healthy mothers had they been allowed to mature before marriage/sex. * Men who were past their prime taking girls/much younger women as wives. Older men have many more mutations in their sperm that men in their prime fertile years -- resulting in a much higher probability of babies with disorders. These days, men who are much older than the women they marry/partner with are far fewer in number, but such marriages used to be commonly forced on girls and young women in the past of humans. * men waging war and raping all the women/girls of a town. Even if these women/girls killed the resulting babies (which many did), many of the girls/women would have been infected by the STDs of the attacking men, which may have caused disorders in any future babies.  Against the above points, today's IVF doesn't seem such a big problem.  &#x200B;  >Im not suggesting that these impediments make them unworthy of the opportunity to have children, but I feel like we are glossing over the fact that a not-insignificant number of people who would otherwise not reproduce are now doing so.  Yes but we had a large number of men who should not have been reproducing who were doing so in the past (as per my points). Pregnancy that happened via force may be 'natural' but it's hardly desirable and has had a massive negative effect on the health of humans as a whole.  &#x200B;  >And, in any case, just because poor people cant readily access medical care like a rich person doesnt mean they should also be barred from IVF.  I agree, but I understand IVF is hugely expensive. Those who can afford it have been the guinea pigs who have undergone hugely invasive, painful, disruptive and traumatic procedures (almost entirely the women). The science is getting better and better and by the time it's more widely offered to people, it should be far better and easier and cheaper. So in that way, it'll be a win in the future for future infertile couples.

Salinity increases as evaporation occurs from each pool the salt water passes through until it reaches a point where microbes cant survive to decompose the algae and return the CO2 to the atmosphere. The salinity will also destroy the cell walls of the algae releasing those yummy hydrocarbons. Salt doesnt dissolve into hydrocarbons which will cause them to naturally separate for the hydrocarbons to be pumped underground while leaving the salt on the surface.  This also doesnt use fresh water and is scalable through the addition of more pools. The energy used to agitate the water, run the pumps, and deter wildlife from interacting with the pools can be provided by solar and wind development along the pipeline itself. The algae capturing the carbon are provided energy by the sun eliminating power requirements for the actual capture itself.  This also makes adding limiting nutrients to the pools to spike algal growth much simpler. I think the most difficult part would be identifying a corridor along which the pipeline could run that doesnt put the water table at risk and ends in a proper disposal site. A salt flat would be ideal. While I believe that is certainly necessary, a leak in such a pipeline would do minimal damage compared to current oil pipelines.  Algal pools are second only to closed algal loops for sequestering CO2, at least according to a department of energy report on biofuels I read like five years ago. This also uses substantially less land than would be required for trees to remove an equivalent amount of CO2.  Finally, this can be implemented today and continue to reduce atmospheric CO2 after reaching net zero with no changes to the infrastructure.

It doesn't say that. The right to keep and bear arms clearly belongs to the people.  We have court cases going all the way back to 1822 with Bliss vs Commonwealth reaffirming our individual right to keep and bear arms.   Here's an excerpt from that decision.   >If, therefore, the act in question imposes any restraint on the right, immaterial what appellation may be given to the act, whether it be an act regulating the manner of bearing arms or any other, the consequence, in reference to the constitution, is precisely the same, and its collision with that instrument equally obvious.  >  >And can there be entertained a reasonable doubt but the provisions of the act import a restraint on the right of the citizens to bear arms? The court apprehends not. **The right existed at the adoption of the constitution; it had then no limits short of the moral power of the citizens to exercise it**, and it in fact consisted in nothing else but in the liberty of the citizens to bear arms. Diminish that liberty, therefore, and you necessarily restrain the right; and such is the diminution and restraint, which the act in question most indisputably imports, by prohibiting the citizens wearing weapons in a manner which was lawful to wear them when the constitution was adopted. In truth, the right of the citizens to bear arms, has been as directly assailed by the provisions of the act, as though they were forbid carrying guns on their shoulders, swords in scabbards, or when in conflict with an enemy, were not allowed the use of bayonets; and if the act be consistent with the constitution, it cannot be incompatible with that instrument for the legislature, by successive enactments, to entirely cut off the exercise of the right of the citizens to bear arms. For, in principle, there is no difference between a law prohibiting the wearing concealed arms, and a law forbidding the wearing such as are exposed; and if the former be unconstitutional, the latter must be so likewise.   >Nunn v. Georgia (1846)   >The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear arms of every description, and not such merely as are used by the militia, shall not be infringed, curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this right, originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Carta!

So higher tax rates often lead businesses to increase their investments into their company (raising expenses which lowers profit and thus taxes, while still keeping the value in the company through reinvestment/growth).   So this could lead to increased hiring, increased purchasing of new equipment or property, spending on innovation or R&D etc. All things that can help the economy further.   When taxes are low on the other hand there is more incentive to take as much profit as possible through lower expenses/reinvesting and then taking that money out of the business and sticking it in an external investment.

On a similar note, increased minimum wage actually hurts those that already make more because they're not raised to compensate. so, increase in inflation by the raise in the minimum, would actually bring the economy down since ALL wages are not going up.

This is the thing about America, I might be convinced by this argument if the guy elected after the first black president wasn't Donald Trump. Large swaths of the country oppose progressive policies, not just conservatives either. How can you live in a country where Republicans are succeeding at destroying our social safety net and say that.  This is going to make it hard to accomplish anything when there is a lack of political will (even among some liberals), and conservatives are favored by the Senate, Electoral College, House, and even the courts.  >He did nothing that has an immediate effect on people's lives, so he's going to lose. For 2 years trump (I know not him specifically but you get what I mean) gave everyone thousands of dollars and boosted the stock market (artificially ofc) which made people feel better. Nothing Biden has done has made people feel better.  This isn't completely true, he did immediately helped people after being elected.  Second, his support for policies that benefit the country in the longterm and not immediately is something that should be praised from any candidate.  Third, if swing voters "feel" Trump did a better job than Biden, then why will they vote for another candidate that isn't Trump but is from the same party as Biden.  Most people who "feel" Trump did a better job compare life before the COVID pandemic to today and argue that all the issues we have today are Biden's fault. This is indicative of how short of an attention span the average person has.  As desirable as Progressive policies and candidates are, the fuel motivating right-wing populism will not be extinguished by Democrats embracing left-wing populism. The rise in Trump voters is largely to do with anxieties about cultural change, demographics, and religion. Some of his support could be chalked up to economic difficulties, but the working class people who jumped ship for Trump in 2016 were mostly concerned about Free Trade shipping jobs overseas and migrants taking their jobs. These guys don't want a revolution, they want stability.

In effect you're arguing an undemocratic regime can do whatever it wants because it hasn't held an election.  Despite Germany holding its last contested election in March 1933, that didn't prevent the UK and France from declaring war in September 1939 and the US from declaring war in December 1941.

In a speech titled Two Years to Save the World, Stiell emphasized that governments, development banks and business leaders must take steps to avert much more serious impacts of the climate crisis within that time frame, reported Reuters.  For those who say that climate change is only one of many priorities, like ending poverty, ending hunger, ending pandemics, or improving education, I simply say this: none of these crucial tasks  indeed none of the Sustainable Development Goals  will be possible unless we get the climate crisis under control, Stiell said in the speech, delivered at London thinktank Chatham House.  According to the UN, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent by 2030 is essential to keep global heating to within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels. However, for 10 consecutive months, global temperatures have reached record highs, the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service said.  As of today, national climate plans  called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs   in aggregate will barely cut emissions at all by 2030, Stiell said. We still have a chance to make greenhouse gas emissions tumble, with a new generation of national climate plans. But we need these stronger plans, now. And while every country must submit a new plan, the reality is G20 emissions are around 80% of global emissions.

So far full renewable is only on paper (and for very blessed counties like Iceland or Norway who can rely on massive hydro for small population ; and everyone who can emulate that should).    France, Sweden the past, UAE, China, Russia have demonstrated that it can be fast today too. Why don't we learn from them instead of "it works but it's old".       It's only "based on fossil fuel" if you accept the false dichotomy that nuclear later prevent renewable now.     Yes, renewable are the short term fix for today's fossil; nuclear is the insurance policy to make sure you won't need fossil the future (if you fail to do better than what the world renewable champions already struggle to acheive) .       You can have South Australia, Denmark or Portugal, 150gCO2/kWh "renewable based energy system". Or France 60 gCO2/kWh.       I'm not sure "it was more expensive" will fly much as an excuse when the shit hit the climate fan.

Those are the means we have on Earth to grant a person a path to redemption. We may believe there is judgment after life, but that can apply to many more, not just those sentenced by human law and our courts, so the debate is about how to organize human affairs.   Furthermore, our institutions are imperfect. The vote is an individual's way in a democracy to change human law and institutions governed by those laws. We should be reluctant to let laws evermore be in the hands of experts or persons who are inoffensive in the eyes of imperfect institutions. A person can be punished for bad reasons. So humility should make us avoid constructing punishments that cannot be atoned in the eyes of human law.  On an entirely practical level, I think this is an issue about a small number. The statistics I have seen from some European countries that allow criminals to vote show extremely low turnout in said group, even when social-economic status, age and ethnicity are accounted for. The fraction of sentenced criminals that wish to atone and return to society as good citizens should be given every chance to do so, even if that implies the symbolically undesirable thing of granting bad persons a right to direct the government of the common good. Since they are unlikely to exercise the right, and more likely to engage in bad acts by other means than voting, I see at most a very small practical loss in allowing criminals to vote.

Like it or not, but extracting more coal in Europe right now will have a net positive effect for the climate vs importing more. Focus should be in reducing consumption.  And politicians clearly think the German population won't approve of reduced energy usage, and thus are burning yet more coal after their investment in a genocidal regime gave negative diplomatic and energy returns.

Best solution is localizing production;   such as dismantling national/international firms, including (and especially) energy firms (such as oil and coal).

Trumps New York case involves an alleged scheme to prevent potentially damaging stories about his personal life from becoming public during his 2016 presidential campaign.  Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Trump last year with falsifying internal records kept by his company, the Trump Organization, to hide the true nature of payments made to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, for helping bury stories alleging Trump had extramarital sexual encounters  The case centers on payoffs to two women, porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about Trump having a child out of wedlock  The Trump Organization then reimbursed Cohen at an amount far more than what hed spent, prosecutors said. The company logged the payments  delivered in monthly installments and a year-end bonus check  as legal expenses, prosecutors said...  The records at issue include general ledger entries, invoices and checks that prosecutors say were falsified.  WHAT IS TRUMP CHARGED WITH?  Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records Because it is a state case, Trump would not be able to pardon himself if he were to become president again. Presidential pardons only apply to federal crimes
