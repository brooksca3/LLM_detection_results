Baghdad, 20 December 2021 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Iraq welcomes an additional EUR 1.5 million (US$ 1.7 million) contribution from the Government of Finland to its flagship programme the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS). The critical support will bolster ongoing efforts to stabilize the five governorates liberated from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Since 2015, the FFS has supported over 3,000 projects, restoring essential services, supporting livelihoods, building municipal capacity and fostering cohesion in areas liberated from ISIL. “UNDP’s ability to deliver to the highest standard at speed and scale makes us the development partner of choice. This would not be possible without the continuous and generous support from international partners such as the Government of Finland,” says UNDP Resident Representative for Iraq, Zena Ali Ahmed. “However, critical stabilization needs remain as over 1 million people are still internally displaced, including the hardest-to-return populations. The Government of Finland’s contribution comes at an important time in Iraq’s recovery from years of conflict, as the country looks to safeguard the hard-won stabilization gains and prevent ISIL’s resurgence,” adds Ms. Ali Ahmad. “Finland has been supporting the Facility since 2016 and we are proud to renew our commitment. UNDP and its partners have achieved many concrete results during these years, but Iraq still faces a multitude of challenges. Finland is a long-standing and solutions-oriented partner to Iraq,” says Ville Skinnari, Finland’s Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade. To date, FFS projects are estimated to have benefitted more than 6 million individuals in the target areas with 17.5 million benefits accruing to them, mostly in Ninewa and Salah al-Din, and in sectors such as electricity, health and water. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
The Ambassador of Italy to Jordan, Fabio Cassese, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Representative in Jordan, Nabil Assaf, signed today a EUR 1 million agreement to increase the resilience of the Jordanian vulnerable communities through the Italy-funded “Sustainable Production and Utilization of Agro-natural Resources (SPUAR)” project, during a ceremony attended by the Head of Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) Amman, Emilio Cabasino. The initiative targets vulnerable communities and their access to socio-economic infrastructures in the governorate of Ma’an, which is the largest in Jordan and, according to the poverty report issued by the Jordanian Department of Statistics, one of the poorest governorates in the Country, with a poverty ratio of 27%. “In recognition of the importance to support the agriculture sector and sustainable management of natural resources in a Country like Jordan challenged by desertification, drought and land degradation“, said Ambassador Cassese, “Italy’s partnership with FAO focuses on actions to counteract the detrimental impact of resource scarcity upon human development and poverty”. The scarcity of water resources is indeed one of the main challenges for Jordan and a limiting factor for economic development, especially for the agriculture sector. The demand on water resources is increasing with time for both agriculture and non-agricultural purposes, as the agricultural sector consumes around 510 million cubic meters (51%) of the annual available fresh water. “In response to the current water scarcity status in Jordan, this project will be implemented in Southern Jordan targeting the most vulnerable households in Ma’an governorate with an enabling environment for women's enhanced participation, by establishing non-conventional water resources from collecting rain water for the benefit of agriculture and the enhancement of the well-being of the targeted beneficiaries”, said Mr Nabil Assaf. The initiative aims to establish a sustainable enterprise using the agro-natural resources (land, water, vegetation) available in the targeted governorate. “Within the two-year project,” added Mr Cabasino, “we aim to target a total of 120 households (660 persons), including female headed households, youth and people with disabilities, with actions that include rooftop water harvesting systems and provision of food processing equipment, as well as a capacity building programme to equip beneficiaries with the necessary skills to maximize the use of agro-natural resources and enhance their livelihood”. In addition to improved food security and income-generation opportunities, the project will result in soil and water conservation through their sustainable management, and will ultimately contribute to empower local rural communities.
Timely and reliable disaggregated data and official statistics are critical for understanding, managing, and mitigating the health, social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. They are also essential for designing effective, evidence-based responses to the crisis and to drive an inclusive and sustainable recovery, that leaves no one behind. While data is critical for policymaking in ‘normal times’, the pandemic has served to further elevate the importance of data to save lives and to recover better. Cambodia has made progress in increasing the availability of data, however significant data gaps exist, including in the level of disaggregation required, geographical coverage and timeliness.[1] The United Nations has prioritised assistance to the Royal Government of Cambodia to improve the quality, accessibility and disaggregation of data and statistics. The United Nations is working to strengthen national capacity to enable this and is contributing to the production of reliable data that is needed to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Assistance also centres on improving national capacity for the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other national indicators to foster achievement of the 2030 Agenda. In line with this, the United Nations is supporting the Ministry of Planning and the National Institute of Statistics, as well as line Ministries to improve the availability and utilization of data for sustainable development including to better link data to planning and budgeting processes. The focus has been on providing support for the implementation and roll out of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) to enhance statistical systems in line with international standards. The United Nations is also supporting the collection of key statistical data through national census, demographic, social and economic surveys, and administrative data systems that will provide quality data for use in monitoring national development frameworks and to guide policy direction. This incorporates support for the Government’s SDG monitoring and reporting along with the setup of the National Development/SDGs Indicators Reporting and Data Exchange among Government line ministries through the National Platform - CAMSTAT which includes a CSDG/SDG tracking portal. In the current context of the pandemic, reliable data will be essential to support SDG acceleration efforts to enable Cambodia to remain on track to achieve the SDGs. The United Nations has carried out a series of rapid assessments and surveys, together with its partners to collect data to better understand the varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health, society and the economy especially for vulnerable groups. This has included impact assessments and surveys to glean data on the impact of the pandemic on children, women, youth, people with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, sexual reproductive health, returning migrants, garment workers, informal workers, as well as on small and medium enterprises. Many of the surveys have been undertaken in several rounds and intervals and have contributed to informing government policymaking and programme adjustment to better respond to the evolving COVID 19 situation. The United Nations is also contributing quality data through regular household-based data collection to measure the evolution of food security and nutrition and the effectiveness of mitigation measures in Cambodia. The United Nations carries out remote price and market monitoring in cooperation with the Agricultural Marketing Office (AMO) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and produces monthly monitoring reports (Cambodia Market Update) that provide data and insights on price trends, market functionality and supply chains, agricultural production to understand prevailing market conditions and the implications for households in Cambodia and Government policy responses. The United Nations collects monthly agricultural production data on Cambodia to provide early warning through the Global Information and Early Warning System. This monitoring continues through the COVID-19 pandemic and gives a snapshot of the Earth Observation Indicators targeting seasonal indicators, vegetation indicators, and precipitation indicators. The United Nations agency - World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Health of Cambodia prepare regular COVID-19 situation reports to highlight the most recent developments in the health response to COVID-19. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the United Nations has also supported the Royal Government to track the number of Cambodian returning migrants and the situation at borders and in quarantine to inform more effective policy responses. The United Nations is also working on shock responsive social assistance connecting IDPoor data, with the social protection system and the national disaster management system. Support has also been provided for a range of information management systems such as the Child Protection Information Management System; and Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM). The United Nations worked with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to build some of the first models able to estimate COVID19’s social and economic impact. This work showed how stimulus packages that included social protection not only improve GDP but significantly reduce poverty and unemployment. Further work revealed how reduced access to education due to pandemic conditions caused a reduction in Cambodia’s Human Development Index. To promote wide access to data, the United Nations hosts a public Reports Dashboard, which contains the latest published and upcoming research and assessments on Cambodia, drawn from various partners. This includes research on the impacts of COVID 19. As of 5 July 2021, 168 completed and ongoing assessments were included in the dashboard. The dashboard provides visualizations and simple analytics of reports. It helps to assess and identify knowledge gaps; create benchmarks to track progress in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted challenges and vulnerabilities in data production and systems. The Royal Government of Cambodia, with support from its partners, has made efforts to generate data and evidence to inform policy decision and programme adjustments. In this light, the United Nations encourages the authorities to continue its efforts to strengthen national data and statistical systems to ensure that data can better contribute to leaving no one behind and to fostering equality and sustainable development. To effectively do this, data production systems must respond more effectively and quickly to the changing environment and better anticipate risks. The United Nations encourages better use of digital technologies, innovation, and new data sources to provide more timely data. The United Nations also encourages the authorities to promote greater data literacy and data governance. Highlighting the crucial role data plays in the pandemic response, the United Nations urges the authorities to ensure a balance between protecting public health and the right to privacy. Adequate data privacy and protection of personal information are achieved through appropriate legal and policy measures. At the same time balancing and respecting the importance of ensuring transparency and accessibility to data that is in the public interest is crucial. It is important to adopt a holistic and whole-of-government approach to data governance with the engagement of all stakeholders and partners across sectors. Greater effort is required to overcome data silos and priority should be placed on enhancing the capacity for the collection of disaggregated data to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable groups that are most impacted by the pandemic. The United Nations will continue to partner with the Royal Government and other partners to improve the availability, timeliness and utilization of quality data and statistics necessary to respond to the pandemic, future crisis and to accelerate action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The concentrators deliver pure, high quality oxygen with the appropriate concentration vital for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with low blood oxygen levels. These items are supplied upon the request of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to support COVID-19 response. The Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic plans to distribute the oxygen concentrators across the country. “The donation is part of the COVID-19 response and mitigating its impact on the health system in the country. It is envisaged that the support will contribute towards strengthening the health care system and provide an added impetus to our joint efforts in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic”, highlighted Dr Nazira Artykova WHO Representative in Kyrgyzstan. “The Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic expresses its gratitude to the World Health Organization for the assistance and support provided to the health care system of the Kyrgyz Republic. WHO provides comprehensive assistance to Kyrgyzstan in the fight against COVID-19. We have already received several shipments of humanitarian aid. We hope that our joint and fruitful work for the benefit of preserving the health of our citizens will be successfully continued”, noted Dr Madamin Karataev, Deputy Minister of Health. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO had delivered to Kyrgyzstan personal protective equipment and provided PCR test kits for COVID-19 response and laboratory confirmation of positive results. In addition, WHO had handed over supplies of laboratory consumables for sample collection and testing (tubes, swabs, kits, reagents, etc.). WHO supports the Ministry of Health with e-learning training cycles for healthcare workers, including laboratory, primary health, hospital and public health specialists to respond to COVID-19. Information: this assistance is provided as part of the joint humanitarian response under the Disaster Response Coordination Unit, which was activated on 16 March 2020 following the request of the Government to assist her in emergency preparedness and response for COVID-19 and setting a stage for early recovery. Chaired by the UN Resident Coordinator, the DRCU prioritizes and channels its support under six priority sectors: early recovery, education, food security and logistics, health, protection, and joint sector for water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and non-food items (NFI). The DRCU was set up in 2008 and its inter-agency teams comprise representatives of government ministries, UN agencies, international and local NGOs and representatives of donor community.

Digital technology and innovation can help us deal with complex global challenges and achieve sustainable prosperity for humanity and our planet. But they can also drive us apart and fuel inequality. Digital technology and innovation at large is transforming our world. Faster internet, satellite data and imagery, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made our lives and economies unrecognizable from just a generation ago. These technologies can help us deal with complex global challenges and achieve sustainable prosperity for humanity and our planet. But they can also drive us apart and fuel inequality. As governments adapt to this rapidly-changing technological environment, so must UNDP if it is to remain a trusted and effective partner. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union (AU) 2063 Agenda are ambitious plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. The achievement of these goals would be enhanced by the full implementation of the AU’s 10-year Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA-2024) that considers science, technology and innovation as multi-function tools and enablers for achieving continental development goals. Regrettably, it is clear that the actions we are taking in terms of science, technology and innovation are not yet making an impact across critical sectors such as agriculture, energy, environment, health, infrastructure development, mining, security and water among others that contribute to Africa’s transformation, , nor at the scale and pace needed to achieve the 17 Goals. We all must join forces, with multi-stakeholder platforms as the one that TICAD represents for Africa, and leverage new opportunities in science, technology and innovation to create the continent we are all striving for. The potential of STI in Africa rests on building and/or upgrading research infrastructures; enhancing professional and technical competencies; promoting entrepreneurship and innovation; and providing an enabling environment for STI development across Africa. There are emerging opportunities to accelerate progress in this regard, particularly in terms of what is sometimes referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution – demonstrating the magnitude of the change –, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchains and machine learning are transforming societies, economies, public and private sector organizations, and individuals across the globe. These emerging technologies have the potential to advance sustainable development and lead to greater development impact – while also presenting a risk to drive us apart and fuel inequality. As such, mobilizing public, private and donor resources to finance Research and Development and creating an enabling environment for multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration in open Innovation and Entrepreneurship remains the key to accelerating Africa’s transition to an innovation-led, Knowledge-based Economy. Fostering innovation for accelerated socio-economic gain is now a priority for UNDP in Africa and our organization has just launched its first Digital Strategy, which is a call to action and innovation both for UN and our network of partners. Financing the SDGs – both through public and private resources – is at the core of UNDP’s efforts. As a systemic challenge, it demands the re-orientation of how public and private actors interact with each other to achieve the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. The required collective efforts by governments, the private sector, philanthropy and civil society as well as the necessary re-shaping of markets to become more inclusive, equitable and sustainable must make use of technological advances and innovative financing approaches, in particular financing schemes that combine the resources and technical expertise of both the public and private sector. Turning to intra-African trade, which has recently received a boost through the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and can promote inclusion and equality, digitization can lower barriers to entry and help connect Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with global markets and value chains, providing the necessary services to facilitate their exports, such as simplified payments and logistics. With the right policies in place, e-commerce in Africa could reach 75 billion USD by 2025 and could be of particular benefit to MSMEs, which constitute more than 80 per cent of African enterprises. Overwhelming successes are already emerging, such as Jumia, the “African Amazon”, which has become the continent’s first unicorn being valued at over 1 billion USD. However, for trade to take full advantage of technology and innovation, African countries must first close the digital divide and increase access to technologies in order to ensure the broader adoption of digital technologies. African governments need to pursue industrialization by combining physical and digital infrastructure improvements. Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires urgent investments in human capital development that is tailored to the changing needs of businesses. With the rise in new technologies and automation globally, the continent is primed to exploit such opportunities because of a young and more educated population. YouthConnekt Africa, a multi-dimensional youth empowerment programme implemented in approx. ten African countries, and the complementary YAS! Youth for Africa and SDGs initiative that focuses on youth entrepreneurship on the continental level, are clear examples of this approach that UNDP supports. The possibilities that are emerging to advance sustainable development in Africa by strategically applying science, technology and innovation – in SDG financing and trade, and beyond. UNDP is committed to work together to ensure this digital revolution leads to revolutionary solutions to the complex problems facing our word, including Africa.

UN Secretary-General emphasized on our responsibility to join with girls in all their diversity, amplify their power and solutions as digital change-makers, and address the obstacles they face in the digital space The strength, health and empowerment of the world’s girls is a matter for every single day of the year. The International Day of the Girl is an opportunity to recommit to this global imperative. Today’s girls are part of a digital generation. It is our responsibility to join with them in all their diversity, amplify their power and solutions as digital change-makers, and address the obstacles they face in the digital space. The path to girls’ digital equality is steep. A massive gap in internet use spanning geographies and generations has grown from 11 per cent in 2013 to 17 per cent six years later. In more than two thirds of all countries, girls make up only 15 percent of graduates in STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering and math. Girls have equal ability and immense potential in these fields, and when we empower them, everyone benefits. I saw this long before I began my political career, when I was a teacher in Lisbon and witnessed the power of education to uplift individuals and communities. That experience has guided my vision for gender equality in education ever since. Investments in closing the digital gender divide yield huge dividends for all. The United Nations is committed to working with girls so that this generation, whoever they are and whatever their circumstances, can fulfil their potential. The Generation Equality Action Coalition on Technology and Innovation is our new platform, where governments, civil society, the private sector and young leaders are coming together around collective initiatives and investments to support girls’ digital access, skills and creativity. Together, let us ensure that girls play their full part in the digital generation to design and secure our common future.
The world marks the 30th anniversary of the International Day of Older Persons as we reckon with the disproportionate and severe impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has wrought on older persons around the world – not only on their health, but on their rights and well-being. Older people must be a priority in our efforts to overcome COVID-19. In keeping with the theme of this year’s commemoration, we must also examine how the pandemic might change how we address age and ageing in our societies. Expanding opportunities for older persons and increasing their access to health, pensions and social protection will be crucial. This year’s observance falls as the world is also marking the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife, which highlights the vital role of health and social workers, such as nurses and midwives, in responding to the pandemic. The majority of them are women, including many older persons. These are the people who devote their lives to our care, and to the care of older persons, mothers and children, and deserve far greater support. As we seek to recover better together, we must make concerted efforts across the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2020-2030 to improve the lives of older persons, their families and communities. The potential of older persons is a powerful basis for sustainable development. More than ever, we must listen to their voices, suggestions and ideas to build more inclusive and age-friendly societies. UNESCO, PCRWR and partners launch reports on UN World Water Development 2020; Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain Islamabad, 30 September — UNESCO Islamabad in partnership with Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), and in collaboration with The Asia Foundation, theUnited States Agency for International Development and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) launched two reports; the UN World Water Development Report 2020, and PCRWR’s Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain. The launch was followed by a stakeholder consultation for the development of the “Groundwater Management Plan” for Pakistan. The consultation aims to help the government of Pakistan with the long-term management of groundwater resources. The World Water Development Report 2020 sheds light on the impact of climate change on the availability, quality and quantity of water needed for basic human needs, thus undermining the basic rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for billions of people. Such a situation will also hinder the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6, that ensures access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all. This presents a considerable challenge as 2.2 billion people currently do not have access to safely managed drinking water, and 4.2 billion, or 55% of the world's population, are without safely managed sanitation. The report on Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain provides information on areas where groundwater is under stress due to water depletion and quality deterioration. The report also identifies areas where usable groundwater is available. This information will help the stakeholders in future groundwater management. Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, Federal Minister for Science and Technology in his remarks said that the present government has substantially increased the water resources development budget of the country. Ms. Patricia McPhillips, UNESCO Representative in Pakistan, Dr. Muhammad Ashraf, Chairman, PCRWR, Mr. Muhammad Nawaz, USAID and Mr. Farid Alam, Director Programs, The Asia Foundation spoke on different aspects of water and climate change.

Kigali, 21 June 2021 - Ange Kagame joins the ‘Parenting Month’ campaign in Rwanda by sharing tips for parents on how to boost their babies’ brain development through play. A month-long campaign was launched on 1 June 2021, by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion, National Child Development Agency, UNICEF, and other partners to promote positive parenting. In the video, Ange Kagame talks about how a baby’s brain develops most in the first 1,000 days at a pace never repeated again. She also highlights the role of both parents, male and female in the overall development of their baby. In the earliest years of life, a child’s brain develops at an astounding speed of more than 1 million new neural connections every second. This period offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape a child’s ability to learn, grow, form healthy relationships, and contribute fully to society in adulthood. Parents are the key providers of health, nutrition, stimulation, opportunities for early learning, and protection that babies need for healthy brain development. Another area where parents can contribute significantly to a child’s development is by playing with the baby. This helps babies learn and build crucial life skills – from problem-solving to expressing ideas – and strengthening the bond between child and parent. Parenting is one of the most challenging jobs in the world and now COVID-19 has placed even more pressure on parents and caregivers to support their children’s learning and development, keep their households functioning, and look after their families’ wellbeing. The video explains the various techniques such as ‘serve and return’ that parents can use to strengthen their bond with their babies while ensuring their holistic development. UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, to build a better world for everyone. For more information about UNICEF and its work for children, visit www.unicef.org.
The EU-UN Spotlight Initiative is committed to fostering regional mobilization and movement for transformative change on the elimination of violence against women and girls to develop and leverage the Action Coalition. The regional consultation allowed presenting the Action Coalition and its goals to key players in the field of elimination gender-based violence in the region, identifying their needs and strengthening coordination, creating opportunities for women's organizations and movements to make meaningful contributions to the fulfillment of the obligations of the Coalition members. “The Spotlight Initiative, as a global, multi-year partnership between the European Union and the United Nations to end violence against women and girls, creates a strong ground to contribute to the Generation Equality targets and to bring other member states and partners to unite the joint game-changing forces.” – said UN Resident Coordinator for Kazakhstan Michaela Friberg-Storey. In March 2021, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan expressed their intention to join the Action Coalition on Gender-Based violence launched during the Generation Equality Forum. The Action Coalition developed a set of concrete, ambitious and transformative actions that the members of the Action Coalition will take, with time and resource commitments, in order to achieve immediate and irreversible progress towards gender equality. Addressing the audience Johannes Stenbaek Madsen, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Kazakhstan, noted: “The European Union is strongly committed to gender equality, the empowerment of women of all ages, the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls and always promote the notion of equal rights and equal opportunities, both within Europe and globally. Gender equality is a core value of the European Union and a universally recognized human right, enshrined in EU law for more than 60 years and a key priority in the Union’s internal and external policies.” The ultimate goal of the Spotlight Initiative is to create an environment where there is zero tolerance for sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices, which the national stakeholders and an estimated 35 million women and girls in the five Central Asian countries and Afghanistan will contribute to and benefit from. The Spotlight Initiative (SI) is a global, multi-year partnership between European Union and United Nations to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by 2030. In Central Asia and Afghanistan the Spotlight Initiative is addressing legislative and policy gaps, strengthening institutions, promoting gender-equitable attitudes, and providing quality services for survivors. Interventions are also strengthening systems for collecting data on violence against women and girls and women’s movements. The Initiative joins existing efforts and complements the work of regional institutions and diverse partners. Find out more on www.spotlightinitiative.org The European Union is made up of 28 Member States who have decided to gradually link together their know-how, resources and destinies. Together, during a period of enlargement of 50 years, they have built a zone of stability, democracy and sustainable development whilst maintaining cultural diversity, tolerance and individual freedoms. The European Union is committed to sharing its achievements and its values with countries and peoples beyond its borders.
The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu is very concerned at pronouncements from officials in Montenegro questioning the commission of the crime of genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1995. She also notes a series of concerning developments in that country that contribute to sowing fear, mistrust and hate. Genocide and other atrocity crimes must not be a matter of any kind of arbitration, especially those legally processed based on evidence. The terrible events that occurred at Srebrenica in July 1995 have been adjudicated by the ICTY and ICJ. Both the ICTY and the International Court of Justice have concluded that the acts committed at Srebrenica constituted genocide. There is simply no space for denial or relativization of Srebrenica genocide and the legitimacy of the ICTY. The Secretary-General, in his message on the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina last year, called on “everyone in the region and beyond to counter hate speech and the rhetoric of division and narratives of mistrust and fear”. He noted that acknowledging the past is a vital step towards rebuilding trust, and that reconciliation means rejecting denial of genocide and war crimes and of any effort to glorify convicted war criminals. It also means recognizing the suffering of all victims and not attributing collective guilt. The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide would like to remind that genocide denial divides people, communities and states; it feeds on and strengthens contested narratives about the past, the present and the future. It also undermines the judicial decisions that have been made and therefore undermines justice. Denying the genocide in Srebrenica constitutes an attack on human dignity, particularly to the victims and survivors. It is unacceptable and must be condemned. Alice Wairimu Nderitu has been appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres as Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide on 10 November 2020.
In the annual meeting, the delegations of the countries analyzed the implementation of the Action Plan (Roadmap) for the implementation of the Framework for strengthening regional cooperation of Central Asian countries in the field of DRR and emergency situations in 2019-2021 adopted by the 2019 Regional Forum - Meeting of Heads of NDMAs. The national delegations reiterated the importance of preparedness for the new emerging threats such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reiterated the value of exchange of information and experience in building capacity for reducing the possible losses. The programme of the Forum included presentation of the first draft of the Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction, developed by CESDRR within the EU-funded Initiative. The strategy, aiming at reducing risk of cross-border scale and nature, calls for better exchange of information, joint risk assessment, building capacity of emergency management organizations, raising awareness of the existing and possible new hazards. “We realize the importance of resilience at all levels, the importance of a strategy for regional cooperation, because not a single country can protect its population all by itself from the pandemic or from other threats”, stated Boobek Azhikeyev, Minister of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyz Republic. “It is inspiring to see how Central Asia countries come together to share experiences, lessons learned and good practices. Just recently, in September this year, all five countries met to share experience and to coordinate actions for overcoming the COVID-19, together with international organizations. The work of the CESDRR is another concrete example of these critical efforts’, said Mr. Octavian Bivol Chief Regional Office for Europe, UNDRR. “Next year is an important one for Member States for developing a resilient, green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening risk reduction initiatives, and improving governance. Disaster risk reduction is an investment to ensure that “never again” will we suffer such devastating consequences, whether from a biological hazard like COVID-19 or climate change. “Strengthening resilience to potential natural disasters at all levels, from community to governments, has been an essential part of European Union’s disaster risk reduction efforts in Central Asia. Since 2003, European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO) has continuously implemented activities under its disaster preparedness program known as DIPECHO. Over the years, with a total of approximately 47 mln Euro and more than 110 projects, DIPECHO managed to promote DRR in Central Asian countries.” - said Johannes Madsen, Head of Cooperation in Central Asia. The Regional Forum adopted the outcome document, resolving to: acknowledge the information on the activities in disaster risk reduction in the region; further consolidate and enhance regional coordination; review the draft Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction for 2022 – 2030 and the draft Regional Risk Profile and contribute in their finalization. Central Asian states expressed willingness to work together in order to strengthen risk reduction governance and to reduce existing and future risks. The Regional Forum brought together National Emergency Management Organizations, Sendai Focal Points, international organizations working in the area of emergency response and risk reduction, representatives of the European Union and UN system organizations. The EU funded project “Strengthening disaster resilience and accelerating implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central Asia”, implemented by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), aims to support countries of the region in implementing Sendai Framework priorities. The project supports strengthening regional coordination, including development of regional DRR strategy, regional data loss database, and enhancing the role of CESDRR as the center of excellence, the secretariat of regional platform for DRR, and a hub for regional coordination. The support on national level includes assistance in developing/adjusting national DRR strategies, disaster loss database, and establishment of national platforms for DRR. On the local level, the project will support assessment of resilience of major cities to disasters. For this project the EU committed EURO 3,750,000 for the three yeas implementation.

World Bank/Visual News Associate | Women in Pakistan learn computing skills[/caption] The COVID-19 pandemic is “interrupting efforts” to achieve gender equality and threatening to “reverse hard-won gains” over the past decades, a senior UN official said on Tuesday. Introducing the 2020 edition of The World’s Women: Trends and Statistics, Liu Zhenmin, chief of the UN’s economic and social affairs department (DESA), said that over the last two decades, “attitudes of discrimination are slowly changing” and women’s lives have improved with regard to education, early marriage, childbearing and maternal mortality, all while progress has stagnated in other areas. “Women are far from having an equal voice to men”, spelled out the DESA chief. “And, in every region of the world, women are still subjected to various forms of violence and harmful practices”. Overall, progress continues to fall far short of what Member States committed themselves to, at the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women. “Twenty-five years since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, progress towards equal power and equal rights for women remains elusive”, said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. To effectively measure progress in that regard, reliable, timely and disaggregated, data are critically needed and closing data gaps requires regular collection and use of gender statistics. Mr. Liu pointed out that while the coronavirus pandemic is having “devastating social and economic impacts” across the world, women are fighting “on the front lines…in healthcare settings, in home care, in the family and in the public sphere”. With less internet access, particularly in developing regions, women also face difficulties maintaining valuable personal connections and carrying on day-to-day activities during lockdowns. “Many may also have been trapped in unsafe environments…and at risk of experiencing intimate partner violence”, Mr. Liu stated. Moreover, he pointed out that women face reduced access to sexual and reproductive health services; and need more time to care for the elderly, sick and children, including home-based education; adding that they are also at higher risk of infection than men in the workplace. In terms of power and decision making, World’s Women 2020 revealed that last year, women held only 28 per cent of managerial positions globally – almost the same proportion as in 1995. And only 18 per cent of enterprises surveyed had a female Chief Executive Officer in 2020. Timeliness and comparability of data over time and across countries, need to be improved -- Liu Zhenmin Among Fortune 500 corporate rankings, only 7.4 per cent, or 37 CEOs, were women. In political life, while women’s representation in parliaments worldwide has more than doubled globally, it has yet to cross the 25 per cent barrier of seats and although representation among cabinet ministers has quadrupled over the last 25 years, it remains at 22 per cent, well below parity. Mr. Liu called on all countries to “accelerate efforts” in empowering women and girls, towards improving data gaps in covering key gender topics. “Timeliness and comparability of data over time and across countries, need to be improved, and data disaggregation and dissemination by age, sex, location and other key variables, need to become a priority in order to fully measure and address intersecting inequalities, respond to crises, and ensure gender equality by 2030”, he upheld.
Malchin soum, Uvs aimag, 19 August 20, 2021 – World Humanitarian Day is a global celebration of people helping people. This day was designated in memory of 19 August 2003 the bomb attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, Iraq, that killed 22 humanitarian aid workers, including the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. The UN reported 475 humanitarian aid workers were attacked, 108 were killed, 242 were wounded and 125 were hijacked in 2020 alone. This year’s theme for world humanitarian day highlights the human cost of the climate crisis. On this special day, the UN Mongolia paid a tribute to the humanitarian workers who lost their precious lives in the helicopter crash during their dzud assessment mission in the Malchin soum, Uvs aimag on 14 January 2001. The UN Mongolia, together with the representatives from the National Emergency Management Agency, the local authorities and the family of B. Bayarmaa, UNFPA staff who were among the deceased, organised a memorial ceremony on the crash site in Malchin soum and celebrated the human sacrifice to the humanitarianism by the UN work in Mongolia. Mongolia is susceptible to climate-related disasters including frequent dzuds, droughts, floods, wildfires and earthquakes. In his opening remarks at the memorial ceremony, Mr. Tapan Mishra, UN Resident Coordinator, emphasised the importance of preventing any disasters if and where possible, and preparedness and swift recovery for any crisis. He called the people of Mongolia to take meaningful actions to reduce the negative impacts of the climate crisis on the most vulnerable people of the country. Ms. Ishikawa, head of the office of the UNFPA Mongolia said that in any kind of disaster, women and girls are among the most affected. UN Mongolia will collectively continue raising awareness and advocating for the health, safety, and well-being of vulnerable populations, including women and girls, affected as we did during the current pandemic and natural disasters in Mongolia. “We never want such a tragic accident again,” said Ch. Chimed, the Governor of Uvs aimag. “To not to repeat of losing precious lives of humanitarian workers who were to save lives of crisis-affected people, we must work together to ensure all necessary actions for prevention and preparedness for the climate disasters.” At the memorial ceremony, a tribute of one-minute silence paid to the victims of the disastrous helicopter crash that took the lives of the Mongolian joint humanitarian assessment team including: Ms. Speciose Hakizimana, Deputy Representative of UNICEF Mongolia, has participated in the commemoration to pay tribute to the memory of Mr. Matthew Girvin, UNICEF-Mongolia, said that we, as UN personnel, get inspired by their humane sacrifice of our colleagues to build better tomorrow for those whom we serve.
The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and UNICEF is launching the Situation Analysis of Children and Adolescents with Disabilities in Kyrgyzstan to support the country’s efforts to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The launch will be held online and offline for representatives of the government and development partners, civil society organizations working with children with disabilities, children with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, and the private sector. The analysis identified barriers to providing quality and inclusive services for children and adolescents with disabilities and challenges at the policymaking and implementation level. The report includes evidence and recommendations to the Government, development partners, and civil society to develop appropriate policies, focusing on capacity building and inclusive service delivery. “The contributions of children with disabilities and their families to the study are testament to families and children’s tenacity, and parents unconditional love for their children, despite barriers they face. The study points us to critical action that need to be taken, so children with disabilities can realize their potential as active members of society,” stated Christine Jaulmes at the launch of the report. The researchers recommend investing in further developing an Early Identification and Early Intervention mechanism, strengthening inclusive education and the de-institutionalization of children with disabilities from residential institutions. Social norms and harmful practices in treating children with disabilities should be addressed to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are met through a system-wide approach to disability and inclusion. The Situation Analysis provides evidence and guidance for future policy formulation and service provision to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. It also informs civil society organizations and international development partners to focus their efforts on supporting the Government in fulfilling the rights of children and adolescents with disabilities.
A new technical cooperation project on making agriculture more resilient to climate change is about to start in Armenia with a project document signed by FAO and the Ministry of Economy of Armenia. The two-year project covers Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and North Macedonia. All four countries are facing problems of adaptation and development of independent, diversified agricultural structures. One limiting factor is that the majority of seeds, and other input materials, come from outside, thus, farmers depend on imported seeds. They cannot yet fully benefit from the advantages of quality seeds due to a combination of factors, including hampered seed production, distribution, and quality assurance systems, as well as bottlenecks caused by a lack of good seed policy on key issues. “Armenia, similarly to Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, and Tajikistan, is facing similar risks due to climate change, and the agricultural production of the country strongly depends on irrigation, weather conditions, proper genetic resources, soil and water management,” said Tania Santivanez, FAO agricultural officer. To address the main problems as described above, the project in Armenia foresees improvements in planting material and seed certification system; laboratory testing for quality control; developing and adapting methodologies for testing new varieties. Agriculture in Armenia, especially the seed sector, is facing several challenges. The project addresses the most urgent ones, including the lack of national breeds resulting in the dependence on seed import, well-established and trustworthy seed and planting material certification scheme, access and knowledge of high quality and climate tolerant seeds and planting material for farmers, and low awareness on the importance of the management of plant genetic resources. Farmers often use their own seeds, which carry risks of uncertain production outcomes and disease vulnerabilities. These issues contribute to the increase of the vulnerability of the country’s agriculture to the climate change. “Moreover, in the context of the COVID-19 era, implementation of the project is very relevant due to the project will support strengthening the national seed system as one of the main pillars of crop production and food security”, added Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative to Armenia. This project is in line with the Government’s recently approved strategy for sustainable agricultural development in Armenia; improving seed and planting material certification system is one of the prioritized actions there. The interventions will be integrated into the ongoing development actions to ensure the sustainability of the process beyond the project duration. They are tailored to the needs of the government, to build the capacity of government officials at the national and regional levels. These interventions are also in line with the current government policies and strategies.
BISHKEK – The COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious threats to food security and nutrition of the poorest people in the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly those living in urban areas, according to a new study released by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) together with National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic (NSC). Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition Analysis in the context of COVID-19 and the role of Social Protection in the Kyrgyz Republic draws upon data from across the country gathered before and after the pandemic struck. The comparisons show that drops in income have not only reduced demand for food, but also induced shifts in the mix of products consumed, with families eating less nutrient-rich foods, like fruits, vegetables, and animal-sourced foods, and more calorie rich-foods, like bread and sugar. A profound economic crisis caused by the pandemic has resulted in an increase in newly poor and unemployed people in the Kyrgys Republic. In order to cope, families reported applying different coping strategies that have impacted negatively on their nutrition, health and productivity, and will be difficult to reverse in the future, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and vulnerability. In addition to ’stress’ coping strategies (e.g. borrowing money to meet food needs), more households had to apply ‘crisis’ and ‘emergency’ type strategies, such as selling assets, reducing spending on essential non-food items, selling property, and asking for humanitarian assistance. The number of households resorting to these coping strategies increased from 12 percent in 2020 to 36 percent in 2021. This translates into a reduced ability to deal with future shocks, reduction of current and future productivity, and the jeopardizing of future livelihoods. “This important analysis demonstrates the alarming effects of the pandemic on the population’s food and nutrition security, and how food insecurity and malnutrition are closely linked to poverty,” said Michael Huggins, WFP Kyrgyz Republic Officer-in-Charge. “Critical measures need to be taken now to strengthen the government’s approach to social protection to help the families, and the country, fully recover from the socio-economic fallout of COVID-19.” Some of the recommendations include focusing on income-generating activities and poverty graduation programmes to build people’s resilience; fostering inter-sectoral linkages between social protection and food systems; promoting healthy and diverse diets among the population; and strengthening the design of social benefits to make sure that “no one is left behind.” The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. We are the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

The campaign showcases a multi-faceted response by the entire UN system in the country. Being an integral part of the Egyptian social fabric, the UN agencies and entities in Egypt continue to do their work in support of the government’s efforts in response to the COVID-19 situation that made it imperative to change their tactics, including working remotely. Reflecting their continuing commitment and responsibility, the UN in Egypt has launched a social media campaign to highlight the coordinated, critical work being done around the clock by different UN entities towards a more efficient response to COVID-19. The campaign showcases a multi-faceted response by the entire UN system in the country. That includes efforts to enhance the healthcare and social protection systems, ensuring the continued learning for all children in light of the closure of schools, making sure that refugees, asylum-seekers and other vulnerable communities are taken into account in national response plans. Furthermore, given the growing concerns that women will be severely affected by crisis, the campaign underscores the UN system in Egypt’s efforts towards ensuring that gender perspective is properly addressed in the country’s COVID-19 response plans. Echoing the United Nations Secretary-General’s call to support the World Health Organization (WHO) which has been leading the multilateral response since the beginning of the crisis, UN agencies in Egypt are also using their digital platforms to amplify messages by the UN health agency, and counter widespread misinformation around coronavirus.
The UN Resident Coordinator briefed the National SDG Coordinator about the work of the UN System agencies in 2020, focusing on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Resident Coordinator informed the SDG Coordinator about the new COVID-19 Social and Economic Response Plan for Belarus prepared by the UN agencies under the leadership of UNDP and UNICEF. The Resident Coordinator also informed the National SDG Coordinator about resource mobilization efforts and discussions with key donors, including the EU, about funding for COVID-19 related work in communities. The Resident Coordinator underscored the indispensable role of partnerships in work on the SDGs and conveyed to the National SDG Coordinator the concerns of members of the Partnership Group of the SDG Council about undue pressure on civil society organizations in recent months. Civil society organizations working in the areas of the environment, women’s rights and children’s rights and those providing support to the elderly or people with disabilities represent an important sector of professional partners who are leading innovation and piloting solutions for SDG acceleration, the Resident Coordinator said. The United Nations acknowledges the important voice of civil society in the spirit of the SDGs and the principles of partnership and ‘leaving no one behind’. The Resident Coordinator and the National SDG Coordinator agreed that the SDGs should not be politicized. The Resident Coordinator added that human rights which underpin the SDG agenda should not be politicized either. Development without respect for human rights cannot be truly sustainable. The UN Resident Coordinator referred also to the national strategic plans and programmes, many of which are being prepared by sectoral ministries and recalled that the UN agencies and experts offered a range of comments and concrete recommendations to the National Strategy 2035, the National Programme on Gender and the National Programme on the Health of the Nation and Demographic Security. In view of Belarus’s global commitments to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the UN is ready to contribute to designing a truly cross-sectoral and inclusive Green Economy action plan. The Resident Coordinator and the National SDG Coordinator also discussed cooperation in popularizing knowledge about SDGs and localizing SDGs as well as implementing innovative sustainable development strategies regionally. They also exchanged views on the importance of joint projects, attracting donor resources and registration of technical assistance. The UN Resident Coordinator noted that less complicated and faster official registration for technical assistance would make it easier to attract donor funding and ensure programmes are relevant, effective and timely. The Resident Coordinator and the National SDG Coordinator agreed to continue their constructive dialogue and support for SDG projects and to meet again soon.
Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) has handed over personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic within the framework of the fight against COVID-19 infectious disease in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. Personal protective equipment is being provided under the WHO pipeline. PPE shipment includes 950 protective overalls; 100 infrared thermometers; 950 of disposable gloves; 950 goggles; 950 type FFP 2 face masks. The total cost of humanitarian aid comprises more than 22, 000 USD. This personal protective equipment will enable healthcare providers and primary care providers across the country to promptly and safely fight COVID-19 in the country. These items are supplied upon the request of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to combat COVID-19. The Sanitary and Epidemiological Service of the Kyrgyz Republic plans to distribute half of the PPEs to health care facilities in the south of the country. In addition, at the request of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic 2 procurements were completed and supply of laboratory consumables for sample collection and testing was organized (tubes, swabs, kits, reagents, etc.), amounting to about 36,000 USD. WHO continuously provides updated evidence-based data, recommendations, guidelines on COVID-19 Prevention, Laboratory Diagnosis and Treatment to the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Health and health workers on a regular basis. WHO has also handed over the printed communication materials on COVID-19 risks to the KR MOH, which were distributed to the general public across the country. These materials were jointly adapted by the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic. In mid-March, WHO in close collaboration with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) had provided the Kyrgyz Republic with protective protection equipment: 10 000 surgical masks; 10 000 gloves; 1400 protective overalls; 200 goggles and 200 FFP2 type face masks. The shipment was sent from the WHO Regional Logistics Center in Dubai. Information: this assistance is provided as part of the joint humanitarian response under the Disaster Response Coordination Unit, which was activated on 16 March 2020 following the request of the Government to assist her in emergency preparedness and response for COVID-19 and setting a stage for early recovery. Chaired by the UN Resident Coordinator, the DRCU prioritizes and channels its support under six priority sectors: early recovery, education, food security and logistics, health, protection, and joint sector for water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and non-food items (NFI). The DRCU was set up in 2008 and its inter-agency teams comprise representatives of government ministries, UN agencies, international and local NGOs and representatives of donor community.
Today, we remember and pay tribute to all victims and survivors of terrorism. We stand in solidarity with those whose loved ones have been killed, those who… Today, we remember and pay tribute to all victims and survivors of terrorism. We stand in solidarity with those whose loved ones have been killed, those who still suffer from physical and psychological harm, and those communities and societies that have been permanently scarred by terrorist acts. We support survivors by listening to and amplifying their voices, upholding their rights and providing the support, justice and dignity to which they are entitled. This year’s observance focuses on the importance of connections, especially during the ongoing pandemic, which continues to restrict movements, limit peoples’ ability to see loved ones and, for victims and survivors, denies them the opportunity to come together to support each other. Connection can be a powerful agent of healing, helping terrorism survivors around the world to feel heard, seen and less alone. Connections between survivors, victims’ associations, civil society and Member States are also crucial in helping better uphold the rights and support the needs of victims now and in the future. I look forward to seeing how we can further these efforts during the first ever United Nations Global Congress of Victims of Terrorism to be held later this year. The United Nations is committed to a world free from terrorism. On this International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, and on all days, let us stand in solidarity with all victims and survivors so we may support them in healing their trauma and bring them hope.
Today, Ethiopia joins the rest of the world in commemorating the Menstrual Hygiene Day under the theme, “Periods in Pandemic – it is time to take action!” The objective this year is to emphasize the importance of continuing menstrual hygiene awareness and support for women and girls during COVID-19, especially for those living in poverty, the internally displaced, refugees, and those in quarantine and transit centers. A pandemic such as COVID-19 doesn’t stop activities to support the basic menstrual hygiene needs of women and girls, including those who are on the frontlines of the pandemic. It is imperative that girls and women living in poverty, the internally displaced, refugees, and those in quarantine and transit centers are provided with menstrual hygiene kits. This is part of preserving their dignity amidst the difficult conditions they are living in. “Given the multiple challenges that women and adolescent girls face, it is evident that promoting menstrual hygiene management is not only a health and sanitation matter, it is also a crucial step towards safeguarding the dignity, integrity and overall life opportunities for women and girls,” says Minister of Health Dr. Lia Tadesse. Since 2016, the Federal Ministry of Health, together with government and civil society partners, has been implementing a comprehensive menstrual hygiene and health programme in the country. The programme includes raising awareness in schools and surrounding communities to reduce stigma around menstruation, providing appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, increasing access to sanitary products, and making available safe spaces in schools to reduce absenteeism for girls during menstruation. Following the award of the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year to Freweini Mebrahtu for her work on reducing the cultural stigma attached to menstruation in parts of rural Ethiopia, a Menstrual Hygiene and Health taskforce was formed under the leadership of Her Excellency the President Sahle-Work Zewde to spearhead the menstrual hygiene programme. While many people still doubt the seriousness of the issue, for countless girls and women, sanitary pads are an unaffordable ‘luxury’. Among the thousands of girls with whom UNICEF has worked, most explained that they were forced to resort to unsanitary and sometimes unsafe methods to meet their needs. A 2020 UNICEF survey shows that 18 per cent of young girls miss school during menstruation. Nearly half cited pain as the reason and a quarter cited fear of leaking. The report also shows that girls have difficulties talking to their teachers about menstruation challenges at school. Cultural taboos that forbid girls from certain activities when menstruating – such as fetching water, engaging in religious activities, cooking – need to be addressed. “UNICEF is working with the government and other partners to ensure that women and girls are not disadvantaged by something as natural as their periods,” says UNICEF Representative Adele Khodr. “We are advocating with partners in the OneWASH national programme to mainstream menstrual hygiene, particularly in schools and health centers.” UNICEF has supported the Ministry of Health to establish national standards for reusable and disposable pads and inclusion of menstrual hygiene and health in the health extension programme. Menstrual hygiene and disability are now included in the design and construction of water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities in schools and health centers. With funding from the governments of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada, awareness campaigns have reached 106,500 school children and 13 million people. The Government and UNICEF are calling for an end to stigma and shame and for more support for vulnerable women and girls in the form of menstrual pads, especially during COVID-19. This is our duty to ensure the dignity of those caught up in difficult conditions. Menstrual Hygiene Day is a global platform bringing together non-profits, government agencies, the private sector, the media and individuals to promote Menstrual Hygiene Management. Menstrual Hygiene Day raises awareness of the challenges women and girls worldwide face due to their menstruation and highlights solutions that address these challenges, including through media work. It catalyses a growing, global movement for Menstrual Hygiene Management and supports partnerships at global, regional, national and local level. Menstrual Hygiene Day also creates opportunities to advocate for the integration of Menstrual Hygiene Day in global, national and local policies, programmes and projects.

Baghdad: After 3 years of fruitful collaboration between UN-Habitat Iraq and the Ministry of Justice of Iraq, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with the support of the Prime Minister of Iraq, and under the patronage of Mr. Salar Abdul Sattar Muhammad, Minister of Justice. The MOU aims to strengthen the cooperation between UN-Habitat and Ministry of Justice through joint efforts to secure and protect land tenure rights, and to facilitate the registration of ownership rights as one of the most critical durable solutions for Yazidis in Sinjar district. Additionally, the MOU strives to seek and explore potential solutions and legal approaches with respect to ownership rights and documentation, and remedy the effects resulting from the destruction of documents in the city of Mosul. Yazidis in Sinjar area face major challenges in proving their ownership or occupancy land rights, particularly where official documents are missing, damaged, destroyed, or in the absence of cadastral and registry information and maps delineating land and property to prove ownership or occupancy rights. Addressing and resolving Yazidi land rights would mark a major step towards respecting human rights and reconciliation. UN-Habitat has been addressing land rights of Yazidi minorities in Sinjar area since 2016, immediately after the area was liberated from ISIL. The agency is implementing a programme titled “Support to Housing, Land and Property Rights for IDPs in Nineveh” which aims to facilitate the sustainable return and focuses on vulnerable IDPs from minorities (Yazidis) whose access to Housing, Land and Property (HLP) rights has been denied for decades by a legacy of discriminatory policies and practices against Yazidis, as well as by recent violent conflict. UN-Habitat is registering and mapping land claims by Yazidi returnees, supporting the verification of their claim among themselves, and issuing “Occupancy Certificates” that are endorsed by local authorities and community representatives. The issuance of occupancy certificates by UN-Habitat is a first step toward the final registration of Yazidis land rights in Iraq. More than 7,600 Occupancy Certificates have been distributed to Yazidis returnees so far, recognizing their occupancy rights for the first time in modern history. UN-Habitat is also liaising closely with the Prime Minister’s Office and the Iraqi Ministry of Justice to endorse a legal decree to formalize the recognition of land rights and upgrade the occupancy certificates to full “Land Ownership Titles”. Mr. Ahmed Luebi, Director General of the Department for Justice Affairs in the Ministry of Justice, stated that the signing of the MOU with UN-Habitat is necessary to ensure the sustainable return of the displaced people and the right of Yazidis to own land in Sinjar, which is considered one of the most important areas in Iraq. Further, he outlined that the MOU was drafted with the support of Prime Minister and the efforts of the Minister of Justice, Judge Salar Abdul Sattar Muhammed. Wael Al-Ashhab, Head of UN-Habitat Iraq, emphasized that the signing of MOU is as result of great collaboration with Ministry of Justice which is our main counterpart in our journey to facilitate the registration of Yazidis land rights. UN-Habitat will continue to support MOJ to finalize the registration of Yazidis land rights and additional support will be provided to Real Estate Registration Office in Mosul by building capacity on housing, land and property related issues. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
The event is a part of a joint Action Plan between UN and the Interdepartmental Commission on the implementation of international human rights obligations. “The promotion and protection of human rights is also reflected as an integral component of the new Cooperation framework for 2021-2025 and in the Socio-economic response plan in Turkmenistan to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic in the country”, noted Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan. The members of the of Interdepartmental commission as well as representatives of Office of Ombudsmen, UN Agencies reviewed the national mechanisms on development of reports and key functions of tracking database in the area of human rights presented by OHCHR Human Rights Advisors. They have also learnt the international experience in developing the database and its effectiveness. The development of online database will contribute to the digitalization of monitoring and reporting processes and contribute to the monitoring of the implementation of existing action plans in the field of human rights, the Action Plan for Gender Equality, the Action Plan for the Realization of the Rights of the Child and others, and will also contribute to the implementation of the state Digital Economy concept.
13 July 2021 – After a decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths across WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region for 8 consecutive weeks, several countries are seeing a significant increase in new cases and deaths. Significant increases in COVID-19 cases have been reported from Libya, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Tunisia. Lebanon and Morocco have also started to see a rise in cases, with an exponential increase expected in these 2 countries in the coming weeks. “We are reaching a critical point for COVID-19 in our Region,” said Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. “Just one week after reaching the grim milestone of 11 million cases, we are now seeing an upward spike in a number of countries. This is being aggravated by new variants circulating – most concerningly the Delta variant – low vaccine availability and uptake, and lack of adherence to public health and social measures.” With the Eid al-Adha feast taking place during the week starting 20 July, traditionally marked by religious and social gatherings, WHO is concerned that the current upsurge may continue to peak in the coming weeks, with catastrophic consequences. “Countries are reintroducing or strengthening social and travel restrictions, but at this stage, increasing complacency by communities means that the virus is winning in the Region. “As variants continue to spread, we need everyone to get vaccinated as soon as they are offered the vaccine, and to continue wearing masks, and practising physical distancing. Although significant progress has been made, there remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines, and this leaves millions of people exposed to deadly variants of concern. It is not too late to turn the course of this pandemic, but it requires much more exerted global, regional and national efforts,” said Dr Al-Mandhari. The total number of cases across the Region now exceeds 11.4 million, and the number of deaths is more than 223 000, with 19 out of 22 countries now reporting at least one new variant circulating. Tunisia reports the highest COVID-19 mortality rate of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and the African continent. The situation in the country continues to be extremely concerning. Between 8000 and 9500 cases are currently being reported every day, with wide circulation of the Delta variant. In less than one week, the number of deaths almost doubled, from 119 deaths on 5 July to 189 deaths on 8 July. Vaccine coverage is increasing, especially among people older than 60, but coverage is still low, with 12.7% of the population receiving at least one dose of vaccine, and 6% fully vaccinated. Public health measures have been strengthened, including suspension of social events and closures of businesses. Full lockdown is being implemented in some governorates, but the impact of these measures on the circulation of the virus and daily incidence needs to be strictly monitored. Oxygen beds are at 90% occupancy and intensive care unit beds are at 95% occupancy. In some governorates, hospital beds are over capacity. Hospitals are overwhelmed with limited numbers of available beds, and risk of shortage of oxygen supply. They also suffer from limited human resources, with medical staff very dedicated, but exhausted. Support to Tunisia has been remarkable, with countries in the Region and beyond stepping up to deliver field hospitals, medical equipment and oxygen cylinders, and additional vaccines, highlighting the spirit of solidarity and action within the Regional 2023 Vision of Health for All by All. WHO, like other international partners, is committed to supporting Tunisia in facing this crisis, including by procuring additional oxygen concentrators and generators to hospitals, as well as medical supplies, tests, reagents and PPE, and supporting provision of additional vaccines. Through the Emergency Medical Teams Initiative, WHO is also reaching out to its network partners for the possible deployment of international emergency medical teams to provide surge support in the areas of intensive and critical care, infection control and infectious diseases. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the number of cases has been increasing since mid-June. The daily average almost doubled during the past 4 weeks, increasing from 8539 on week of 6 June to 16 393 on week of 4 July. After 8 weeks of continuous decline, the number of deaths also increased during the past 2 weeks. Officials have blamed the surge on mass gatherings and travel during Nowruz, the country’s biggest holiday which took place in late March, saying that compliance with health measures like social distancing and mask-wearing noticeably plummeted over the holiday. In Iraq, cases have been increasing since the end of May with the daily average doubling during the past 5 weeks, increasing from 4010 cases on week of 30 May to 8076 cases on week of 4 July. The number of deaths has also increased during the past 3 weeks. Less than one percent of the population received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Efforts by Iraq to contain the pandemic include banning government employees, students, and teachers from working unless they bring a vaccination document or a negative PCR test report on a weekly basis, and a countrywide partial curfew is being implemented. In Libya, a dramatic upsurge in cases starting on week of 4 July. The daily average of cases increased by 425%, from 246 cases on week of 20 June to 1293 cases on week of 4 July. Alfa and Beta variants of concern have been officially confirmed in the country, and the Delta variant is suspected to be circulating, given its presence in neighbouring countries. As a result, borders with Tunisia have been closed for one week. Vaccination coverage is still at a low level, with only 5.6% of the population partially vaccinated. Cases in Morocco have been steadily increasing since mid-May, with the daily average increasing from 170 cases on week of 9 May to 1066 cases on week of 4 July. Alpha and Delta variants of concern have been detected, causing Morocco’s government to announce an extension of the state of emergency until 10 August. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
At the Last United Nations General Assembly in September 2020, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic together with other world leaders reconfirmed the need for fundamental socio-economic transformation in order to reach the sustainable future outlined in the 2030 Agenda. The window for action is the next decade which we entered this year, and which was recognized by the UN General Assembly as “decisive decade for People and the Planet”. The United Nations in the Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the efforts of the Government of Kyrgyz Republic, civil society, academia, media, private sector and other stakeholders on promoting equality, preventing violence against women, and fostering the participation of women in public life and honoring the State’s commitments to women and girls of Kyrgyzstan. The 2030 Agenda reaffirms that gender equality is an essential foundation for sustainable development in any country. Therefore the national development of the Kyrgyz Republic is directly related to how much Kyrgyzstani women are able to participate and to hold leadership positions in the society and economy. A gender-responsive path towards the SDGs in Kyrgyzstan largely depends on how the State will be able to accelerate its actions to fulfill existing and new commitments to gender equality and women’s human rights. This year, the theme for International Women’s Day, “Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world,” celebrates the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the gaps that remain. Women’s full and effective participation and leadership in all areas of life drives progress for everyone. The role of women in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kyrgyzstan has proven the same. Yet, women are still underrepresented in public life and decision-making. In addition to persisting social and systemic barriers to women's participation and leadership, the COVID-19 pandemic has created new barriers. Women face an increase in domestic violence, unpaid care responsibilities, unemployment and poverty, and women from some groups are affected more than the others. Although women make up the majority of frontline workers, there is a disproportionate and inadequate representation of women in national policy-making processes related to COVID-19. Approaching International Women’s Day serves as another reminder that the State has to accelerate its efforts to protect and promote women’s rights, dignity and leadership by creating an enabling policy, legal, institutional and other conditions for women to realize their rights. The Kyrgyz Republic should not lose the gains it has made over the past decades on women’s rights and empowerment, but should continue to push for wholesale, rapid and sustainable change. An important element for the protection human rights and empowerment of women is to ensure the proper realization of the fundamental freedoms, including the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. World leaders are uniting under the “Generation Equality Forum” appeals and signing up to the Political Engagement Strategy on ending violence against women in response to the appeal of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres. We therefore call on the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and all political and civic leaders to affirm their commitment to the appeal by Mr. Guterres, and through demonstrable action to enhance the role and participation of women in all forms of decision making in the society and the economy. On the occasion of International Women’s Day of 2021, let us all amplify and support women and girls in all spheres of life in Kyrgyzstan who are breaking down barriers and championing to create a better world for everyone. Let us all unite and bring about the real change in the lives of women and girls, working hand in hand together with them through their equal participation and voice. Let everyone commit to working towards a prosperous and bright future of Kyrgyzstan that includes all the women and girls.
For the past seven decades, the cells of Henrietta Lacks, a Black American woman who died of cervical cancer, have saved countless lives,… For the past seven decades, the cells of Henrietta Lacks, a Black American woman who died of cervical cancer, have saved countless lives, and made numerous scientific breakthroughs possible, such as the human papillomavirus and polio vaccines, drugs for HIV treatment, together with cancer and COVID-19 research. This Wednesday, the UN World Health Organization’s (WHO) Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recognized her world-changing legacy with a special award. In 1951, while Ms. Lacks sought treatment, researchers took biopsies from her body without her knowledge or consent, and her cells became the first “immortal” cell line, now known as the “HeLa cells”. Shockingly, as WHO points out, the global scientific community once hid her race and her real story, a historical wrong that Wednesday’s recognition hopes to help redress. For Tedros, in honouring Mrs. Lacks, the UN agency “acknowledges the importance of reckoning with past scientific injustices and advancing racial equity in health and science.” He said the award was also “an opportunity to recognize women, particularly women of colour, who have made incredible but often unseen contributions to medical science.” The award was received at the WHO office in Geneva by Lawrence Lacks, Ms. Lacks’ 87-year-old son. He is one of the last living relatives who personally knew her. Mr. Lacks was accompanied by several of Henrietta Lacks’ grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and other family members. Mr. Lacks said the family was moved to receive this historic recognition, honouring “a remarkable woman and the lasting impact of her HeLa cells.” “My mother’s contributions, once hidden, are now being rightfully honoured for their global impact,” he said. “My mother was a pioneer in life, giving back to her community, helping others live a better life and caring for others. In death she continues to help the world. Her legacy lives on in us and we thank you for saying her name – Henrietta Lacks.” According to WHO, women of colour continue to be disproportionately affected by cervical cancer. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exposed the many health inequities that persist among marginalized communities around the world. Studies in various countries consistently document that Black women are dying of cervical cancer at several times the rate of white women. Today, 19 of the 20 countries with the highest cervical cancer burdens are in Africa. The past year, which saw the 100th anniversary of Henrietta Lacks’ birth, also coincided with the launch of WHO’s Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer, an initiative Mrs. Lacks’ family has endorsed. Her relatives have also joined WHO in advocating for equity in access to the HPV vaccine, which protects against a range of cancers, including cervical cancer. Despite having been prequalified by WHO over 12 years ago, supply constraints and high prices still prevent adequate doses from reaching girls in low and middle-income countries. As of 2020, less than 25% of low-income countries and less than 30% of lower middle-income countries had access to the HPV vaccine through their national immunization programmes, compared with more than 85% of high-income countries. For the Assistant Director-General for Strategic Priorites and Special Advisor to the Director General, Princess Nothemba Simelela, “it is unacceptable that access to the lifesaving HPV vaccine can be shaped by your race, ethnicity or where you happen to be born.” Reminding that the HPV vaccine was developed using Henrietta Lacks’ cells, she added: “We owe it to her and her family to achieve equitable access to this groundbreaking vaccine.” As a young mother, Henrietta Lacks and her husband were raising five children near Baltimore when she fell ill. She went to Johns Hopkins medical centre in the city, one of the few leading hospitals at the time which served African-Americans, after experiencing extensive vaginal bleeding and was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Despite treatment, she died on October 4, 1951, at only 31 years old. During treatment, researchers took samples of her tumour. That “HeLa” cell line was a scientific breakthrough: the first immortal line of human cells to divide indefinitely, under laboratory conditions, to power research. The cells were mass produced, for profit, without recognition to her family. Over 50,000,000 metric tonnes of HeLa cells have been distributed around the world – forming part of over 75,000 studies. In addition to the HPV and polio vaccines, they allowed for development of drugs for HIV/AIDS, haemophilia, leukaemia, and Parkinson’s disease; breakthroughs in reproductive health, including in vitro fertilization; research on chromosomal conditions, cancer, gene mapping, and precision medicine. Currently, they are being used in studies responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the presentation of the award, the family and WHO proceeded to the shores of Lake Geneva, to watch the city’s iconic Jet d’Eau illuminate in the colour teal, the colour which marks cervical cancer awareness. It is the first of several world monuments that will illuminate in teal between now and November 17th, marking the first anniversary of the launch of the global elimination campaign.
The new guidelines recommend at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week for all adults, including people living with chronic conditions or disability, and an average of 60 minutes per day for children and adolescents. WHO statistics show that one in four adults, and four out of five adolescents, do not get enough physical activity. Globally this is estimated to cost US$54 billion in direct health care and another US$14 billion to lost productivity. The guidelines encourage women to maintain regular physical activity throughout pregnancy and post-delivery. They also highlight the valuable health benefits of physical activity for people living with disabilities. Older adults (aged 65 years or older) are advised to add activities which emphasize balance and coordination, as well as muscle strengthening, to help prevent falls and improve health. Regular physical activity is key to preventing and helping to manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer, as well as reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, reducing cognitive decline, improving memory and boosting brain health. “Being physically active is critical for health and well-being – it can help to add years to life and life to years,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Every move counts, especially now as we manage the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must all move every day – safely and creatively.” All physical activity is beneficial and can be done as part of work, sport and leisure or transport (walking, wheeling and cycling), but also through dance, play and everyday household tasks, like gardening and cleaning. “Physical activity of any type, and any duration can improve health and wellbeing, but more is always better,” said Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of Health Promotion, World Health Organization, “and if you must spend a lot of time sitting still, whether at work or school, you should do more physical activity to counter the harmful effects of sedentary behaviour.” “These new guidelines highlight how important being active is for our hearts, bodies and minds, and how the favourable outcomes benefit everyone, of all ages and abilities”, said Dr Fiona Bull, Head of the Physical Activity Unit which led the development of the new WHO guidelines. WHO encourages countries to adopt the global guidelines to develop national health policies in support of the WHO Global action plan on physical activity 2018-2030. The plan was agreed by global health leaders at the 71st World Health Assembly in 2018 to reduce physical inactivity by 15% by 2030.
The project aims to minimize the COVID-19 pandemic's negative impact on people’s health through quality telehealth and telemedicine services. A new joint project on digital health: Minimizing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Georgia through telemedicine and digital health solutions was launched today at Mukhrovani Ambulatory. This three-year project is funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by four UN agencies (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOPS), working in close cooperation with the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia. Under this new EU-UN initiative, 200 rural facilities will receive basic equipment and another 50 will receive telemedicine equipment to support the safe management of COVID-19. At the same time the new equipment will be used to ensure uninterrupted access to health care for persons with chronic conditions and provision of routine health services for children. Health care providers will also be invited to participate in online training to improve and expand their capacity to provide quality primary health care (PHC) services. Carl Hartzell, Ambassador of the European Union to Georgia stated, “Helping the people of Georgia to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic has been a key priority for the European Union from the very first day. With this innovative project that we are launching together with our UN partners, we hope to reach even more citizens throughout Georgia with healthcare services. Proper access to healthcare should be for everyone, and we hope to contribute to this goal.” “COVID-19 once again showed us the importance of a strong primary health care system; effective utilization of existing resources has enabled us to manage home care for a large number of infected patients,” said Ekaterine Tikaradze, Minister of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia. “Introducing telemedicine in primary health care clinics in the regions will significantly improve the system, bringing positive results to both the population and to doctors. The capacity of village doctors will improve, as they will be provided with the newest diagnostic technologies. This has been made possible through our loyal partners, for which I am sincerely grateful.” "Development through digital transformation is part of building forward better globally as well as in all regions of Georgia,“ said Sabine Machl, UN Resident Coordinator. “Through this joint telemedicine project four UN agencies together with the EU support Georgia with digital health solutions.” “Apart from supporting the immediate response to COVID-19 at the PHC level, this project is going to build a solid and sustainable foundation for digital health and telemedicine in Georgia, by supporting the development of the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks, clinical guidelines, provision of specific trainings for PHC personnel and promoting the use of telemedicine services among health care providers and the population,” said Silviu Domente, WHO Representative and Head of Country Office in Georgia. Digital solutions for health protect and promote health and well-being, improve access to essential health services and reduce the burden on the health care system during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. In the immediate-term this project will contribute to reducing the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the health of the population and health care system in Georgia and increase access to health care regardless of location. In the long-term, EU and UN support under this project will help build a more resilient primary health care system with telemedicine capacities in Georgia and increase equitable access to health care services regardless of location and contribute to progress towards universal health coverage (UHC). The project, “Minimizing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Georgia through telemedicine and digital health solutions,” aims to harness the potential of digital tools for advancing telehealth services and promoting health in Georgia. This assistance is an integral part of the EU’s and UN’s support to the COVID-19 response in the country, as well as ongoing WHO technical assistance under the UHC-Partnership to support the commitment of national authorities to primary health care reform and the advancement of UHC in Georgia. The project will be implemented by four UN partners (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOPS) under WHO leadership, bringing their respective areas of expertise and added-value to contribute to the overall action’s objective to minimize the COVID-19 pandemic's negative impact on people’s health and the health system through quality telehealth and telemedicine services and to build back better by supporting a sustainable and resilient recovery in Georgia after the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance is part of a wider support package provided by the EU and Team Europe consisting of GEL 1.5 billion of new and reallocated assistance to help Georgia address the COVID-19 pandemic, including support to vulnerable groups and economic recovery. That is one of the highest levels of EU assistance per capita to any country in the world and demonstrates the EU’s strong solidarity with Georgia at this time of unprecedented crisis.
- Geographic Indication products as the path forward towards sustainable agriculture In line with FAO’s mandate to reduce rural poverty through cross-sectorial policy advice and capacity development for the definition of sustainable rural development and poverty reduction strategies, work has continued on the identification of local products with the potential to become quality products with Geographic Indications (GI). Technical assistance has been provided to three producer groups in Malesi e Madhe, Puke, Shtebleve and Gjinar in the registration process and the development of Code of Conduct. Relying on the inventory of products with a potential to become GI’s, named “The Ark of Taste”, two products are in the process to be registered with the General Directorate of Industrial Property.
Preterm Birth Complications is One of the Main Causes for Under Five Child Mortality in Pakistan UNICEF is supporting Govt of Pakistan to expand Kangaroo Mother Care facilities to save children born prematurely Islamabad - 16 November 2021: The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) calls for accelerated efforts to save precious lives of children born prematurely as World Prematurity Day (WCD) is commemorated on November 17, 2021. The theme this year is, Zero Separation Act now! Keep parents and babies born too soon together. In Pakistan, where preterm birth is one of the three leading causes for neonatal mortality and accounts for more than one third of all deaths in newborns, UNICEF is collaborating with the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination and provincial health departments to established Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units in health facilities across the country to save lives of children born too soon. KMC is one of the best options to provide care for babies born before time in low and middle-income countries. “Scaling up Kangaroo Mother Care in health facilities across Pakistan, is a cost-effective intervention to save preterm infants,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “Introduced in Pakistan by UNICEF a few years back, KMC has become increasingly popular with health professionals caring for children born before time. The essence of KMC is to keep parents and babies born before time, together as against the past practice of separating small and sick babies from their mothers. The physical and emotional closeness of baby and parents during birth, delivery and hospitalization has long-term health benefits for the child. Additional care during pregnancy, complete antenatal care, nutritious food, mental and psychosocial support to pregnant women and birth spacing can reduce premature births,” Ms. Girma added. In KMC, newborn is held closely to the chest by the parent, mother or father, with a blanket wrapped around both. The skin-to-skin contact provides warmth and prevents hyperthermia. It is medically beneficial for the baby and good for parent-child bonding. So far, 30 KMC units have been established in Pakistan with support from UNICEF and other development partners for round the clock service delivery. UNICEF has provided all the necessary equipment and materials to help establish 24 units in various public health centres - 16 in Punjab, 4 in Sindh, 1 in KP, 1 in AJK and 2 in Islamabad Capital Territory. It is collaborating with the Government to scale up KMC unites across the country. Government of Pakistan and its development partners are trying to reduce preterm births and newborn mortality due to related complications such as Birth Asphyxia, Prematurity and Sepsis. These efforts have helped reduce newborn mortality from 55 to 42 deaths per 1,000 live births during the last five years. It has also had a remarkable impact on morbidity in preterm newborns. The most vulnerable newborns are those born in marginalized groups, rural areas, urban slum environments and humanitarian settings. UNICEF emphasises that the reduction in premature births and newborn deaths can be achieved by strengthening health policies and services with focus on maternal nutrition and improving access and care for mothers and new-borns, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Globally, preterm birth is one of the leading causes of child deaths under age 5 as almost 15 million babies in the world are born prematurely and nearly 1 million die due to related complications. Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. Small and sick newborns, most of whom are born preterm, have the highest risk of death and contribute to the majority of the world’s disabled children. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective and basic care, e.g. warmth, breastfeeding support, basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.

The in-person trainings of social work specialists were held in all regions of the country by national trainers who completed online training of trainers provided by an international training institution. In the trainings, the social work specialists covered the aspects of social work related to child protection and social support of families, social support to people with disabilities and elderly people, social support to victims of gender-based violence, social work with parents using narcotics and alcohol, youth at risk and other vulnerable groups. The social work specialists also enhanced their professional knowledge of preventive measures and multidisciplinary approach in social work when working with different target groups, learned the best international practices in resource mobilization at community-level, as well as case management, social (re)integration of different groups in need of social support, social and biopsychosocial models of disability, developing individual support plans with social service receivers, quality standards of social services, types and symptoms of violence, understanding the nature of gender-based violence and many other important topics of social work. According to trainer Rustam Geldiyev, social work specialists made significant progress in their studies and practical work. “I can see that they not only managed to improve skills and competencies in social work, but also establish partnership relations with local authorities, who recognize and support them as new professionals in the system of social protection,” Rustam Geldiyev said. The periodic training of social work specialists is an important part of capacity building activities of the Joint Programme that aim to improve the social protection system in the country by introducing community-based social services. These trainings aim to prepare advanced generalist social workers who employ their knowledge, skills, and ethics through multidimensional understanding of communities and vulnerable groups as they engage, assess needs, intervene, and support people in their communities. The Joint Programme “Improving the system of social protection through the introduction of inclusive quality community-based social services”, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, is being implemented by the partnering UN agencies, namely, UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, and UNODC and Government of Turkmenistan. The Joint Programme aims to introduce a new model of social services at the community level accompanied by relative legislative reviews and capacity building of national social service workforce. The lead national partner is the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population of Turkmenistan and the lead UN agency is UNICEF. Other key national partners include the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Industry, and Ministry of Finance and Economy.
26 December 2022; Baghdad, Iraq - The Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Governorate of Anbar and UNFPA re-opened the Ramadi Youth Safe Space on 25 December. The Youth Safe Space serves as a place for girls and boys to receive life and leadership skills, peacebuilding and edutainment activities. Originally this building was a House of Youth under the Ministry of Youth and Sports management. It was a special place for young people of Anbar and the community to build friendships and learn new skills in music, arts, science. Back in 2014, the place was used as a prison by the Islamic States in Iraq and Levant (ISIL) during the war. The building was severely damaged. After the liberation of the territories, young people in Anbar decided to bring the building back to its original purpose and make it a youth-friendly place. In 2018, UNFPA helped the youth rehabilitate two rooms for peace-building activities. As the demand for youth services grew among communities and youth, UNFPA with support from Canada, the Governor of Anbar and UIMS, completed the rehabilitation of the Youth Safe Space. Young volunteers were the ones who led the process and made decisions about how to make the place more accessible for all young people in the surrounding communities, including the most vulnerable. Once a space that reminded people of sorrow and pain, today is a place of hope and strength. Speaking at the event, the Governor of Anbar, Mr Ali Farhan Al-Dulaimi, thanked UNFPA for the continuous support and investment in the young people in Anbar. Dr Rita Columbia, UNFPA Representative in Iraq, highlighted the importance of empowering young people and engaging them in community life. She said: “I am very proud of the young volunteers who had a dream and made it a reality. Thanks to their determination and the support they received from UNFPA, Canada, the Anbar Directorate of Youth and Sports, the Governor of Anbar, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, this centre became a welcoming and truly youth-friendly space.” The opening ceremony was attended by the Anbar Governor, the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Iraq, Salem Al-Zamanan, representatives of the Ministry of Youth & Sport, the Anbar Directorate of Youth and Sports, the UNFPA Representative, and representatives of the civil society and young people. UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, delivers a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe, and every young person’s potential is fulfilled. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
On 20 June World Refugee Day UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, encourages further efforts of the Kyrgyz Republic to include refugees in health systems, education and sport and through this to support their integration into the local communities. As of the end of 2020 the Kyrgyz Republic hosted 684 refugees and asylum seekers. Many but not all of them yet have access to medical care, including COVID-19 vaccination, education and work. UNHCR will continue supporting authorities and other partners to achieve a better inclusion of all refugees in healthcare, education, employment and social protection to enable them to fully contribute to the development of their host communities. “In 2021, we mark World Refugee Day amid a continuing pandemic, which has put a strain on health care, schools and our communities. But the pandemic has also taught us that we are stronger when we stand together. Given the chance to study and work, refugees will continue to contribute to a stronger, safer and more vibrant world,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia. Despite the pandemic, the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people, according to UNHCR’s latest annual Global Trends report released on 18 June. This is a further four per cent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019. World Refugee Day is an opportunity to acknowledge the experiences of the millions of people forced to flee violence and persecution. But it is also a day to celebrate the fact that, with help from welcoming communities and kind neighbours, people can find the strength to heal, rebuild and even thrive. This year, World Refugee Day is focused on the power of inclusion in health systems, education and sports. Health care because of importance of working together to recover from the pandemic. Education because of the millions of children whose education was interrupted by the pandemic. And sports because it transcends language and nationality to bring people together. In 2021, a team of 29 refugee athletes will join the Tokyo Games with the support of UNHCR and the International Olympic and Paralympic Committees.
The ISG noted the precipitating socio-economic crisis in Lebanon, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. It expressed its concern at the increasing tensions in the country, including the recent protests. The ISG called for demonstrations to remain peaceful, for human rights to be protected. It further called for full accountability and justice to be served, through credible, transparent and swift investigations of the Beirut port explosion and the killing of Mr. Lokman Slim. In the context of these developments, the ISG recalled with consternation that seven months have elapsed since the resignation of the last government, inhibiting Lebanon’s ability to address its deepening and increasingly complex political, social, financial, economic and institutional challenges, and to meet the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Lebanese people. The ISG reiterated its urgent call for Lebanon’s leaders to delay no longer the formation of a fully empowered government capable of meeting the country’s urgent needs and implementing critical reforms. The ISG reiterated its firm and continuing support for Lebanon and its people. The International Support Group has brought together the United Nations and the governments of China, France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, together with the European Union and the Arab League. It was launched in September 2013 by the UN Secretary-General with former President Michel Sleiman to help mobilize support and assistance for Lebanon’s stability, sovereignty and state institutions.
The tool helps to systematically collect, and structure collected information related to regional COVID-19 response and to store it in one place. The electronic portal PHRM was launched in October 2020 together with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Public Health Center. It allows the Ministry of Health (MoH), UPHC, regional health authorities and other stakeholders to monitor the policies and epidemiological situation across regions in a systematic manner. This is the first tool of its kind among the countries of the WHO European Region. It builds on the joint initiative between the WHO Regional Office for the European Region, the European Commission and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, and the Health System Response Monitor (HSRM)1. Using the findings of the tool, the national and regional authorities can adjust the COVID-19 response. WHO Representative in Ukraine, Dr Jarno Habicht, highlights that “ this tool is crucial for national and regional authorities to coordinate restriction measures, interventions, policies and messages for the COVID-19 response in Ukraine.” As WHO Representative in Ukraine, Dr Jarno Habicht added that ”the tool could also be a useful source of information in investigation of new outbreaks in a given region, for instance relaxing public health measure and allowing big congregation of people resulting in high infection rates in subsequent weeks. With the tool, the emergency coordination centers in the Ministry of Health and the Ukrainian Public Health Center will be able to regularly check what is the epidemiological picture and for example, governance or financing arrangements on COVID-19 response in Lviv region as compared to Zhytomir and if/how these differ from national standards and policies.” Data collection in the regions began in May 2020 and took place in several rounds. The monitoring is focused on health-related measures taken by regional authorities to cope with the outbreak. "Сoordination of all actions with the regions is extremely important today. We welcome the tools that facilitate this coordination and help us to provide the most effective public health response to COVID-19. We're discovering the opportunities of regional monitoring and consider the possibility of integrating it into the daily work of emergency coordination centers to support our public health response.," said Deputy Minister of Health, Chief State Sanitary Doctor of Ukraine Viktor Liashko. The findings of the tool so far demonstrate that there is considerable variation in the implementation of measures in the regions, reflecting general capacity of the region and leadership of regional authorities. Also, study identified some gaps legislation in the field of public health which should be adressed by authorities. On the positive side, in several regions (e.g. Chernivtsi, Volyn), previously neglected facilities of the Laboratory Centers of the MOH were renovated during the quarantine period. ”Large decentralized countries, such as Ukraine, face distinctive coordinating challenges. Subnational governments are responsible for critical aspects of public health measures, managing health facilities, social services, and aspects of economic development. Because such responsibilities are shared among levels of government, coordinated effort is critical. At the same time, subnational governments can have different policy priorities and capacities. Intergovernmental coordination is a constant focus of policy and politics in these countries, but the scale of the COVID-19 crisis creates novel problems, e.g. of who decides whether people can travel across regional borders within countries, or who decides how to respond to regionalized outbreaks as countries reopen”, - says Elina Dale, Health Policy Adviser, WHO Country Office in Ukraine. The Regional Public Health Response Monitor (PHRM) consists of a questionnaire with six blocks of questions on response measures in the areas covering management and coordination, funding, preventing transmission (restrictive measures and physical distancing, epidemiological surveillance and investigation of cases, laboratory testing, health communication), planning of services, case management and support of essential health services during the epidemic (vaccination, pregnancy and childbirth care, EMS, etc.), physical infrastructure and human resources, logistics and operational support. Also, public health data is supplemented with data on the epidemiological situation in each specific region in the dynamics. The Ministry of Health is deeply interested in the initiative. The next step will be a detailed study of response in the most critical areas, such as schools reopening; ensuring access to basic medical services, etc. and further in-depth analysis of the data obtained in conjunction with the epidemiological situation.

INCLUDING HIV PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES IN PAKISTAN’S ESSENTIAL PACKAGE OF HEALTH SERVICES: A PIONEERING INITIATIVE Islamabad, 9 December 2020: The Government of Pakistan has recently launched another landmark initiative, the Essential Package of Health Services—its national version of universal health coverage. Universal health coverage is a globally promoted initiative and is in line with Pakistan’s commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly target 3 on health for all and leaving no one behind. Prime Minister Imran Khan said: “Pakistan has adopted an essential list of health services, which, once implemented, will put into action a set of preventive and curative interventions without stigma, delivered at the primary and secondary levels, that directly impact upon the health of vulnerable populations and marginalized communities; will help to achieve our human development goals; and will reduce the burden of many diseases and conditions, including HIV and AIDS.” The Essential Package of Health Services will benefit everyone, including the furthest marginalized populations in geographically far-flung areas, and will improve access to lifesaving and life-prolonging services. Pakistan has also recognized pro-poor health strategies for responding to the HIV epidemic and the need to significantly increase public-sector investment at the federal and provincial levels to enhance primary health-care services. This comprehensive package, which includes HIV prevention and treatment services, is a compelling vision of a future in which everyone, including people at the grassroots level, has access to health services that are responsive to their needs and are provided in a timely manner. Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, emphasized: “The provision of many health-promotive, preventive and curative services is effectively possible only if woven into the normal delivery of care at the primary level. HIV is not an exception, and its quality of care will benefit greatly once it is part of a universal package.” The Essential Package of Health Services includes specific services for people living with or affected by HIV, including: The 90,000 community-based Lady Health Workers (LHW) all over the country mandated to provide primary, preventive, promotive and curative care services mainly in remote rural and urban slum communities will now play a stronger role in providing HIV education and referral services at the community level. Comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services will now be an integral part of LHW Programme, thus normalizing HIV and reducing HIV related stigma. In the long run, it is expected to increase the uptake of HIV services and improve the quality of lives of people living with and affected by HIV. Highlighting equitable access to health services, Dr Zafar Mirza, former Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health and now WHO Advisor on Universal Health Coverage, said: “Pakistan is well on its way in advancing universal health coverage. Steady expansion of social health insurance for poor people and vulnerable groups and launching of the national essential services package are major milestones. Universal health coverage promotes equity and promotes affirmative action for marginalized and vulnerable people, including people living with HIV, people who use drugs, transgender people and other vulnerable populations. Aware of the limited resources available, the Government of Pakistan is carefully calibrating decisions to ensure it can bring the greatest impact for people in need. Its success depends on the delivery of all interventions that are critical for good health, including prevention and other non-medical interventions, such as awareness-raising, advocacy, treatment adherence support, and linking key populations to friendly health services. “I am so glad this is happening now, and I am excited not only for myself but for my brothers and sisters living with HIV, to benefit from this government program. This programme will help normalize the HIV response in the country along with addressing stigma and discrimination and capacity strengthening of health care providers”, said Asghar Satti, National Coordinator, Association of People Living with HIV and AIDS UNAIDS strongly believes that ensuring access to good-quality services for all, at the time and place where they are needed, is critical to the success of universal health coverage. Dr Maria Elena Filio Borromeo, UNAIDS Country Director for Pakistan, reiterated: “The inclusion of HIV prevention and treatment services in the Essential Package of Health Services is a positive step towards improving access to comprehensive HIV services—not for some but for all. With its effective implementation, Pakistan could sustain its HIV response and potentially end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.” Dr Maria Elena G Filio Borromeo, UNAIDS Country Director Pakistan and Afghanistan, Tel: +92 51 835 5780, Email: borromeom@unaids.org
Every year on 13 October, International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction places a spotlight on how people and communities around the world are reducing their exposure to disasters. This year’s historic monsoon floods were a stark reminder that Bangladesh is truly at the forefront of the climate emergency. The floods were the second highest since 1989 and the second longest since the 1998. With over 5.4 million people directly affected, the impact of the 2020 monsoon floods on lives and livelihoods certainly call for an urgent enhancement of climate adaptation programmes for upgrading the resilience of infrastructures and communities in view of tomorrow’s more extreme and more frequent climate-related events. Given the fast-evolving context, all partners should strengthen their collaboration on risks assessment and risk analysis processes to reduce and to mitigate risks associated with infrastructure development and climate-related events in line with the HumanitarianDevelopment Nexus. In Cox’s Bazar District, Bangladesh, the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) partners – national and international NGOs and UN agencies –work intensively throughout the year with Rohingya refugee and Bangladeshi volunteers to mitigate impacts on communities from heavy rains and strong winds during the monsoon and cyclone seasons. Volunteers are at the centre of the disaster risk reduction response in Cox’s Bazar and are engaged in a wide range of mitigation activities in the camps and surrounding host communities. From providing early warning and rescuing persons from drowning to stabilizing slopes on the hilly terrain to constructing safe pathways, Rohingya and Bangladeshi volunteers are working together to protect communities and save lives while also safeguarding the environment. Humanitarian partners ensure that volunteers are able to maintain COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures. “We trained together with the Rohingya so that they could learn the ways our people have dealt with natural disasters. We shared and discussed with them our experiences,” explained Mahmud, a Bangladeshi Cyclone Preparedness Programme Volunteer. The humanitarian community has in place a 72-hour response plan for an extreme weather events, such as cyclones. The plan was developed in 2018 in cooperation the Government of Bangladesh, and in line with the Government’s Standing Orders on Disaster. “The humanitarian community has collaborated closely with authorities in Cox’s Bazar, building on years of local experience with natural disasters and established disaster risk governance. This has led to fewer injuries, less displacements and more resilient communities in and around the camps,” said Peter Kern, ISCG Acting Senior Coordinator. Host communities and nearly 860,000 Rohingya refugees face extreme weather events throughout the year, impacting their lives. The region is also impacted by climate change, which has affected the annual monsoon and cyclone season. Under the leadership of the Government of Bangladesh, the humanitarian partners and the Rohingya refugee and neighboring Bangladeshi communities are better prepared for disasters this year compared to previous years. Generous contributions from the international community to the 2020 Joint Response Plan (JRP) for Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis make this possible. The 2020 Joint Response plan, which is so far 48.2 percent funded, remains vital to sustain life-saving preparedness and response efforts for extreme weather events, which have become more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bangladesh has an excellent track record in disaster management and, the country is a striking example of effective adaptation to climate change. With the support of the United Nations and the humanitarian community, the 2010 Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) were revised last year and, the English translation of the 2019 SOD has now been released. The cluster approach is embedded into the disaster management protocols in line with international best practices. A handbookon humanitarian coordination and collaboration in Bangladesh for climate-related disasters was published by the Office of the Resident Coordinator in collaboration with UKAid to mark the International Disaster Reduction Day. The handbook is a tool for any organization willing to support Bangladesh’s authorities and communities to prepare for, to respond to and to bounce back from shocks. The International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction was started in 1989, after a call by the United Nations General Assembly for a day to promote a global culture of risk-awareness and disaster reduction. Held every 13 October, the day celebrates how people and communities around the world are reducing their exposure to disasters and raising awareness about the importance of reining in the risks that they face.
MOGADISHU, 21 September 2020— The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are urging parents and caregivers in south and central parts of Somalia to ensure all children aged under five are vaccinated against polio during a special house-to-house immunization campaign, which began yesterday and runs until 23 September. Both agencies are advising health workers and caregivers to observe health and safety measures against COVID-19 during the four-day campaign. This advice comes in the wake of efforts to curb the spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in the south and central parts of Somalia. The strain of polio that is in circulation is different from the wild poliovirus, recently declared as eradicated from Africa, but it can also put communities where not enough children have been vaccinated at risk and leave children paralyzed for life. The outbreak has paralyzed 19 children since late 2017. “The only way to stop such outbreaks from vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio, is to vaccinate every child every time immunization services are offered, either through routine programmes or through such mass campaigns. We all have a moral responsibility to reach and boost the immunity of every last child in Somalia. Owing to access, security and health-seeking behaviour, we are missing a large number of children every year, who are not receiving these life-saving vaccines,” said Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik, WHO Representative for Somalia. During the ongoing campaign, 6 266 vaccinators in urban areas and 2 685 vaccinators in rural areas will be going from door to door to vaccinate 1.65 million children aged under five with oral polio vaccine. In efforts to reach every child possible, an additional 1 125 team supervisors will be visiting households in targeted areas. 3 390 community mobilizers, sensitizing target communities, will play a key role in helping families to understand, trust and accept vaccines. “It is critical that all routine immunizations continue, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Werner Schultink, UNICEF Representative for Somalia. “These vaccination drives will help prevent further outbreaks and will protect children from deadly diseases so they can survive and thrive.” Before the campaign, polio health workers were trained and supplied with personal protective equipment, including face masks, soap and hand sanitizer, to keep them and communities safe from COVID-19. This campaign is the first step in a two-part effort to raise immunity levels among Somali children. Somalia’s Government, WHO and UNICEF will conduct the second part of the campaign in October to continue to strengthen the immunity of Somali children. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to accept the vaccine when it is offered to give their children life-long protection against polio. This polio campaign is supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), an organization dedicated to the eradication of polio. Launched in 1988, the GPEI is spearheaded by national governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF, and supported by key partners including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.
The conference titled “Second Regional Thematic Conference on Reintegration, Return and Labour Migration in the Context of Covid-19 pandemic” is the second in a series of three regional conferences to be held on topics of regional interest within the migration field. This high level event triggered exchanges on the experiences and lessons learned of governments within the region in responding to the socio-economic impacts and opportunities of return migration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three main thematic areas were investigated: (i) Social and Economic Reintegration into Slowing Economies and Labour Markets; (ii) Leveraging the Return of Skilled Migrants for Economic Development and; (iii) Re-Opening Safe, Regular Labour Migration Channels. The event took place online and was organized within the framework of the project “Enhancing Migrants’ Rights and Good Governance in Armenia and Georgia (EMERGE)” funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway. The conference opened with an address by Ilona Ter-Minasyan, Head of Office, IOM Armenia, who outlined the potential of returning migrants to support the better recovery for countries participating in this conference post-COVID-19 pandemic. “This is part of our efforts to initiate and maintain and energize the migration management-related dialogue amongst the countries in the region…This year we are moving to another set of issues and challenges which are shared across the region and which are particular relevant in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are soon to enter year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has completely changed our environment in which we operate and has put additional challenges both to migrants and migration and to entities and the governments who are participating in migration management and facilitating migration management” said IOM Georgia Chief of Mission, Sanja Celebic Lukovac. The highlight of the event was the keynote speech delivered by Prithwiraj (Raj) Choudhury, the Lumry Family Associate Professor at the Harvard Business School. Mr. Choudhury spoke about the steps of Government to Promote Remote Working Models. The Professor summarized his presentation by stating: “Work from anywhere and remote work can help regions that have lost talent to brain drain to attract talent. It can happen nationally through digital nomad visa or programmes such as Start-Up Chile, it can happen regionally using incentives such as Tulsa Remote programme.” The conference report is being finalized and the highlights will be presented at an online event scheduled to take place in January 2022.
As elsewhere in the world, women in Ukraine represent a large proportion of the agricultural labour force and the majority of food producers, and thus play key roles in managing natural resources and promoting the well-being of their families. To explore and analyse gender issues in agriculture and food security, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed the first Country Gender Assessment for Ukraine,. The report – part of FAO’s Country Gender Assessment series, and whose full title is ‘National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine)’ – aims to serve policymakers and practitioners engaged in the formulation and implementation of agriculture policies and programmes, researchers and analysts, civil society actors, and other partners. The report acknowledges women’s role in food systems and rural development, yet it also points out their unequal access to land and other assets and resources, which limits their economic opportunities and puts them at risk of being left behind. Based on these findings, the report provides recommendations on how to address gender inequalities for increased agricultural productivity and food security, and sustainable rural development. Greater agricultural productivity, food security and rural livelihoods, says the report, cannot be achieved without recognising the distinct and complementary roles of women and men, and ensuring social and economic equality for both groups. “The report contributes to the existing knowledge base about gender equality in the country, by bringing together gender statistics and experts’ opinions, but also serving as an advocacy tool to provide greater visibility to rural women’s contribution to agricultural productivity and food security,” said Mara Lopes, FAO Ukraine Head of Office. “Women and girls are critical agents in the fight against rural poverty and food insecurity. Supporting them in reaching their full potential will enable agricultural and rural development processes to be more effective.” “The FAO report on Gender, Agriculture and Rural Development is an in-depth and comprehensive document covering gender issues in the context of different areas of women's and men's lives, including participation in decision-making, freedom from violence, the impact of climate change, access to resources such as land, water energy, education, health and more,” added Kateryna Levchenko, Government Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy. “This makes it a relevant source of information for all a wide range of users”. However, the report finds that rural women in Ukraine are limited in their capacity to contribute to agricultural production and take advantage of new opportunities, being concentrated in informal jobs and overloaded by multiple responsibilities. These include unpaid informal work on family farms, daily housework, and caring for children and other family members. Despite the heavy workload, their effort is often invisible and receives little recognition or economic or social reward. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many women across the region find themselves in an even more disadvantaged situation, as evidence points to increased rates of domestic violence and longer hours of care work due to the widespread closure of schools,” said Dono Abdurazakova, FAO Senior Gender and Social Protection Advisor. “Rural women with disabilities, women from ethnic minority groups such as Roma women, women who have been internally displaced, and many more, suffer from multiple vulnerabilities.” One in every six people employed in Ukraine works in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The report reveals that specific job types within that sector tend to fall into either “female” or “male” occupation categories. Men represent 71 percent of all formal employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, whereas women in the same sector tend to work informally. Women make up 56 percent of migrant labour in Ukraine as a whole, and 58 percent of migrant labour in rural areas. Men are more likely to migrate abroad, while women tend to migrate internally. Unsurprisingly, only 20 percent of farming enterprises in Ukraine are headed by women. What is perhaps more surprising is that women generally undertake manual labour, such as cultivation, planting, weeding, and harvesting perishable vegetables, berries and herbs. Men, meanwhile, tend to undertake mechanised work such as tilling, ploughing and planting fodder crops, harvesting grain and corn (with combine harvesters), and transporting products to markets. Men are more likely to engage in large-scale crop production (wheat, corn, sunflowers), while women typically focus on horticulture and herbs. The tendency towards distinct tasks is repeated within the livestock sector, with women active in dairy production and work associated with milking and care of cows, and men usually responsible for transportation and mechanised labour. The report also goes into some detail on food, health and nutrition, broken down by the female and male experience in Ukraine. In terms of life expectancy, Ukrainian women live on average 10 years longer than men, and that gap is even more pronounced in rural communities (76.2 years compared with 65.6 years for men in 2019). This is a pattern reflected across all post-Soviet countries. In Western Europe, by comparison, female life expectancy exceeds that of their male counterparts by just five years.

Monday, June 28, 2021, within the “Revival Mosul and Basra Old Cities” project, funded by the European Union, and in the presence of the Governor of Nineveh, Mr. Najm al-Jubouri, the Mayor of Mosul, Zouhair Al Araji, Officer-in-Charge and Head of Culture at the UNESCO Office in Iraq, Mr. Junaid Sorosh-Wali, Consul General of the Republic of Korea, Mr. Choi Kwang Jin, and Director of the Department of Labor and Vocational Training, Ms. Mithaq Talib, UNESCO celebrates the inauguration of new training facilities at the Vocational Training Center in Mosul. In his opening remarks, Mr. Najm al-Jubouri, Governor of Nineveh, welcomed the participants at the Department of Labour and Vocational Training in Mosul, and said “On this occasion, we thank UNESCO and the European Union, which funded these training workshops, and we hope in the future that new areas will be opened in addition to the field of construction, which is now being focused on in order to involve young people in the reconstruction process, as well as targeting the neediest youth who will engage in the fields of work needed by the labour market”. Ms. Barbara Egger, Head of Cooperation for the European Union in Iraq confirmed that “the European Union will continue support Mosul stabilization and reconstruction process. However, we believe that the recovery process should be led and implemented by the Mosulawi themselves. Mosul youth should be empowered to lead the economic and social reforms in the governorate. The EU supports several initiatives in Mosul for this specific purpose. I am pleased to see the expansion of this vocational centre. It is particularly important to provide specialized training in construction techniques to young Mouslawis to rebuild their city. I am equally delighted to see young Mouslawis enrolled in the training courses and I am looking forward to these Mouslawis graduate and join the job market.” In his welcoming remarks Mr. Sorosh-Wali said, “I am delighted to see more than 200, including 25 female, TVET trainees attending the UNESCO-run construction courses here to gain the skills that will enable them to access the labour market and find jobs. I am also happy to see another 115 trainees (8 female) attending courses at Nineveh Vocational School at the same time, also supported by UNESCO. As UNESCO, we believe that today, more than ever, young men and women are change makers, building a new reality for themselves and their communities. Young people around the world are driving social change and innovation, respecting their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and looking for new opportunities to learn and work together for a better future.” He added, “I am pleased to be here at the Vocational Training Center in Mosul today and to see the progress of the UNESCO project especially by increasing the center’s capacity to host 100 additional new trainees by rebuilding 4 training rooms. I am also interested in hearing the opinions of the trainees who will share their success stories.” And plans for them after they graduate!" Through the project, UNESCO is working to provide vocational training in construction to 1,550 vulnerable youth trainees in Mosul and Basra, providing real opportunities for the social and economic development of the community. Increasing access to and achievement of TVET is fundamental to ensuring more equitable access to better living conditions, increasingly specialized and better-paid jobs, a more sustainable environment as well as more sustainable economic and social development. In an interview with Mr. Bilal Al-Hamaydah, the Project Officer, he said, “TVET is one of UNESCO’s priorities in Iraq. As the lead agency for the reform of the TVET sector in Iraq, UNESCO continues to support the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, the Ministry of Education and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor in Iraq. Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals 4, 8 and 11, which emphasize an increase in the number of young people with relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship”. He emphasized that the project, generously funded by the European Union, aims to provide income generation opportunities for young job-seekers and returnees in the Old City of Mosul through the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the historic urban landscape. The added value of the project is the combination of intensive employment schemes, restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction of demolished and damaged homes and buildings in the old town. So far, 244 VTC graduates have joined the worksites of 44 heritage houses under reconstruction in the Old City of Mosul. Ms. Mithaq Taleb, Director of the Department of Labor and Vocational Training in Nineveh Governorate, said, “I really hope that this project will enhance local ownership and self-reliance and provide direct alternatives to young people, making them less vulnerable to extremism. The employment created through reconstruction and urban renewal processes will benefit the local economy, while promoting resilience, cultural identity and social cohesion. "The targeted activities of the project, with a focus on engaging young men and women, will contribute positively to changing people's lives through medium and long-term job opportunities with a time period that exceeds the immediate time frame of the proposed project," she added. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
A UNHCR delegation headed by the Representative in Iraq, Ms. Philippa Candler, visited the Governor of Erbil, Mr. Omed Abdulrahman Hassan. They discussed cooperation and humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons living in Erbil governorate, in particular UNHCRs structural contributions to towns hosting refugee camps. UNHCR will increase its engagement with local communities that has opened their doors to refugees and undertakes to work with the government to improve the services and infrastructure in towns in Erbil hosting refugee camps. The Governor reaffirmed his commitment towards supporting persons forced to flee their homes who have found shelter in Erbil. During the meeting the Governor presented UNHCR with a plaque as a tangible sign of his appreciation of the role and contributions of the organization. "This plaque is a reflection of the strong and positive cooperation between the Government and UNHCR in Erbil. I appreciate the commitment of the Governor of Erbil to protect and support the 135,000 refugees living in Erbil Governorate - half of all refugees in the country. UNHCR will continue to work closely with the Governor and his team in support of refugees and the areas in the governorate generously hosting them,” Philippa Candler said. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.

The JEG members representing the UN Country Team, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population, the Ministry of Trade and Foreign Economic Relations of Turkmenistan, the State Committee on Statistics, the Central Bank and the State Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of Turkmenistan agreed on the main goals and objectives of the Group and discussed approaches to promote SDG financing through various activities under the integrated financing framework mechanism. “The establishment of the Joint Expert Group on financing the SDGs in Turkmenistan today is another proof of Turkmenistan's readiness to fulfil its commitments under Addis Ababa Action Agenda and support global initiatives in the area of financing for SDGs at the national level. As expected, the work of this group will support the national efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Turkmenistan”, noted Ms. Natia Natsvlishvili, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. and UNDP Resident Representative a.i. in Turkmenistan. Implementation of the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) will contribute to the development of such strategic priorities of Turkmenistan as the development of the financial planning and budgeting, improvement of the investment climate and business environment, development of capital markets and the introduction of innovative financial instruments.
The new legislative mechanism to be developed will be a supporting the implementation of a new model of agricultural advisory services and a five-year strategy which will be submitted to the Government of Azerbaijan by the project. Project specialists were included in the working group on the draft law preparation on AAS. The experts presented the Agricultural Advisory Service model tailored to Azerbaijan to the working group, informed them about the regulations required between the government bodies, private sector and civil society for the workability of this model, and advised that the legislation should be established in accordance with these requirements. With the participation of the lead technical officer of the project, FAO extension officer Nevena Alexandrova, three webinars were organized for the working group on “Governance and coordination in a pluralistic AAS system”, “Funding mechanisms and partnerships for AAS in Azerbaijan” and “Increased knowledge, innovation quality assurance and qualification for AAS in Azerbaijan”. The expert elucidated to the webinar participants how the model proposed by the project reflects the funding of agricultural advisory services, the establishment of partnerships and regulation of relations between the parties, addressing the gaps, access to innovations and new knowledge. Ms. Alexandrova made clear that the model was developed using the good practices of European countries that are relevant to the situation in Azerbaijan and taking into account the local specifics on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the status of the advisory system in the country, including regional mapping and inclusive and participatory discussion. The FAO expert explained the role of the Government in the new model of AAS, the positions of key players and the functions of groups that will communicate directly with farmers and serve them. She stressed that the draft law must involve the regulations of relations between all these groups, the clear expression of the roles of each participant and the creation of incentives for the participation of the private sector in the agricultural advisory services system. It should be noted that in addition to preparing the five-year strategy, the project "Strengthening of Agrarian Advisory Services" also works to pilot the proposed model in two selected regions of the country - Ganja-Gazakh and Guba-Khachmaz.
Information and communication technologies have been invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. They help us to stay connected, and to keep vital services and businesses going. Yet almost half the world is still offline – and most of those who lack access to digital technology are women and girls in developing countries. Latest figures from the International Telecommunication Union show a 17 per cent gender gap in internet use globally. This is even wider in least developed countries. In some regions, this gender gap is growing, reinforcing gender inequalities by denying women and girls opportunities to access education, find better-paid jobs, and start new businesses. Making these technologies available to all is an essential part of building back stronger communities and economies, and addressing many of the world’s most pressing challenges. International Girls in ICT Day aims to inspire a global movement to increase the representation of girls and women in technology. Today, let’s recommit to the goal of equal access for young women and girls to opportunities in science, technology, engineering and math.
“Preserving our environment guide UN’s COVID response and recovery programmes” “Preserving our environment guide UN’s COVID response and recovery programmes” The United Nations chose 5 June to be the World Environment Day to stress the importance of our environment, nature and planet for all people globally. It is an opportunity to raise awareness of decision makers and communities about environmental challenges and related threats that goes beyond nations and generations. This year, we are witnessing one of the most severe global crises that is affecting everyone around the world. COVID-19 is not just a pandemic that hit the health sector, but its consequences reached out to all aspects of our lives including the environmental sectors. The impact of the measures undertaken to mitigate the risks of the pandemic had dual effect on environment. The mandatory usage of facial masks, gloves and hand sanitizers resulted in generation of a massive amount of medical wastes in the environment. On the other hand, the gas emissions are getting lower since the suspension of flights and transport systems. Cristina Albertin (The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Egypt ad interim) stated that “The United Nations in Egypt is strongly committed to supporting Egypt in overcoming the challenges resulted from COVID-19 by putting the environmental sustainability and natural resource management among the priorities of its response and recovery plans.” The core of these priorities is supporting national efforts to manage Egypt’s natural resources, mitigate environmental hazards and foster a greener economy and society. It is time to further position environment preservation and sustainable development as an engine for growth. It generates opportunities in areas such as agriculture, waste management, renewable energy, hence improving the lives of people. Each one can play an active role in protecting the nature and biodiversity which will also result in protecting us against pandemics.
We call for speech that shows full respect for the humanity and dignity of the other. “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” Although seemingly simple and straightforward, article 1 of the Universal Human Rights Declaration remains a far cry for many. Discrimination but also other violations of fundamental human rights remain a reality for too many people around the world today. Respect for the human rights of all is fundamental for sustainable peace and inclusive development. This was so the case in 1948, when the Universal Declaration was adopted, and it remains so today. In his Call to Action for Human Rights last year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that human rights are essential to addressing the causes and impact of today's complex crises, and to building sustainable, safe, and peaceful societies. In tackling the challenges we face, everyone’s opinion and criticism count. Everyone deserves space to express views freely and without fear, though – as international human rights law states – with respect for the special duties and responsibilities this freedom carries, one of which is respect for the rights of others. Here we have noted a challenge, one that is not unique to Montenegro: hate speech. We have observed hate speech based on ethnicity, national identity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliation. It denigrates, dehumanizes, discriminates and excludes. It has led to a few hate crimes. Hate speech can threaten peaceful societies as the Special Adviser on the Prevention Genocide, who leads the UN in tackling the phenomenon and who visited Montenegro in November, often warns about. On the occasion of International Human Rights Day, the UN Country Team in Montenegro calls for more rather than less speech to counter the challenge that hate speech presents to our societies. We call for speech that shows full respect for the humanity and dignity of the other. And we ask leaders, may they be political, religious or otherwise, but also those who have influence, like traditional and the online media, to serve as examples. Let us all use this essential freedom for what it is meant – to create free, open, respectful societies in which everyone has an opportunity to take part, makes their voice heard and to ultimately contribute to a better life for all.
UNFPA Albania ran a technical meeting with the champion companies on gender-responsive family policies including, Raiffeisen Bank, Rogner Hotel, AGFA Group, Inca Fish, FIX Pro, R&T, and key partners in Albania to establish a network of collaborators, agree on immediate follow up steps, share feedback and provide recommendations for successful implementation of family-friendly policies at the workplace. Other interested partners joined the discussions, like the Union of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Women Economic Chamber, etc. This intervention is part of the regional UNFPA Eastern Europe & Central Asia project “Expanding Choices: Gender-Responsive Family Policies for the Private Sector in the Western Balkans and Moldova” financially supported by the Austrian Development Agency - AustrianDevelopmentCooperation (ADC).
