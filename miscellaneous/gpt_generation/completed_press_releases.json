They are also essential for designing effective, evidence-based responses to the crisis and to drive an inclusive and sustainable recovery, that leaves no one behind. While data is critical for policymaking in \u2018normal times\u2019, the pandemic has served to further elevate the importance of data to save lives and to recover better. Cambodia has made progress in increasing the availability of data, however significant data gaps exist, including in the level of disaggregation required, geographical coverage and timeliness.[1] The United Nations has prioritised assistance to the Royal Government of Cambodia to improve the quality, accessibility and disaggregation of data and statistics. The United Nations is working to strengthen national capacity to enable this and is contributing to the production of reliable data that is needed to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Assistance also centres on improving national capacity for the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other national indicators to foster achievement of the 2030 Agenda. In line with this, the United Nations is supporting the Ministry of Planning and the National Institute of Statistics, as well as line Ministries to improve the availability and utilization of data for sustainable development including to better link data to planning and budgeting processes. The focus has been on providing support for the implementation and roll out of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) to enhance statistical systems in line with international standards. The United Nations is also supporting the collection of key statistical data through national census, demographic, social and economic surveys, and administrative data systems that will provide quality data for use in monitoring national development frameworks and to guide policy direction. This incorporates support for the Government\u2019s SDG monitoring and reporting along with the setup of the National Development/SDGs Indicators Reporting and Data Exchange among Government line ministries through the National Platform - CAMSTAT which includes a CSDG/SDG tracking portal. In the current context of the pandemic, reliable data will be essential to support SDG acceleration efforts to enable Cambodia to remain on track to achieve the SDGs. The United Nations has carried out a series of rapid assessments and surveys, together with its partners to collect data to better understand the varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health, society and the economy especially for vulnerable groups. This has included impact assessments and surveys to glean data on the impact of the pandemic on children, women, youth, people with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, sexual reproductive health, returning migrants, garment workers, informal workers, as well as on small and medium enterprises. Many of the surveys have been undertaken in several rounds and intervals and have contributed to informing government policymaking and programme adjustment to better respond to the evolving COVID 19 situation. The United Nations is also contributing quality data through regular household-based data collection to measure the evolution of food security and nutrition and the effectiveness of mitigation measures in Cambodia. The United Nations carries out remote price and market monitoring in cooperation with the Agricultural Marketing Office (AMO) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and produces monthly monitoring reports (Cambodia Market Update) that provide data and insights on price trends, market functionality and supply chains, agricultural production to understand prevailing market conditions and the implications for households in Cambodia and Government policy responses. The United Nations collects monthly agricultural production data on Cambodia to provide early warning through the Global Information and Early Warning System. This monitoring continues through the COVID-19 pandemic and gives a snapshot of the Earth Observation Indicators targeting seasonal indicators, vegetation indicators, and precipitation indicators. The United Nations agency - World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Health of Cambodia prepare regular COVID-19 situation reports to highlight the most recent developments in the health response to COVID-19. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the United Nations has also supported the Royal Government to track the number of Cambodian returning migrants and the situation at borders and in quarantine to inform more effective policy responses. The United Nations is also working on shock responsive social assistance connecting IDPoor data, with the social protection system and the national disaster management system. Support has also been provided for a range of information management systems such as the Child Protection Information Management System; and Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM). The United Nations worked with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to build some of the first models able to estimate COVID19\u2019s social and economic impact. This work showed how stimulus packages that included social protection not only improve GDP but significantly reduce poverty and unemployment. Further work revealed how reduced access to education due to pandemic conditions caused a reduction in Cambodia\u2019s Human Development Index. To promote wide access to data, the United Nations hosts a public Reports Dashboard, which contains the latest published and upcoming research and assessments on Cambodia, drawn from various partners. This includes research on the impacts of COVID 19. As of 5 July 2021, 168 completed and ongoing assessments were included in the dashboard. The dashboard provides visualizations and simple analytics of reports. It helps to assess and identify knowledge gaps; create benchmarks to track progress in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted challenges and vulnerabilities in data production and systems. The Royal Government of Cambodia, with support from its partners, has made efforts to generate data and evidence to inform policy decision and programme adjustments. In this light, the United Nations encourages the authorities to continue its efforts to strengthen national data and statistical systems to ensure that data can better contribute to leaving no one behind and to fostering equality and sustainable development. To effectively do this, data production systems must respond more effectively and quickly to the changing environment and better anticipate risks. The United Nations encourages better use of digital technologies, innovation, and new data sources to provide more timely data. The United Nations also encourages the authorities to promote greater data literacy and data governance. Highlighting the crucial role data plays in the pandemic response, the United Nations urges the authorities to ensure a balance between protecting public health and the right to privacy. Adequate data privacy and protection of personal information are achieved through appropriate legal and policy measures. At the same time balancing and respecting the importance of ensuring transparency and accessibility to data that is in the public interest is crucial. It is important to adopt a holistic and whole-of-government approach to data governance with the engagement of all stakeholders and partners across sectors. Greater effort is required to overcome data silos and priority should be placed on enhancing the capacity for the collection of disaggregated data to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable groups that are most impacted by the pandemic. The United Nations will continue to partner with the Royal Government and other partners to improve the availability, timeliness and utilization of quality data and statistics necessary to respond to the pandemic, future crisis and to accelerate action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

It is important to adopt a holistic and whole-of-government approach to data governance with the engagement of all stakeholders and partners across sectors. Greater effort is required to overcome data silos and priority should be placed on enhancing the capacity for the collection of disaggregated data to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable groups that are most impacted by the pandemic. The United Nations will continue to partner with the Royal Government and other partners to improve the availability, timeliness and utilization of quality data and statistics necessary to respond to the pandemic, future crisis and to accelerate action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. UN Cambodia\u2019s Response to COVID-19 Information Notes are official documents from the United Nations in Cambodia intended for the media and other partners. They are prepared by the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator.

            "ratio_1/3": "Timely and reliable disaggregated data and official statistics are critical for understanding, managing, and mitigating the health, social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. They are also essential for designing effective, evidence-based responses to the crisis and to drive an inclusive and sustainable recovery, that leaves no one behind. While data is critical for policymaking in \u2018normal times\u2019, the pandemic has served to further elevate the importance of data to save lives and to recover better. Cambodia has made progress in increasing the availability of data, however significant data gaps exist, including in the level of disaggregation required, geographical coverage and timeliness.[1] The United Nations has prioritised assistance to the Royal Government of Cambodia to improve the quality, accessibility and disaggregation of data and statistics. The United Nations is working to strengthen national capacity to enable this and is contributing to the production of reliable data that is needed to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Assistance also centres on improving national capacity for the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other national indicators to foster achievement of the 2030 Agenda. In line with this, the United Nations is supporting the Ministry of Planning and the National Institute of Statistics, as well as line Ministries to improve the availability and utilization of data for sustainable development including to better link data to planning and budgeting processes. The focus has been on providing support for the implementation and roll out of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) to enhance statistical systems in line with international standards. The United Nations is also supporting the collection of key statistical data through national census, demographic, social and economic surveys, and administrative data systems that will provide quality data for use in monitoring national development frameworks and to guide policy direction. This incorporates support for the Government\u2019s SDG monitoring and reporting along with the setup of the National Development/SDGs Indicators Reporting and Data Exchange among Government line ministries through the National Platform - CAMSTAT which includes a CSDG/SDG tracking portal. In the current context of the pandemic, reliable data will be essential to support SDG acceleration efforts to enable Cambodia to remain on track to achieve the SDGs. The United Nations has carried out a series of rapid assessments and surveys, together with its partners to collect data to better understand the varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health, society and the economy especially for vulnerable groups. This has included impact assessments and surveys to glean data on the impact of the pandemic on children, women, youth, people with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, sexual reproductive health, returning migrants, garment workers, informal workers, as well as on small and medium enterprises. Many of the surveys have been undertaken in several rounds and intervals and have contributed to informing government policymaking and programme adjustment to better respond to the evolving COVID 19 situation. The United Nations is also contributing quality data through regular household-based data collection to measure the evolution of food security and nutrition and the effectiveness of mitigation measures in Cambodia. The United Nations carries out remote price and market monitoring in cooperation with the Agricultural Marketing Office (AMO) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and produces monthly monitoring reports (Cambodia Market Update) that provide data and insights on price trends, market functionality and supply chains, agricultural production to understand prevailing market conditions and the implications for households in Cambodia and Government policy responses. The United Nations collects monthly agricultural production data on Cambodia to provide early warning through the Global Information and Early Warning System. This monitoring continues through the COVID-19 pandemic and gives a snapshot of the Earth Observation Indicators targeting seasonal indicators, vegetation indicators, and precipitation indicators. The United Nations agency - World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Health of Cambodia prepare regular COVID-19 situation reports to highlight the most recent developments in the health response to COVID-19. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the United Nations has also supported the Royal Government to track the number of Cambodian returning migrants and the situation at borders and in quarantine to inform more effective policy responses. The United Nations is also working on shock responsive social assistance connecting IDPoor data, with the social protection system and the national disaster management system. Support has also been provided for a range of information management systems such as the Child Protection Information Management System; and Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM). The United Nations worked with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to build some of the first models able to estimate COVID19\u2019s social and economic impact. This work showed how stimulus packages that included social protection not only improve GDP but significantly reduce poverty and unemployment. Further work revealed how reduced access to education due to pandemic conditions caused a reduction in Cambodia\u2019s Human Development Index. To promote wide access to data, the United Nations hosts a public Reports Dashboard, which contains the latest reports and analyses produced by various UN agencies. The Dashboard provides an easy-to-access, user-friendly interface where policymakers, researchers, and the general public can obtain up-to-date information and evidence-based insights necessary for decision-making and policy formulation.\n\nIn addition to enhancing data collection and analysis, the United Nations has been active in ensuring that data is utilized effectively to support inclusive and equitable policies. This includes capacity building initiatives aimed at government officials and stakeholders to use data analytics tools and methodologies for policy planning and implementation. Training programs and workshops are being conducted to improve data literacy across different sectors, fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making.\n\nA priority area of the United Nations' intervention has also been strengthening collaborative frameworks and partnerships to enhance data sharing and utilization among various stakeholders, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and international partners. By facilitating data exchange and promoting interoperability of various data systems, the United Nations is helping to create a more cohesive and comprehensive data ecosystem in Cambodia.\n\nAn essential component of these efforts is the focus on vulnerable and marginalized populations. The United Nations is dedicated to ensuring that no one is left behind in the recovery process. Special emphasis is placed on generating disaggregated data that highlight disparities and inform targeted interventions to address the needs of groups such as children, women, people with disabilities, and informal sector workers. This approach helps to identify and respond to inequalities, making policies more inclusive and effective.\n\nThrough its multi-faceted support for data and statistical systems, the United Nations aims to ensure that Cambodia not only responds effectively to the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic but also builds a resilient foundation for sustainable development. The ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic underscore the critical importance of robust data systems for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\n\nAs part of its commitment to transparency and accountability, the United Nations continues to update and disseminate its findings, methodologies, and best practices through various channels, including reports, policy briefs, and public forums. By sharing knowledge and fostering dialogue, the United Nations is working to create a well-informed community capable of collaborative problem-solving and innovation in addressing development challenges.\n\nIn summary, the United Nations' comprehensive support to Cambodia ranges from immediate data collection and analysis for pandemic response to long-term capacity building and system strengthening for sustainable development. These efforts contribute significantly to Cambodia's ability to manage current crises and future challenges, ensuring that development benefits all segments of society.",

The United Nations has carried out a series of rapid assessments and surveys, together with its partners to collect data to better understand the varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health, society and the economy especially for vulnerable groups. This has included impact assessments and surveys to measure the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on households and businesses, which are critical for informing policy interventions aimed at mitigating the adverse outcomes of the pandemic. The urgency to gather, analyze, and utilize real-time data has never been higher, and the UN's targeted efforts are enabling Cambodia to address these needs more effectively.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned efforts, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been actively involved in a series of initiatives designed to bolster data gathering infrastructure and analytical capacity. This includes programs aimed at training national and local statisticians, enhancing data collection methodologies, and integrating advanced data analytics technologies. By fostering an environment where accurate data can be collected efficiently and analyzed precisely, the UNDP is ensuring that Cambodia can proactively manage not just the current pandemic but future public health crises as well.\n\nComplementing the UN's work, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has been instrumental in ensuring that data reflects the unique challenges faced by children and adolescents during the pandemic. UNICEF's periodic surveys and data initiatives focus on critical indicators including education access, nutrition, and mental health, thus ensuring that interventions can be designed to support young people through these unprecedented times. By putting a spotlight on the needs of the younger population, UNICEF reaffirms the importance of inclusive development and equitable support systems.\n\nMoreover, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is concentrating efforts on the gendered impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing that women and girls often face disproportionate challenges during crises, UNFPA is conducting gender-based assessments to provide data that help tailor responses to safeguard women\u2019s health, rights, and socioeconomic status. These efforts involve working closely with community organizations to collect disaggregated data that highlights the differential impacts based on gender, and to craft gender-sensitive policies that promote equality and protection against exploitation and abuse.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) are also key players in ensuring food security data is robust. With food systems being drastically affected by COVID-19, it's vital to monitor agricultural production, supply chain disruptions, and food prices. Both FAO and WFP are conducting regular surveys and assessments to evaluate food security levels across Cambodia. This data is then utilized to implement programs that aim to support both immediate relief efforts and long-term food stability, ensuring that vulnerable populations do not suffer from hunger or malnutrition.\n\nCoordination across United Nations agencies is facilitated by mechanisms such as the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) frameworks, which ensure a unified approach to data and resource sharing. This collaborative model allows for the optimization of resources and minimization of redundancies, ensuring that every effort contributes to a collective, comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground.\n\nFurthermore, digital transformation is a cornerstone of the UN's efforts in Cambodia. Initiatives to digitize data collection and reporting ensure that data is more accurate, timely, and accessible. The transition from paper-based methods to digital systems enables quicker response times and more dynamic data management. The UN is supporting the Royal Government of Cambodia in upgrading its technological infrastructure, which also serves the broader goal of enhancing the digital economy and governance.\n\nOne specific technology-driven initiative is the enhancement of the CAMSTAT platform. CAMSTAT's SDG tracking portal, supported by the UN, is a revolutionary step in transparent and integrated data management. This platform allows various government ministries to input and exchange data, providing a real-time, cohesive picture of national progress towards SDG targets. It also facilitates public access to data, promoting accountability and fostering civic engagement.\n\nIn essence, the integrated data efforts led by the United Nations not only aim to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic but also strengthen Cambodia\u2019s resilience and capacity to withstand future crises. This comprehensive support structure ensures that Cambodia remains on the trajectory to achieving its SDG commitments by 2030.\n\nLooking ahead, continuous investment in data systems is imperative. The United Nations pledges to remain a steadfast partner to the Royal Government of Cambodia, offering expertise, resources, and innovation to enhance the nation's data capabilities. By fortifying statistical systems and promoting a culture of data-informed decision making, the UN's initiatives create a foundation for sustainable development and inclusive growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the multifaceted approach undertaken by the United Nations in Cambodia underscores the critical role of data in navigating crises and fostering recovery. Ensuring that data is timely, reliable, and disaggregated empowers policymakers to design interventions that make tangible differences in people's lives. As Cambodia progresses towards a post-pandemic future, the UN's unwavering support and partnership will remain a central pillar in its journey towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring no one is left behind.",

Regrettably, it is clear that the actions we are taking in terms of science, technology and innovation are not yet making an impact across critical sectors such as agriculture, energy, environment, health, infrastructure development, mining, security and water among others that contribute to Africa\u2019s transformation, , nor at the scale and pace needed to achieve the 17 Goals. We all must join forces, with multi-stakeholder platforms as the one that TICAD represents for Africa, and leverage new opportunities in science, technology and innovation to create the continent we are all striving for. The potential of STI in Africa rests on building and/or upgrading research infrastructures; enhancing professional and technical competencies; promoting entrepreneurship and innovation; and providing an enabling environment for STI development across Africa. There are emerging opportunities to accelerate progress in this regard, particularly in terms of what is sometimes referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution \u2013 demonstrating the magnitude of the change \u2013, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchains and machine learning are transforming societies, economies, public and private sector organizations, and individuals across the globe. These emerging technologies have the potential to advance sustainable development and lead to greater development impact \u2013 while also presenting a risk to drive us apart and fuel inequality. As such, mobilizing public, private and donor resources to finance Research and Development and creating an enabling environment for multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration in open Innovation and Entrepreneurship remains the key to accelerating Africa\u2019s transition to an innovation-led, Knowledge-based Economy. Fostering innovation for accelerated socio-economic gain is now a priority for UNDP in Africa and our organization has just launched its first Digital Strategy, which is a call to action and innovation both for UN and our network of partners. Financing the SDGs \u2013 both through public and private resources \u2013 is at the core of UNDP\u2019s efforts. As a systemic challenge, it demands the re-orientation of how public and private actors interact with each other to achieve the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. The required collective efforts by governments, the private sector, philanthropy and civil society as well as the necessary re-shaping of markets to become more inclusive, equitable and sustainable must make use of technological advances and innovative financing approaches, in particular financing schemes that combine the resources and technical expertise of both the public and private sector. Turning to intra-African trade, which has recently received a boost through the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and can promote inclusion and equality, digitization can lower barriers to entry and help connect Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with global markets and value chains, providing the necessary services to facilitate their exports, such as simplified payments and logistics. With the right policies in place, e-commerce in Africa could reach 75 billion USD by 2025 and could be of particular benefit to MSMEs, which constitute more than 80 per cent of African enterprises. Overwhelming successes are already emerging, such as Jumia, the \u201cAfrican Amazon\u201d, which has become the continent\u2019s first unicorn being valued at over 1 billion USD. However, for trade to take full advantage of technology and innovation, African countries must first close the digital divide and increase access to technologies in order to ensure the broader adoption of digital technologies. African governments need to pursue industrialization by combining physical and digital infrastructure improvements. Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires urgent investments in human capital development that is tailored to the changing needs of businesses. With the rise in new technologies and automation globally, the continent is primed to exploit such opportunities because of a young and more educated population. YouthConnekt Africa, a multi-dimensional youth empowerment programme implemented in approx. ten African countries, and the complementary YAS! Youth for Africa and SDGs initiative that focuses on youth entrepreneurship on the continental level, are clear examples of this approach that UNDP supports.

Turning to intra-African trade, which has recently received a boost through the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and can promote inclusion and equality, digitization can lower barriers to entry and help connect Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with global markets and value chains, providing the necessary services to facilitate their exports, such as simplified payments and logistics. With the right policies in place, e-commerce in Africa could reach 75 billion USD by 2025 and could be of particular benefit to MSMEs, which constitute more than 80 per cent of African enterprises. Overwhelming successes are already emerging, such as Jumia, the \u201cAfrican Amazon\u201d, which has become the continent\u2019s first unicorn being valued at over 1 billion USD. However, for trade to take full advantage of technology and innovation, African countries must first close the digital divide and increase access to technologies in order to ensure the broader adoption of digital technologies. African governments need to pursue industrialization by combining physical and digital infrastructure improvements. Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires urgent investments in human capital development that is tailored to the changing needs of businesses. With the rise in new technologies and automation globally, the continent is primed to exploit such opportunities because of a young and more educated population. YouthConnekt Africa, a multi-dimensional youth empowerment programme implemented in approx. ten African countries, and the complementary YAS! Youth for Africa and SDGs initiative that focuses on youth entrepreneurship on the continental level, are clear examples of this approach that UNDP supports.

Turning to intra-African trade, which has recently received a boost through the **African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the significance of digital technology and innovation cannot be overstated. The AfCFTA represents a landmark agreement aimed at spurring economic integration and facilitating trade among African nations. By leveraging advanced digital platforms and innovative technologies, African countries can overcome traditional barriers to trade, enhance supply chain efficiency, and foster greater economic collaboration throughout the continent.**\n\nMoreover, harmonizing regulatory frameworks and standards across the continent will be critical in ensuring that digital innovations are interoperable and beneficial to all member states. This requires a concerted effort from governments to not only invest in necessary digital infrastructure but also to prioritize policies that support digital inclusivity and literacy.\n\nYet, the promise of digital transformation in Africa also brings inherent risks. Without adequate measures to secure data privacy, mitigate cyber threats, and ensure equitable access, the digital divide could exacerbate existing inequalities. Therefore, it is imperative that digital strategies are inclusive and accompanied by strong governance frameworks to protect the rights and interests of all citizens.\n\nUNDP is committed to working alongside African governments, the private sector, civil society, and international partners to build resilient and inclusive digital ecosystems. Our mandate includes supporting policies and programs that foster sustainable, inclusive growth and help African nations harness the power of digital innovations to meet their development goals.\n\nTo ensure that digital transformation translates into tangible benefits for all, we must mobilize resources, encourage public-private partnerships, and leverage the collective strengths of our diverse stakeholders. Through collaborative efforts and a shared vision for a prosperous, equitable, and sustainable future, Africa can unlock the vast potential of digital technologies to drive socio-economic development and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n**In conclusion, by embracing and effectively managing digital technology and innovation, Africa has a unique opportunity to leapfrog traditional development barriers and build a resilient, dynamic, and inclusive economy for future generations.**",

Training and re-skilling of the current workforce, particularly in digital literacy and emerging technologies, must also be prioritized to ensure that Africa's human capital is fully prepared to engage with and drive technological innovation.\n\nAdditionally, a conducive policy environment that encourages innovation and protects intellectual property rights can foster a thriving STI ecosystem. Governments should implement policies that incentivize research and development, reduce bureaucratic hurdles, and create a favorable landscape for startups and businesses centered around technology and innovation.\n\nThe private sector plays a pivotal role in translating technological and scientific advancements into practical applications that can drive economic growth and improve quality of life. Encouraging private sector investment in STI initiatives, through public-private partnerships, can ensure sustained funding and the scalability of successful projects.\n\nIn conclusion, Africa's path to achieving the SDGs and the aspirations of the AU 2063 Agenda is inextricably linked to effectively leveraging science, technology, and innovation. While there are significant challenges, there are also immense opportunities. By fostering a collaborative, inclusive, and strategic approach to STI, Africa can unlock its potential for transformative growth and development. The UNDP stands ready to support African nations in this journey and remains committed to being a trusted partner in their quest for sustainable prosperity.

The World Water Development Report 2020 sheds light on the impact of climate change on the availability, quality and quantity of water needed for basic human needs, thus undermining the basic rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for billions of people. Such a dire situation is exacerbated by unsustainable agricultural practices, industrial activities, population growth, and urbanization. The report emphasizes the urgent need to adopt sustainable water management practices to prevent further depletion of this critical resource.\n\nThe second report, \"Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain,\" provides a comprehensive analysis of groundwater resources in the region. It highlights the significant challenges posed by over-extraction, contamination, and the impacts of climate change. The findings underscore the importance of developing a robust Groundwater Management Plan to secure the long-term sustainability of water resources for agriculture, domestic use, and industrial activities in Pakistan.\n\nThe stakeholder consultation aimed to gather insights and recommendations from various experts, policymakers, and community representatives. Their inputs will be instrumental in shaping a strategic framework that addresses the complex challenges of groundwater management in Pakistan.\n\nUNESCO and its partners are committed to fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing to enhance water security and resilience. By implementing the recommendations from these reports, Pakistan can take significant strides towards ensuring the availability of safe and sustainable water resources for all its citizens, while also contributing to global efforts in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 \u2013 ensuring clean water and sanitation for all.",

As we seek to recover better together, we must make concerted efforts across the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2020-2030 to enhance the quality of life for older persons around the world. The Decade of Healthy Ageing serves as an unprecedented opportunity to bring together governments, civil society, international agencies, professionals, academia, the media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older people, their families, and communities.\n\nFirst, ensuring equitable access to health care is paramount. Health services must be accessible, affordable, and tailored to the needs of older individuals. This includes not just addressing physical health but also paying attention to mental health, which has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. Social isolation, bereavement, and anxiety have seen troubling increases, and we must provide the necessary support systems to mitigate these effects.\n\nSecond, the promotion of lifelong learning and employment opportunities for older persons can help combat ageism and enable them to contribute to their societies in meaningful ways. Education and job training programs should be designed to accommodate older workers, ensuring that they can remain active and engaged in their communities. \n\nThird, stronger social protection systems are critical. Pensions and other forms of social security must be sufficient to allow older individuals to live with dignity. Many older people face financial insecurity, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic due to job losses and economic downturns. Governments must ensure that social safety nets are robust and responsive to the needs of older persons, providing them with the resources necessary to navigate challenging times.\n\nWe must also recognize and support those who care for older persons. This includes both formal caregivers, such as nurses and midwives, and informal caregivers, such as family members. Caregiving can be physically and emotionally taxing, and caregivers deserve our respect and support. Training, fair wages, and mental health resources for caregivers are essential components of a robust support system.\n\nThe International Day of Older Persons reminds us of the invaluable contributions that older people make to society. Their wisdom, experience, and resilience are assets that benefit us all. As we move forward, we must ensure that our policies and practices reflect a commitment to inclusiveness and respect for all ages. We have the responsibility to create a world where everyone can age with dignity and with the opportunity to lead fulfilling lives.\n\nIn conclusion, as we commemorate this 30th anniversary, let us reaffirm our commitment to overcoming the challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and to building a more inclusive and supportive society for older persons. By addressing their health needs, promoting active participation, enhancing social protections, and valuing caregivers, we can vastly improve the quality of life for older individuals and, in turn, create a better, healthier, and more equitable world for all.",

Mr. Liu pointed out that while the coronavirus pandemic is having \u201cdevastating social and economic impacts\u201d across the world, women are fighting \u201con the front lines\u2026in healthcare settings, in home care, in the family and in the public sphere\u201d.

Moreover, he pointed out that women face reduced access to sexual and reproductive health services; and need more time to care for the elderly, sick and children, including home-based education; adding that they are also at higher risk of infection than men in the workplace. In terms of power and decision making, World\u2019s Women 2020 revealed that last year, women held only 28 per cent of managerial positions globally \u2013 almost the same proportion as in 1995. And only 18 per cent of enterprises surveyed had a female Chief Executive Officer in 2020. Timeliness and comparability of data over time and across countries, need to be improved -- Liu Zhenmin Among Fortune 500 corporate rankings, only 7.4 per cent, or 37 CEOs, were women. In political life, while women\u2019s representation in parliaments worldwide has more than doubled globally, it has yet to cross the 25 per cent barrier of seats and although representation among cabinet ministers has quadrupled over the last 25 years, it remains at 22 per cent, well below parity. Mr. Liu called on all countries to \u201caccelerate efforts\u201d in empowering women and girls, towards improving data gaps in covering key gender topics. \u201cTimeliness and comparability of data over time and across countries, need to be improved, and data disaggregation and dissemination by age, sex, location and other key variables, need to become a priority in order to fully measure and address intersecting inequalities, respond to crises, and ensure gender equality by 2030\u201d, he upheld.",

Additionally, wide gaps in the labor market persist, with women often relegated to lower-paying jobs and facing higher unemployment rates compared to their male counterparts.\n\nAs the pandemic's repercussions ripple across societies, the economic toll poses severe threats to gender equality. \"Pandemic-induced job losses, especially in sectors dominated by women such as hospitality and retail, are exacerbating existing gender disparities,\" noted Mr. Liu. The report calls for urgent, targeted policies to mitigate these impacts and foster an inclusive recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr. Guterres emphasized the need for continued commitment and action from all sectors. \"Governments, businesses, and civil societies must come together to support women's rights and empowerment.

It reveals that while there have been incremental improvements in areas such as girls\u2019 education, maternal health, and the reduction of early marriage rates, substantial gaps remain. In particular, women\u2019s participation in politics and leadership roles continues to lag significantly behind that of men.\n\nGender-based violence remains a pervasive issue, with millions of women and girls worldwide subjected to harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, forced marriages, and trafficking. Economic disparities also persist; women are more likely to work in informal and low-wage sectors, and they continue to earn less than men for the same work.\n\nMoreover, the report points out that the pandemic has disrupted efforts to close these gaps. Due to lockdowns and economic slowdowns, women are more likely to be pushed out of the workforce and less likely to have access to healthcare services, including reproductive health services. School closures have also increased the risk of girls dropping out permanently, which can have long-term effects on their futures.\n\n\"COVID-19 has been a stark reminder of the entrenched inequalities that women face,\" said Fleming. \"We must seize this moment to build back better, ensuring that women's rights are at the heart of recovery efforts.\" She called for renewed commitments from Member States and international organizations to prioritize gender equality in their policy responses.\n\nThe report underscores the importance of reliable data to monitor progress and inform policies. It calls for enhanced data collection and research to better understand the challenges women face and to develop effective strategies to address them.\n\nIn conclusion, the UN officials emphasized that achieving gender equality requires coordinated global action and unwavering political will. Reflecting on the 25 years since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, they urge Member States to accelerate their efforts and renew their commitment to ensuring that every woman and girl can live free from discrimination and violence, and have equal opportunities to succeed.\n\n\"Twenty-five years later, we must honor our commitments,\" Liu Zhenmin stated firmly. \"The future of our societies depends on it.\"",

One limiting factor is that the majority of seeds, and other input materials, come from outside, thus, farmers depend on imported seeds.

Agriculture in Armenia, especially the seed sector, is facing several challenges. The project addresses the most urgent ones, including the lack of national breeds resulting in the dependence on seed import, well-established and trustworthy seed and planting material certification scheme, access and knowledge of high quality and climate tolerant seeds and planting material for farmers, and low awareness on the importance of the management of plant genetic resources. Farmers often use their own seeds, which carry risks of uncertain production outcomes and disease vulnerabilities.

The project addresses the most urgent ones, including the lack of national breeds resulting in the dependence on seed import, well-established and trustworthy seed and planting material certification scheme, access and knowledge of high quality and climate tolerant seeds and planting material for farmers, and low awareness on the importance of the management of plant genetic resources. Farmers often use their own seeds, which carry risks of uncertain production outcomes and disease vulnerabilities. These issues contribute to the increase of the vulnerability of the country\u2019s agriculture to the climate change. \u201cMoreover, in the context of the COVID-19 era, implementation of the project is very relevant due to the project will support strengthening the national seed system as one of the main pillars of crop production and food security\u201d, added Raimund Jehle, FAO Representative to Armenia. This project is in line with the Government\u2019s recently approved strategy for sustainable agricultural development in Armenia; improving seed and planting material certification system is one of the prioritized actions there. The interventions will be integrated into the ongoing development actions to ensure the sustainability of the process beyond the project duration.

These constraints have significantly impacted their ability to contribute effectively toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially during the critical time of the pandemic response.\n\nTo address these issues, the Resident Coordinator highlighted the importance of creating an enabling environment for civil society organizations, emphasizing that their involvement and innovation are crucial in achieving the SDGs. This includes ensuring that these organizations can operate freely and securely, without undue constraints, thereby allowing them to continue their valuable contributions to society.\n\nFurthermore, in the meeting, the National SDG Coordinator and the Resident Coordinator discussed the alignment of the COVID-19 Social and Economic Response Plan with the broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They reviewed the plan's key components, which focus on protecting people\u2019s health and ensuring inclusive and sustainable economic recovery, while also targeting the most vulnerable populations including children and women.\n\nBoth parties acknowledged that the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and has posed significant challenges to the progress of the SDGs. They agreed that a concerted and coordinated effort is necessary to address these issues. The Resident Coordinator expressed the UN system's commitment to support Belarus in these challenging times through collaborative and inclusive approaches.\n\nThey also discussed strategies to strengthen communication and coordination between government agencies, UN bodies, and other stakeholders to ensure an effective and holistic response to the pandemic. This includes leveraging the expertise and resources of different partners to maximize impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the Resident Coordinator reiterated the UN's ongoing commitment to work closely with Belarusian authorities, civil society, and international partners to support the country\u2019s efforts in responding to COVID-19, while ensuring that the sustainable development agenda remains on track. The continued dedication to partnership, resource mobilization, and the protection of civil society\u2019s space were underscored as vital components for the success of these initiatives.",

            "ratio_2/3": "Today, Ethiopia joins the rest of the world in commemorating the Menstrual Hygiene Day under the theme, \u201cPeriods in Pandemic \u2013 it is time to take action!\u201d The objective this year is to emphasize the importance of continuing menstrual hygiene awareness and support for women and girls during COVID-19, especially for those living in poverty, the internally displaced, refugees, and those in quarantine and transit centers. A pandemic such as COVID-19 doesn\u2019t stop activities to support the basic menstrual hygiene needs of women and girls, including those who are on the frontlines of the pandemic. It is imperative that girls and women living in poverty, the internally displaced, refugees, and those in quarantine and transit centers are provided with menstrual hygiene kits. This is part of preserving their dignity amidst the difficult conditions they are living in. \u201cGiven the multiple challenges that women and adolescent girls face, it is evident that promoting menstrual hygiene management is not only a health and sanitation matter, it is also a crucial step towards safeguarding the dignity, integrity and overall life opportunities for women and girls,\u201d says Minister of Health Dr. Lia Tadesse. Since 2016, the Federal Ministry of Health, together with government and civil society partners, has been implementing a comprehensive menstrual hygiene and health programme in the country. The programme includes raising awareness in schools and surrounding communities to reduce stigma around menstruation, providing appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, as well as distributing menstrual hygiene materials to those in need. This integrated approach underscores the Ethiopian government\u2019s commitment to addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with menstrual hygiene management, especially in the context of a global pandemic.\n\nFurthermore, the programme\u2019s expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly significant. While the virus has disrupted many aspects of daily life, the needs of women and girls for adequate menstrual hygiene management have not diminished. In fact, the pandemic has exacerbated these needs, making it even more critical to ensure consistent and reliable access to menstrual hygiene products and facilities.\n\nOne of the key initiatives under this programme is the dissemination of menstrual hygiene kits. Each kit contains reusable sanitary pads, soap, hand sanitizers, and educational materials on menstrual health. This initiative is strategically targeted towards vulnerable groups, including those in poverty-stricken areas, internally displaced populations, refugees, and women and girls in quarantine or transit centers. The distribution of these kits is essential not only for maintaining hygiene but also for upholding the dignity and self-esteem of those affected.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Ministry of Health, in cooperation with partners, is implementing training sessions for health workers, teachers, and community leaders to foster a more supportive environment. These sessions focus on various aspects of menstrual hygiene management, including breaking taboos, understanding the health implications of poor menstrual hygiene, and promoting gender equality.\n\nMinister of Health Dr. Lia Tadesse emphasizes, \u201cThe role of our community and educational leaders is pivotal in transforming societal attitudes towards menstruation. By equipping them with the right knowledge and tools, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all women and girls.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry also leverages media platforms and technology to disseminate information widely. Radio programs, television segments, and social media campaigns have been rolled out to educate the public and normalize discussions around menstrual health.\n\nDr. Tadesse further highlights the economic implications of menstrual hygiene. \u201cWhen women and girls are able to manage their menstruation with dignity, it contributes positively to their productivity and participation in education, the workforce, and community activities. This is not just a health issue; it is also an economic and social development issue.\u201d\n\nThe efforts to improve menstrual hygiene management are part of a broader strategy to enhance reproductive health services and the overall well-being of women and girls in Ethiopia. The Ministry of Health's initiatives demonstrate a commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women, recognizing that menstrual hygiene is integral to these goals.\n\nAs Ethiopia joins the global community in celebrating Menstrual Hygiene Day, the message is clear: it is time to take action. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgency of supporting women and girls in managing their menstrual health with dignity. By continuing to invest in menstrual hygiene management, Ethiopia reiterates its dedication to upholding the rights and health of women and girls, ensuring that no one is left behind, even amidst a global crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the observance of Menstrual Hygiene Day in Ethiopia under the theme \u201cPeriods in Pandemic \u2013 it is time to take action!\u201d serves as a timely reminder of the ongoing challenges and the collective responsibility to address them. Through concerted efforts by the government, civil society, and communities, significant strides can be made towards ensuring menstrual hygiene for all, thereby fostering a healthier, more equitable society.",

The MOU aims to strengthen the cooperation between UN-Habitat and Ministry of Justice through joint efforts to secure and protect land tenure rights, and to facilitate the registration of ownership rights as one of the most critical durable solutions for Yazidis in Sinjar district. Additionally, the MOU strives to seek and explore potential solutions and legal approaches with respect to ownership rights and documentation, and remedy the effects resulting from the destruction of documents in the city of Mosul. Yazidis in Sinjar area face major challenges in proving their ownership or occupancy land rights, particularly where official documents are missing, damaged, destroyed, or in the absence of cadastral and registry information and maps delineating land and property to prove ownership or occupancy rights. Addressing and resolving Yazidi land rights would mark a major step towards respecting human rights and reconciliation. UN-Habitat has been addressing land rights of Yazidi minorities in Sinjar area since 2016, immediately after the area was liberated from ISIL. The agency is implementing a programme titled \u201cSupport to Housing, Land and Property Rights for IDPs in Nineveh\u201d which aims to facilitate the sustainable return and focuses on vulnerable IDPs from minorities (Yazidis) whose access to Housing, Land and Property (HLP) rights has been denied for decades by a legacy of discriminatory policies and practices against Yazidis, as well as by recent violent conflict. UN-Habitat is registering and mapping land claims by Yazidi returnees, supporting the verification of their claim among themselves, and issuing \u201cOccupancy Certificates\u201d that are endorsed by local authorities and community representatives. The issuance of occupancy certificates by UN-Habitat is a first step toward the final registration of Yazidis land rights in Iraq. More than 7,600 Occupancy Certificates have been distributed to Yazidis returnees so far, recognizing their occupancy rights for the first time in modern history. UN-Habitat is also liaising closely with the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the Iraqi Ministry of Justice to endorse a legal decree to formalize the recognition of land rights and upgrade the occupancy certificates to full \u201cLand Ownership Titles\u201d. Mr. Ahmed Luebi, Director General of the Department for Justice Affairs in the Ministry of Justice, stated that the signing of the MOU with UN-Habitat is necessary to ensure the sustainable return of the displaced people and the right of Yazidis to own land in Sinjar, which is considered one of the most important areas in Iraq. Further, he outlined that the MOU was drafted with the support of Prime Minister and the efforts of the Minister of Justice, Judge Salar Abdul Sattar Muhammed. Wael Al-Ashhab, Head of UN-Habitat Iraq, emphasized that the signing of MOU is as result of great collaboration with Ministry of Justice which is our main counterpart in our journey to facilitate the registration of Yazidis land rights.

Significant increases in COVID-19 cases have been reported from Libya, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Tunisia. Lebanon and Morocco have also started to see a rise in cases, with an exponential increase expected in these 2 countries in the coming weeks. \u201cWe are reaching a critical point for COVID-19 in our Region,\u201d said Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. \u201cJust one week after reaching the grim milestone of 11 million cases, we are now seeing an upward spike in a number of countries. This is being aggravated by new variants circulating \u2013 most concerningly the Delta variant \u2013 low vaccine availability and uptake, and lack of adherence to public health and social measures.\u201d With the Eid al-Adha feast taking place during the week starting 20 July, traditionally marked by religious and social gatherings, WHO is concerned that the current upsurge may continue to peak in the coming weeks, with catastrophic consequences. \u201cCountries are reintroducing or strengthening social and travel restrictions, but at this stage, increasing complacency by communities means that the virus is winning in the Region. \u201cAs variants continue to spread, we need everyone to get vaccinated as soon as they are offered the vaccine, and to continue wearing masks, and practising physical distancing. Although significant progress has been made, there remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines, and this leaves millions of people exposed to deadly variants of concern. It is not too late to turn the course of this pandemic, but it requires much more exerted global, regional and national efforts,\u201d said Dr Al-Mandhari. The total number of cases across the Region now exceeds 11.4 million, and the number of deaths is more than 223 000, with 19 out of 22 countries now reporting at least one new variant circulating. Tunisia reports the highest COVID-19 mortality rate of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and the African continent. The situation in the country continues to be extremely concerning. Between 8000 and 9500 cases are currently being reported every day, with wide circulation of the Delta variant. In less than one week, the number of deaths almost doubled, from 119 deaths on 5 July to 189 deaths on 8 July. Vaccine coverage is increasing, especially among people older than 60, but coverage is still low, with 12.7% of the population receiving at least one dose of vaccine, and 6% fully vaccinated. Public health measures have been strengthened, including suspension of social events and closures of businesses. Full lockdown is being implemented in some governorates, but the impact of these measures on the circulation of the virus and daily incidence needs to be strictly monitored. Oxygen beds are at 90% occupancy and intensive care unit beds are at 95% occupancy. In some governorates, hospital beds are over capacity. Hospitals are overwhelmed with limited numbers of available beds, and risk of shortage of oxygen supply. They also suffer from limited human resources, with medical staff very dedicated, but exhausted. Support to Tunisia has been remarkable, with countries in the Region and beyond stepping up to deliver field hospitals, medical equipment and oxygen cylinders, and additional vaccines, highlighting the spirit of solidarity and action within the Regional 2023 Vision of Health for All by All. WHO, like other international partners, is committed to supporting Tunisia in facing this crisis, including by procuring additional oxygen concentrators and generators to hospitals, as well as medical supplies, tests, reagents and PPE, and supporting provision of additional vaccines. Through the Emergency Medical Teams Initiative, WHO is also reaching out to its network partners for the possible deployment of international emergency medical teams to provide surge support in the areas of intensive and critical care, infection control and infectious diseases. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the number of cases has been increasing since mid-June. The daily average almost doubled during the past 4 weeks, increasing from 8539 on week of 6 June to 16 393 on week of 4 July. After 8 weeks of continuous decline, the number of deaths also increased during the past 2 weeks. Officials have blamed the surge on mass gatherings and travel during Nowruz, the country\u2019s biggest holiday which took place in late March, saying that compliance with health measures like social distancing and mask-wearing noticeably plummeted over the holiday. In Iraq, cases have been increasing since the end of May with the daily average doubling during the past 5 weeks, increasing from 4010 cases on week of 30 May to 8076 cases on week of 4 July. The number of deaths has also increased during the past 3 weeks. Less than one percent of the population received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Efforts by Iraq to contain the pandemic include banning government employees, students, and teachers from working unless they bring a vaccination document or a negative PCR test report on a weekly basis, and a countrywide partial curfew is being implemented. In Libya, a dramatic upsurge in cases starting on week of 4 July. The daily average of cases increased by 425%, from 246 cases on week of 20 June to 1293 cases on week of 4 July. Alfa and Beta variants of concern have been officially confirmed in the country, and the Delta variant is suspected to be circulating, given its presence in neighbouring countries. As a result, borders with Tunisia have been closed for one week. Vaccination coverage is still at a low level, with only 5.6% of the population partially vaccinated. Cases in Morocco have been steadily increasing since mid-May, with the daily average increasing from 170 cases on week of 9 May to 1066 cases on week of 4 July. Alpha and Delta variants of concern have been detected, causing Morocco\u2019s government to announce an extension of the state of emergency until 10 August.

In less than one week, the number of deaths almost doubled, from 119 deaths on 5 July to 189 deaths on 8 July. Vaccine coverage is increasing, especially among people older than 60, but coverage is still low, with 12.7% of the population receiving at least one dose of vaccine, and 6% fully vaccinated. Public health measures have been strengthened, including suspension of social events and closures of businesses. Full lockdown is being implemented in some governorates, but the impact of these measures on the circulation of the virus and daily incidence needs to be strictly monitored. Oxygen beds are at 90% occupancy and intensive care unit beds are at 95% occupancy. In some governorates, hospital beds are over capacity. Hospitals are overwhelmed with limited numbers of available beds, and risk of shortage of oxygen supply. They also suffer from limited human resources, with medical staff very dedicated, but exhausted. Support to Tunisia has been remarkable, with countries in the Region and beyond stepping up to deliver field hospitals, medical equipment and oxygen cylinders, and additional vaccines, highlighting the spirit of solidarity and action within the Regional 2023 Vision of Health for All by All. WHO, like other international partners, is committed to supporting Tunisia in facing this crisis, including by procuring additional oxygen concentrators and generators to hospitals, as well as medical supplies, tests, reagents and PPE, and supporting provision of additional vaccines. Through the Emergency Medical Teams Initiative, WHO is also reaching out to its network partners for the possible deployment of international emergency medical teams to provide surge support in the areas of intensive and critical care, infection control and infectious diseases. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the number of cases has been increasing since mid-June. The daily average almost doubled during the past 4 weeks, increasing from 8539 on week of 6 June to 16 393 on week of 4 July. After 8 weeks of continuous decline, the number of deaths also increased during the past 2 weeks. Officials have blamed the surge on mass gatherings and travel during Nowruz, the country\u2019s biggest holiday which took place in late March, saying that compliance with health measures like social distancing and mask-wearing noticeably plummeted over the holiday. In Iraq, cases have been increasing since the end of May with the daily average doubling during the past 5 weeks, increasing from 4010 cases on week of 30 May to 8076 cases on week of 4 July. The number of deaths has also increased during the past 3 weeks. Less than one percent of the population received one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Efforts by Iraq to contain the pandemic include banning government employees, students, and teachers from working unless they bring a vaccination document or a negative PCR test report on a weekly basis, and a countrywide partial curfew is being implemented. In Libya, a dramatic upsurge in cases starting on week of 4 July. The daily average of cases increased by 425%, from 246 cases on week of 20 June to 1293 cases on week of 4 July. Alfa and Beta variants of concern have been officially confirmed in the country, and the Delta variant is suspected to be circulating, given its presence in neighbouring countries. As a result, borders with Tunisia have been closed for one week. Vaccination coverage is still at a low level, with only 5.6% of the population partially vaccinated. Cases in Morocco have been steadily increasing since mid-May, with the daily average increasing from 170 cases on week of 9 May to 1066 cases on week of 4 July. Alpha and Delta variants of concern have been detected, causing Morocco\u2019s government to announce an extension of the state of emergency until 10 August. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.",

Although significant progress has been made, there remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines, and this leaves millions of people exposed to deadly variants of concern. It is not too late to turn the course of this pandemic, but it requires much more exerted global, regional and national efforts,\u201d said Dr Al-Mandhari. The total number of cases across the Region now exceeds 11.4 million, and the number of deaths is more than 223 000, with 19 out of 22 countries now reporting at least one new variant circulating.

The daily average almost doubled during the past 4 weeks, increasing from 8539 on week of 6 June on the week of 6 June to 16,084 in the first week of July. The Delta variant has been reported in 10 out of 31 provinces, contributing to a surge in hospitalizations and pressure on health services. Vaccination efforts are ongoing, but only around 4% of the population is fully vaccinated. Health authorities are enforcing stricter social and travel measures to mitigate the spread.\n\nIraq has also seen a sharp increase in cases, with between 7,000 and 9,000 cases reported daily in early July. The Delta variant is present and spreading rapidly. Like other countries in the region, Iraq is facing challenges with limited vaccine supply and low public adherence to health measures. The health system is under significant strain, with ICU capacity nearing full utilization.\n\nMorocco and Lebanon, while currently experiencing lower case numbers compared to Tunisia and Iran, are on the brink of a potential surge. Morocco has observed an increase in transmission following the easing of public health measures and increased movement during the summer. Lebanon's health system, already fragile due to the ongoing economic crisis, is preparing for an anticipated rise in cases.\n\nWith the approach of Eid al-Adha, WHO emphasizes the importance of adhering to health guidelines and maintaining public vigilance to avoid exacerbating the situation. \"Communities need to understand the critical role they play in curbing transmission. Personal and communal sacrifices during this festive period can significantly impact the trajectory of this pandemic,\" said Dr. Al-Mandhari.\n\nThe overall COVID-19 situation in the Eastern Mediterranean Region highlights the urgent need for equitable vaccine distribution and increased public health interventions. WHO urges countries and international organizations to support the region's efforts to curtail the pandemic. Enhanced vaccine procurement, healthcare infrastructure support, and community engagement are paramount to reversing current trends.\n\n\"Global solidarity and cooperation are crucial. We need to close the vaccine equity gap and ensure that all countries have the resources required to fight COVID-19 effectively,\" Dr. Al-Mandhari concluded.

Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, has raised concerns over the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases and fatalities recorded in the region, with Libya, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Tunisia experiencing significant surges. Lebanon and Morocco have also reported rises in cases, projecting an exponential increase in the upcoming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching a critical point for COVID-19 in our Region,\u201d Dr. Al-Mandhari stated. \u201cJust one week after reaching the grim milestone of 11 million cases, we are now witnessing an upward spike in several countries. This is being exacerbated by the spread of new variants \u2013 most notably the Delta variant \u2013 coupled with low vaccine availability and uptake, and insufficient adherence to public health and social measures.\u201d\n\nThis development is particularly concerning as it coincides with the Eid al-Adha feast, starting the week of 20 July. The holiday is traditionally marked by significant social and religious gatherings, raising the risk of further transmission. WHO warns that the current upsurge in cases may continue to peak in the subsequent weeks, potentially leading to devastating consequences.\n\n\u201cCountries are reintroducing or strengthening social and travel restrictions. However, increasing complacency in communities means that, at this stage, the virus seems to be gaining the upper hand in the Region,\u201d emphasized Dr. Al-Mandhari. \u201cWith the variants spreading, it is imperative that everyone gets vaccinated as soon as they are eligible, continues to wear masks, and practices physical distancing. Although we have made significant strides, a glaring imbalance persists in the global distribution of vaccines, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly variants of concern.\u201d\n\nThe overall number of COVID-19 cases in the Region now surpasses 11.4 million, with the death toll over 223,000. Alarmingly, 19 out of 22 countries in the Region are now reporting the presence of at least one new variant, underscoring the importance of vigilance and expedited vaccination efforts.\n\nIn Tunisia, the situation is particularly dire, with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the Region. Health systems are under extreme pressure, with hospitals facing shortages of beds, oxygen, and other critical supplies. The country's health infrastructure, already strained before the pandemic, is now on the brink of collapse.\n\nSimilarly, in Iran, the ongoing surge is overwhelming healthcare facilities. The country has recorded a marked increase in both cases and deaths, driven in part by the widespread transmission of the Delta variant. Efforts to vaccinate the population are hindered by limited vaccine supplies, exacerbating the crisis.\n\nIn Iraq, the health system has been stretched thin by successive waves of infections. The recent surge has led to renewed calls for public health measures to be strictly enforced. Meanwhile, vaccine hesitancy and logistical challenges continue to hamper vaccination efforts.\n\nLibya, still grappling with political instability, is facing one of its toughest public health challenges. The rise in cases has prompted authorities to impose strict measures to curb the spread, but compliance remains inconsistent.\n\nMorocco and Lebanon are also bracing for a sharp rise in cases. In Morocco, the government has put in place a series of measures aimed at containing the spread during the Eid celebrations. Lebanon, already in the throes of an economic crisis, is struggling to manage the rise in infections and ensure that the healthcare system does not become overwhelmed.\n\nDr. Al-Mandhari urged for collective action and solidarity to tackle the pandemic, emphasizing that both local and global cooperation are vital. \u201cIt is not too late to change the course of this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it requires concerted global, regional, and national efforts to enhance vaccine supply, ensure equitable distribution, and maintain public health and social measures.\u201d\n\nWHO remains committed to supporting countries in the Region through technical assistance, facilitating access to vaccines, and providing necessary resources to enhance health system responses. As the situation evolves, the global health body continues to advocate for international solidarity to manage and overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19.\n\nIn closing, Dr. Al-Mandhari stressed the critical need for adherence to public health guidelines and an accelerated vaccine rollout to stem the tide of rising cases. \u201cWith determined and united efforts, we can protect lives and livelihoods, and finally turn the tide against this relentless virus,\u201d he concluded.\n\n**For more information:**\nWHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean  \n[Contact Information]  \n[Website URL]  \n[Email Address]",

The United Nations in the Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the efforts of the Government of Kyrgyz Republic, civil society, academia, media, private sector and other stakeholders on promoting equality, preventing violence against women, and fostering the participation of women in public life and honoring the State\u2019s commitments to women and girls of Kyrgyzstan. The 2030 Agenda reaffirms that gender equality is an essential foundation for sustainable development in any country. Therefore the national development of the Kyrgyz Republic is directly related to how much Kyrgyzstani women are able to participate and to hold leadership positions in the society and economy.

The role of women in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kyrgyzstan has proven the same. Yet, women are still underrepresented in public life and decision-making. In addition to persisting social and systemic barriers to women's participation and leadership, the COVID-19 pandemic has created new barriers. Women face an increase in domestic violence, unpaid care responsibilities, unemployment and poverty, and women from some groups are affected more than the others. Although women make up the majority of frontline workers, there is a disproportionate and inadequate representation of women in national policy-making processes related to COVID-19.

The United Nations in the Kyrgyz Republic is proud to echo this theme and celebrate the incredible resilience, leadership, and innovations demonstrated by Kyrgyzstani women in these trying times.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and highlighted the critical importance of women\u2019s roles in communities, healthcare, and economic recovery. Women are not only at the frontlines as health workers and caregivers, but also as leaders and decision-makers who are steering us towards a more resilient and sustainable future. Yet, they continue to face significant barriers to engagement and leadership. In Kyrgyzstan, women represent a substantial portion of the healthcare workforce, and their contributions are paramount to the country\u2019s response to and recovery from COVID-19.\n\nHowever, the pandemic has also seen a rise in domestic violence and increased burdens of unpaid care work, both of which disproportionately affect women and girls. It is essential for the Government, with the support of international partners, to implement policies and initiatives that not only support the immediate needs of women but also address the systemic barriers to gender equality.\n\nPromoting women\u2019s leadership in both public and private sectors is vital for the accelerated achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Evidence shows that societies with greater gender equality experience faster economic growth and more sustainable development outcomes. In political life, women\u2019s leadership is associated with greater attention to social issues and inclusive policies. Thus, the increased representation and active participation of women in decision-making processes are imperative.\n\nTo this end, the Government of Kyrgyzstan has taken steps towards creating an enabling environment for women\u2019s leadership and participation. This includes legislative and policy measures to prevent violence against women, promote political engagement, and improve access to education and healthcare. Yet, much more needs to be done to close gender gaps and ensure that women and girls can thrive in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nOn this International Women\u2019s Day, the United Nations in the Kyrgyz Republic calls on all stakeholders to reaffirm their commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women. Let us work together to create a society where every woman and girl can realize her full potential, lead, and participate in decision-making processes in all areas of life.\n\nWe must all play our part to break down the barriers to gender equality and challenge the norms that perpetuate discrimination. Only by harnessing the collective strength of governments, civil society, the private sector, and the international community can we achieve the vision of the 2030 Agenda.

By spotlighting the legacy of a Black woman whose cells have played an unparalleled role in medical science, the WHO aims to tackle the enduring injustices that have hindered progress in health care access and treatment for women of color.\n\nHenrietta Lacks\u2019 family continues to be actively involved in public health advocacy, pushing for policies and practices that ensure fair access to life-saving medical treatments. They believe that honoring Henrietta's legacy involves more than just acknowledgment of past wrongs; it requires committed action towards a future where no woman's health is compromised due to her race or economic status.\n\nAs WHOs Global Strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer progresses, the agency pledges to take tangible steps to ensure HPV vaccines become more accessible in low and middle-income countries. Addressing supply constraints and reducing costs are essential measures that need urgent attention in order to protect the health of millions of girls globally.\n\nThe award given to Henrietta Lacks is more than a tribute to her; it is a call to rectify historical and ongoing disparities in medical science and health care.

Here is the continuation based on the initial details:\n\n---\n\n\u201cMy mother\u2019s contributions, once hidden, are now being rightfully honored,\u201d Mr. Lacks remarked. \u201cIt is a moment not just for our family but for every community that has ever felt the sting of scientific exploitation and racial injustice. Her legacy represents a powerful message of resilience and hope, showing what can be accomplished even when one\u2019s identity and contributions are initially disregarded.\u201d\n\nHenrietta Lacks' HeLa cells, named using the first two letters of her first and last names, have been instrumental in numerous scientific milestones since they were first cultured over 70 years ago. Unlike normal cells, which typically die after a few divisions, HeLa cells continue to grow and divide indefinitely under the right conditions, providing an endless supply for research. This unique property made them invaluable for scientific studies, leading to significant advancements in medicine and biology.\n\nThe human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, which have drastically reduced the incidence of cervical cancer worldwide, were developed using HeLa cells. These cells also played a crucial role in the development of the polio vaccine, which has saved millions of lives since its introduction in the 1950s. Furthermore, HeLa cells have been used in studies to develop drugs for HIV treatment, and they continue to contribute to ongoing cancer and COVID-19 research.\n\nDespite these monumental contributions, Henrietta Lacks\u2019 story was shrouded in secrecy for decades. The ethical breaches surrounding the use of her cells are part of a broader history where marginalized communities have been exploited in the name of scientific progress. By awarding this special recognition, WHO hopes to highlight the need for ethical standards that ensure consent and transparency in medical research.\n\nIn his address, Dr. Tedros emphasized the broader implications of honoring Henrietta Lacks. \u201cThis recognition is not just about the past\u2014it\u2019s about shaping a future where everybody\u2019s contributions are acknowledged and respected, regardless of their background. It is our collective responsibility to uplift those who were previously sidelined and to establish frameworks that prevent such injustices from happening again.\u201d\n\nThe award ceremony was a poignant moment for Henrietta Lacks\u2019 family, who have long advocated for recognition and ethical reform in medical research. For years, the Lacks family received no financial compensation from the extensive use of HeLa cells. This recognition by the WHO is seen as a step towards redressing historical injustices and ensuring that future research is conducted with integrity and respect for donor rights.\n\nSeveral health professionals and ethicists also commented on the significance of the award. \u201cHenrietta Lacks\u2019 cells have been at the cornerstone of many medical breakthroughs, and yet, her story reminds us of the human side of scientific advancement,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Cooper, a leading public health expert. \u201cThis recognition serves as a rallying call to the scientific community to uphold the highest ethical standards and to ensure that the benefits of research are equitably shared.\u201d\n\nThe WHO\u2019s initiative is part of a larger movement within the scientific community to recognize the contributions of people of color who have historically been overlooked or exploited. It underscores the importance of diversity and inclusion in research, aiming to pave the way for a future where every individual\u2019s contributions are valued.\n\nAs the ceremony concluded, there was a shared sense of commitment to carrying forward the legacy of Henrietta Lacks. Mr. Lacks and his family expressed their hope that this recognition would inspire continued dialogue and action towards equity in health and science. \u201cMy mother's legacy is a testament to the enduring impact one life can have. We are here to ensure that her story continues to illuminate the path towards justice and equity in the scientific community,\u201d he said.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s acknowledgment of Henrietta Lacks is a somber reminder of past injustices and a hopeful beacon for ongoing and future endeavors in medical research. Through honoring her, the organization reiterates its commitment to ethical standards, consent, and the empowerment of all communities in the pursuit of scientific knowledge.",

To address this, recommendations for breaking up long periods of inactivity with intervals of movement are made.\n\nFor adults, the focus is on moderate-to-vigorous activities that elevate heart rate and induce sweating. Examples include brisk walking, cycling, and swimming. For children and adolescents, the goal is to ensure a mix of aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening activities. Dancing, playing sports, and climbing playground equipment are practical ways to reach these activity levels.\n\nPregnant and postpartum women are advised to engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activities which can ease back pain, reduce the risk of gestational diabetes, and improve overall mental health. Adaptations to exercises may be necessary as the pregnancy progresses and after childbirth.\n\nPeople living with chronic conditions or disabilities can also greatly benefit from regular physical activity. Inclusive fitness programs that cater to varying abilities can facilitate this demographic's participation in regular exercise, thereby improving their overall health and wellbeing.\n\nOlder adults should particularly focus on activities that enhance balance and muscle strength to prevent falls and maintain functional independence. These could include tai chi, yoga, and pilates, in addition to other strength-training exercises.\n\nWHO hopes these updated guidelines will encourage more societies to promote physical activity, ultimately reducing the global burden of non-communicable diseases and enhancing the longevity and quality of life for all populations. The call to action is urgent: every move counts and making these guidelines a part of daily life can lead to profound health improvements worldwide.",
            "ratio_3/3": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced new guidelines advocating for 150-300 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week for adults and 60 minutes of daily activity for children. These recommendations underscore the substantial health advantages of regular exercise, which are particularly crucial during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO emphasizes that increasing physical activity is essential to combat the sedentary lifestyles that have become more prevalent."

In addition to equipping facilities and training healthcare providers, this project aligns with the broader objectives of universal health coverage and sustainable development. By integrating telemedicine and digital health services into the primary healthcare system, the initiative will address the challenges posed by geographical barriers, ensuring that even the most remote and underserved populations of Georgia have timely access to essential medical services. This technological advancement not only aims at managing the immediate impacts of COVID-19 but also at creating a resilient healthcare infrastructure capable of addressing future public health emergencies.\n\nMoreover, the project will foster collaborations with local stakeholders, including community health workers and local governments, to tailor solutions that best meet the needs of various regions. By leveraging digital platforms, patients will be able to receive consultations, follow-up care, and even mental health support without leaving their communities. This decentralized approach minimizes the risk of virus transmission and eases the burden on urban healthcare facilities.\n\nImportantly, the initiative also emphasizes the importance of public awareness and education about the benefits of digital health. Campaigns and community outreach programs will be employed to promote the acceptance and uptake of telehealth services among the general population. This includes addressing potential concerns regarding patient confidentiality and the quality of care delivered through digital means.\n\nIn conclusion, the EU-UN funded digital health project is poised to transform the healthcare landscape in Georgia, enhancing the quality and accessibility of healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. By building a robust telemedicine framework and upskilling healthcare providers, this initiative represents a significant step towards a more equitable and efficient healthcare system.

This is especially important for those living in remote areas, where access to healthcare can be limited.\n\n2. **Capacity Building:**\n   Training healthcare providers is another essential aspect of the project. Online training programs will be developed and provided to medical professionals across Georgia. These programs are designed to enhance their skills and knowledge in primary health care, incorporating the latest best practices and international standards. This will ensure that health professionals are well-equipped to handle a wide range of medical issues, not only COVID-19 but also other chronic conditions.\n\n3. **Community Engagement:**\n   In addition to equipment and training, the project also emphasizes the need for robust community engagement and awareness campaigns. By educating the public about the benefits of telehealth and the importance of preventive care, this initiative aims to foster a more health-conscious society. Community health workers will be trained to support these efforts, offering guidance and information to residents in rural areas.\n\n4. **Sustainability and Innovation:**\n   The project is designed with sustainability in mind, ensuring that the benefits extend far beyond the immediate challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The introduction of digital health solutions will pave the way for ongoing innovations in the healthcare sector. Continuous assessment and feedback mechanisms will be put in place to monitor the project's progress and make necessary adjustments.\n\nThe collaborative efforts of the EU and the four UN agencies\u2014WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, and UNOPS\u2014ensure a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. WHO will provide technical assistance and guidelines on best practices for telemedicine; UNFPA will focus on reproductive health services; UNICEF will ensure that child health services remain uninterrupted, and UNOPS will oversee the procurement and distribution of the necessary equipment.\n\nDr. Nino Berdzuli, WHO Representative in Georgia, highlighted the importance of this initiative, stating, \u201cTelehealth is the future of healthcare. By integrating these digital solutions into our healthcare system, we are not only responding to the current crisis but also building a resilient system that can withstand future health challenges.\u201d\n\nThe project's rollout began at the Mukhrovani Ambulatory, symbolically chosen for its representation of rural healthcare facilities across Georgia. Through this initiative, the beneficiaries will range from the elderly managing chronic conditions to children requiring routine vaccinations and check-ups.\n\nIn conclusion, this joint EU-UN project signifies a noteworthy leap towards transforming Georgian healthcare, particularly for those in rural communities. The project's success depends heavily on the dedicated involvement of health workers, local authorities, and the communities themselves.\n\nBy leveraging telemedicine and prioritizing capacity building, this project aims to create a lasting impact, ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare for all Georgians, especially in times of crisis like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As this project progresses, continuous efforts and collaborations will be necessary to adapt to emerging health care needs and to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nFor more information on this project or to get involved, please contact the ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia, or visit our partner organizations' websites for further details.",

The theme this year is, Zero Separation Act now! Keep parents and babies born too soon together. In Pakistan, where preterm birth is one of the three leading causes for neonatal mortality and accounts for more than one third of all deaths in newborns, UNICEF is collaborating with the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination and provincial health departments to established Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units in health facilities across the country to save lives of children born too soon. KMC is one of the best options to provide care for babies born before time in low and middle-income countries. \u201cScaling up Kangaroo Mother Care in health facilities across Pakistan, is a cost-effective intervention to save preterm infants,\u201d said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. \u201cIntroduced in Pakistan by UNICEF a few years back, KMC has become increasingly popular with health professionals caring for children born before time. The essence of KMC is to keep parents and babies born before time, together as against the past practice of separating small and sick babies from their mothers. The physical and emotional closeness of baby and parents during birth, delivery and hospitalization has long-term health benefits for the child. Additional care during pregnancy, complete antenatal care, nutritious food, mental and psychosocial support to pregnant women and birth spacing can reduce premature births,\u201d Ms. Girma added. In KMC, newborn is held closely to the chest by the parent, mother or father, with a blanket wrapped around both. The skin-to-skin contact provides warmth and prevents hyperthermia. It is medically beneficial for the baby and good for parent-child bonding. So far, 30 KMC units have been established in Pakistan with support from UNICEF and other development partners for round the clock service delivery. UNICEF has provided all the necessary equipment and materials to help establish 24 units in various public health centres - 16 in Punjab, 4 in Sindh, 1 in KP, 1 in AJK and 2 in Islamabad Capital Territory. It is collaborating with the Government to scale up KMC unites across the country. Government of Pakistan and its development partners are trying to reduce preterm births and newborn mortality due to related complications such as Birth Asphyxia, Prematurity and Sepsis. These efforts have helped reduce newborn mortality from 55 to 42 deaths per 1,000 live births during the last five years. It has also had a remarkable impact on morbidity in preterm newborns. The most vulnerable newborns are those born in marginalized groups, rural areas, urban slum environments and humanitarian settings. UNICEF emphasises that the reduction in premature births and newborn deaths can be achieved by strengthening health policies and services with focus on maternal nutrition and improving access and care for mothers and new-borns, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Globally, preterm birth is one of the leading causes of child deaths under age 5 as almost 15 million babies in the world are born prematurely and nearly 1 million die due to related complications. Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. Small and sick newborns, most of whom are born preterm, have the highest risk of death and contribute to the majority of the world\u2019s disabled children. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective and basic care, e.g. warmth, breastfeeding support, basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.

Small and sick newborns, most of whom are born preterm, have the highest risk of death and contribute to the majority of the world\u2019s disabled children. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective and basic care, e.g. warmth, breastfeeding support, basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.

The theme this year is, Zero Separation Act now! Keep parents and babies born too soon together. In Pakistan, where preterm birth is one of the three leading causes for neonatal mortality and accounts for more than one third of all deaths in newborns, UNICEF is collaborating with the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination and provincial health departments to established Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units in health facilities across the country to save lives of children born too soon. KMC is one of the best options to provide care for babies born before time in low and middle-income countries. \u201cScaling up Kangaroo Mother Care in health facilities across Pakistan, is a cost-effective intervention to save preterm infants,\u201d said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. \u201cIntroduced in Pakistan by UNICEF a few years back, KMC has become increasingly popular with health professionals caring for children born before time. The essence of KMC is to keep parents and babies born before time, together as against the past practice of separating small and sick babies from their mothers. The physical and emotional closeness of baby and parents during birth, delivery and hospitalization has long-term health benefits for the child. Additional care during pregnancy, complete antenatal care, nutritious food, mental and psychosocial support to pregnant women and birth spacing can reduce premature births,\u201d Ms. Girma added. In KMC, newborn is held closely to the chest by the parent, mother or father, with a blanket wrapped around both. The skin-to-skin contact provides warmth and prevents hyperthermia. It is medically beneficial for the baby and good for parent-child bonding. So far, 30 KMC units have been established in Pakistan with support from UNICEF and other development partners for round the clock service delivery. UNICEF has provided all the necessary equipment and materials to help establish 24 units in various public health centres - 16 in Punjab, 4 in Sindh, 1 in KP, 1 in AJK and 2 in Islamabad Capital Territory. It is collaborating with the Government to scale up KMC unites across the country. Government of Pakistan and its development partners are trying to reduce preterm births and newborn mortality due to related complications such as Birth Asphyxia, Prematurity and Sepsis. These efforts have helped reduce newborn mortality from 55 to 42 deaths per 1000 live births between 2018 and 2021. However, neonatal mortality in Pakistan remains unacceptably high, requiring sustained and accelerated efforts from all stakeholders to reach the target of saving more lives.\n\nIn addition to scaling up KMC, UNICEF advocates for comprehensive maternal and neonatal care services that include improving healthcare infrastructure, training healthcare providers, and raising public awareness about preterm birth complications. Enhanced antenatal care and timely medical interventions are critical to addressing the health needs of premature babies and reducing neonatal deaths.\n\n\"Premature babies need delicate and specialized care to survive and thrive,\" said Dr. Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health. \"The Government of Pakistan is committed to expanding access to quality maternal and neonatal care services, and our partnership with UNICEF is instrumental in achieving that goal.\"\n\nFurthermore, UNICEF emphasizes the importance of community-based interventions to support pregnant women and new mothers. Educating families about the importance of prenatal check-ups, nutrition, and healthy practices can lead to better outcomes for both mothers and infants.\n\nAs World Prematurity Day is commemorated, UNICEF and its partners call on national and provincial authorities, healthcare professionals, and communities to unite in their efforts to prevent preterm births and ensure that every child in Pakistan has the best start in life. By promoting practices like Kangaroo Mother Care and enhancing healthcare services, we can work towards a future where no child dies from preventable causes.",

The essence of KMC is to maintain a close, continuous skin-to-skin contact between the mother and her newborn. This method helps in stabilizing the baby\u2019s heart rate, breathing, and body temperature, which are often irregular in preterm infants. Additionally, it promotes breastfeeding, which provides essential nutrients and antibodies crucial for the baby's growth and immune system development.\n\nWorld Prematurity Day serves as a reminder of the urgent need to address the challenges that preterm babies and their families face. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 15 million babies are born prematurely each year globally, and approximately one million of these infants do not survive. In Pakistan, nearly one in seven children is born preterm, underlining the gravity of the situation within the country.\n\n\u201cBy keeping mothers and their preterm babies together, we not only improve the survival rates but also enhance their emotional and psychological well-being,\u201d said Dr. Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health. \u201cThe government is committed to expanding KMC units and strengthening neonatal care services throughout Pakistan to ensure every child has the best start in life.\u201d\n\nUNICEF\u2019s commitment goes beyond just setting up KMC units. The organization is also involved in training healthcare workers, conducting community awareness programs, and improving the overall healthcare infrastructure to support these facilities. This comprehensive approach aims to build a sustainable healthcare model that can cater to premature infants and their families effectively.\n\nThe combined efforts of UNICEF, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination, and provincial health departments have already shown promising results. Several districts now report improved survival rates and better health outcomes for preterm babies, thanks to the implementation of KMC practices. However, there is still a considerable need for increased investment and attention to neonatal care to reach every corner of the country.\n\nParents of preterm babies have also shared positive experiences with KMC. Many report a strengthened bond with their infants and feel more confident in their ability to care for their fragile newborns. This personal touch is a cornerstone of KMC, emphasizing not just the physical but also the emotional and psychological support vital for both mother and child.\n\nOn this World Prematurity Day, UNICEF and its partners invite everyone\u2014healthcare providers, policymakers, and the public\u2014to recommit to the cause of neonatal health. By working together, we can ensure that preterm infants in Pakistan and around the world have a fighting chance to not only survive but thrive.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\nUNICEF Pakistan Communications\n[Contact Details]\n\nAbout UNICEF:\nUNICEF works in the world\u2019s toughest places to reach the most disadvantaged children and adolescents\u2014and to protect the rights of every child, everywhere. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we do whatever it takes to help children survive, thrive, and fulfill their potential, from early childhood through adolescence.

This initiative aims to enhance the survival rates and health outcomes for newborns through the promotion of KMC, a method that emphasizes skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their preterm infants.\n\nThe expansion of KMC facilities is expected to play a crucial role in mitigating the risks associated with preterm births, which are a leading cause of neonatal deaths. By fostering a supportive environment for KMC, the partnership seeks to ensure that more babies receive the life-saving benefits of this cost-effective and impactful care method.\n\nUNICEF's collaboration with the Pakistani government highlights a shared commitment to improving maternal and child health. Together, they will work towards implementing and scaling up KMC practices in health facilities nationwide, providing training for healthcare providers, and raising awareness about the importance of this method among parents and communities.\n\nThis joint effort underscores the importance of early intervention and maternal engagement in the care of vulnerable newborns, ultimately contributing to improved survival rates and better long-term health outcomes for children in Pakistan."

As of the end of 2020 the Kyrgyz Republic hosted 684 refugees and asylum seekers. Many but not all of them yet have access to medical care, including COVID-19 vaccination, education and work. UNHCR will continue supporting authorities and other partners to achieve a better inclusion of all refugees in healthcare, education, employment and social protection to enable them to fully contribute to the development of their host communities. \u201cIn 2021, we mark World Refugee Day amid a continuing pandemic, which has put a strain on health care, schools and our communities. But the pandemic has also taught us that we are stronger when we stand together. Given the chance to study and work, refugees will continue to contribute to a stronger, safer and more vibrant world,\u201d said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia. Despite the pandemic, the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people, according to UNHCR\u2019s latest annual Global Trends report released on 18 June. This is a further four per cent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019.

        "original": "INCLUDING HIV PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES IN PAKISTAN\u2019S ESSENTIAL PACKAGE OF HEALTH SERVICES: A PIONEERING INITIATIVE Islamabad, 9 December 2020: The Government of Pakistan has recently launched another landmark initiative, the Essential Package of Health Services\u2014its national version of universal health coverage. Universal health coverage is a globally promoted initiative and is in line with Pakistan\u2019s commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly target 3 on health for all and leaving no one behind. Prime Minister Imran Khan said: \u201cPakistan has adopted an essential list of health services, which, once implemented, will put into action a set of preventive and curative interventions without stigma, delivered at the primary and secondary levels, that directly impact upon the health of vulnerable populations and marginalized communities; will help to achieve our human development goals; and will reduce the burden of many diseases and conditions, including HIV and AIDS.\u201d The Essential Package of Health Services will benefit everyone, including the furthest marginalized populations in geographically far-flung areas, and will improve access to lifesaving and life-prolonging services. Pakistan has also recognized pro-poor health strategies for responding to the HIV epidemic and the need to significantly increase public-sector investment at the federal and provincial levels to enhance primary health-care services. This comprehensive package, which includes HIV prevention and treatment services, is a compelling vision of a future in which everyone, including people at the grassroots level, has access to health services that are responsive to their needs and are provided in a timely manner. Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, emphasized: \u201cThe provision of many health-promotive, preventive and curative services is effectively possible only if woven into the normal delivery of care at the primary level. HIV is not an exception, and its quality of care will benefit greatly once it is part of a universal package.\u201d The Essential Package of Health Services includes specific services for people living with or affected by HIV, including: The 90,000 community-based Lady Health Workers (LHW) all over the country mandated to provide primary, preventive, promotive and curative care services mainly in remote rural and urban slum communities will now play a stronger role in providing HIV education and referral services at the community level. Comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services will now be an integral part of LHW Programme, thus normalizing HIV and reducing HIV related stigma. In the long run, it is expected to increase the uptake of HIV services and improve the quality of lives of people living with and affected by HIV.

UNAIDS Country Director for Pakistan, Dr. Maria Elena Filio Borromeo, remarked: \u201cIntegrating HIV services into the Essential Package of Health Services signifies a paradigm shift in how Pakistan is addressing its health challenges. It is an inclusive, people-centered approach that brings critical services closer to those who need them most, fostering a healthier society.\u201d\n\nOne of the key components of this initiative is the enhancement of public-sector investment. By channeling more resources into the health sector at both federal and provincial levels, Pakistan aims to strengthen its entire healthcare infrastructure, particularly primary health care. This will ensure a more robust and resilient system capable of addressing a wide range of health issues, from common illnesses to chronic conditions like HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe initiative underscores Pakistan\u2019s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals and its determination to improve health outcomes for all its citizens. By providing equitable access to essential health services, including HIV prevention and treatment, the country is making significant strides towards better health and well-being for all its people, especially those who have been historically underserved.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of the Essential Package of Health Services marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan\u2019s health policy. It not only addresses existing healthcare disparities but also lays down a sustainable pathway for achieving universal health coverage, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, can access the healthcare they need.",

Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Health Services, Regulations, and Coordination, emphasized the significance of integrating HIV prevention and treatment into Pakistan's broader health strategy. He stated, \"HIV/AIDS remains a critical public health issue in Pakistan, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. By incorporating HIV services into the Essential Package of Health Services, we are ensuring that these individuals receive the care and support they need without stigma or discrimination.\"\n\nThe inclusion of HIV services in the Essential Package is a testament to Pakistan's commitment to taking a holistic approach to health care. This initiative not only addresses the medical aspects of HIV but also tackles the social determinants of health that exacerbate the epidemic. By promoting awareness, reducing stigma, and providing comprehensive care, Pakistan aims to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for individuals living with HIV.\n\nThe Essential Package of Health Services includes a range of interventions aimed at preventing the transmission of HIV and providing treatment and support to those already affected. These interventions include widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and harm reduction services for people who inject drugs. Additionally, the package encompasses comprehensive sexual education, condom distribution, and testing and counseling services to promote early diagnosis and treatment.\n\nKey stakeholders, including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, and community-based organizations, have expressed their support for this pioneering initiative. They recognize that the success of the Essential Package of Health Services depends on strong partnerships and collaboration across multiple sectors. \n\nDr. Maria Elena Filio-Borromeo, UNAIDS Country Director for Pakistan and Afghanistan, highlighted the global significance of Pakistan's initiative. \"By integrating HIV services into its Essential Package of Health Services, Pakistan is setting a precedent for other countries. This holistic approach ensures that no one is left behind and that everyone has equal access to essential health services, regardless of their social or economic status.\"\n\nOne of the major challenges in implementing such comprehensive health services is the logistical and financial constraints, especially in remote and underserved areas. To address these challenges, the government has laid out a framework for robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. These mechanisms will track the implementation process, identify gaps, and ensure that resources are efficiently utilized.\n\nIn addition, significant investments are being made in health infrastructure and workforce development. Training programs for healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and community health workers, are being intensified to ensure they are equipped with the knowledge and skills to deliver high-quality care. The expansion of telemedicine services is also being explored as a means to reach populations in remote areas effectively.\n\nCommunity engagement is another crucial aspect of this initiative. By involving local communities in the planning and implementation processes, the government aims to build trust and ensure that the services provided are culturally sensitive and locally relevant. Community health workers will play a vital role in bridging the gap between health services and the populations they serve, particularly in areas where access to healthcare remains a significant challenge.\n\nThe launch of the Essential Package of Health Services marks a significant milestone in Pakistan's journey towards universal health coverage. By prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalized populations, the government is making a bold statement about its commitment to health equity and social justice. With the support of national and international partners, and through sustained investment and innovation, Pakistan is poised to make substantial progress in improving the health and well-being of its people.\n\nAs Prime Minister Imran Khan aptly noted, this initiative is not just about providing health services; it is about building a healthier, more equitable society where every individual has the opportunity to thrive. The Essential Package of Health Services is a pioneering step towards achieving this vision and ensuring a healthier future for all Pakistanis.",

Volunteers are at the centre of the disaster risk reduction response in Cox\u2019s Bazar and are engaged in a wide range of mitigation activities in the camps and surrounding host communities. From providing early warning and rescuing persons from drowning to stabilizing slopes on the other hand, the risk reduction measures taken by the volunteers encompass a variety of critical activities. In the Cox\u2019s Bazar District, volunteers not only work on life-saving missions but also engage in longer-term efforts to bolster infrastructure and community resilience. They participate in constructing and reinforcing shelters, digging drainage channels to prevent flooding, and planting trees to stabilize the soil and reduce landslide risks. These efforts, supported by various NGOs and UN agencies, ensure that both refugees and host communities are better protected against the impacts of extreme weather conditions.\n\nOne of the key figures in this network of volunteers is Rahima, a Rohingya refugee who has been an active participant in disaster risk reduction initiatives since she arrived at the camp three years ago. \"I have seen the devastating effects of floods and storms,\" she says. \"By working together, we can make our community safer.\" Rahima and her fellow volunteers are trained in first aid, search and rescue, and early warning systems, which are crucial skills in a region that frequently faces natural disasters.\n\nThe collaborative approach in Cox\u2019s Bazar serves as a model for other vulnerable regions. By integrating refugee communities into disaster preparedness and response plans, the ISCG partners not only enhance community resilience but also foster social cohesion. This inclusive strategy ensures that everyone, regardless of their status, plays a part in safeguarding lives and livelihoods.\n\nThe impact of such initiatives is evident in the improved preparedness and response capabilities of the communities. Early warning systems have become more efficient, reducing the time needed to alert residents of impending disasters. This has resulted in fewer casualties and less damage to property. Additionally, the construction of more resilient infrastructures, such as elevated shelters and improved drainage systems, has significantly mitigated the effects of flooding and storms.\n\nAs Bangladesh continues to face the onslaught of climate-related events, it becomes increasingly evident that enhancing climate adaptation measures is not just an option but a necessity. The lessons learned from the 2020 monsoon floods underscore the urgent need for robust disaster risk reduction strategies. Governments, international organizations, and local communities must work hand-in-hand to develop and implement these strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction on 13 October serves as a poignant reminder of the critical importance of community-led disaster preparedness and response efforts. The experiences of those in Cox\u2019s Bazar highlight the effectiveness of volunteer-driven initiatives and the need for continued support and collaboration. As the climate crisis intensifies, let us commit to building more resilient communities by investing in comprehensive risk assessment, adaptive infrastructure, and inclusive disaster management strategies.

Both agencies are advising health workers and caregivers to observe health and safety measures against COVID-19 during the four-day campaign. This advice comes in the wake of efforts to curb the spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in the south and central parts of Somalia. The strain of polio that is in circulation is different from the wild poliovirus, recently declared as eradicated from Africa, but it can also put communities where not enough children have been vaccinated at risk and leave children paralyzed for life. The outbreak has paralyzed 19 children since late 2017. \u201cThe only way to stop such outbreaks from vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio, is to vaccinate every child every time immunization services are offered, either through routine programmes or through such mass campaigns. We all have a moral responsibility to reach and boost the immunity of every last child in Somalia. Owing to access, security and health-seeking behaviour, we are missing a large number of children every year, who are not receiving these life-saving vaccines,\u201d said Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik, WHO Representative for Somalia. During the ongoing campaign, 6 266 vaccinators in urban areas and 2 685 vaccinators in rural areas will be going from door to door to vaccinate 1.65 million children aged under five with oral polio vaccine. In efforts to reach every child possible, an additional 1 125 team supervisors will be visiting households in targeted areas. 3 390 community mobilizers, sensitizing target communities, will play a key role in helping families to understand, trust and accept vaccines. \u201cIt is critical that all routine immunizations continue, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Werner Schultink, UNICEF Representative for Somalia. \u201cThese vaccination drives will help prevent further outbreaks and will protect children from deadly diseases so they can survive and thrive.\u201d Before the campaign, polio health workers were trained and supplied with personal protective equipment, including face masks, soap and hand sanitizer, to keep them and communities safe from COVID-19. This campaign is the first step in a two-part effort to raise immunity levels among Somali children. Somalia\u2019s Government, WHO and UNICEF will conduct the second part of the campaign in October to continue to strengthen the immunity of Somali children. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to accept the vaccine when it is offered to give their children life-long protection against polio.

        "original": "As elsewhere in the world, women in Ukraine represent a large proportion of the agricultural labour force and the majority of food producers, and thus play key roles in managing natural resources and promoting the well-being of their families. To explore and analyse gender issues in agriculture and food security, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed the first Country Gender Assessment for Ukraine,. The report \u2013 part of FAO\u2019s Country Gender Assessment series, and whose full title is \u2018National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine)\u2019 \u2013 aims to serve policymakers and practitioners engaged in the formulation and implementation of agriculture policies and programmes, researchers and analysts, civil society actors, and other partners. The report acknowledges women\u2019s role in food systems and rural development, yet it also points out their unequal access to land and other assets and resources, which limits their economic opportunities and puts them at risk of being left behind. Based on these findings, the report provides recommendations on how to address gender inequalities for increased agricultural productivity and food security, and sustainable rural development. Greater agricultural productivity, food security and rural livelihoods, says the report, cannot be achieved without recognising the distinct and complementary roles of women and men, and ensuring social and economic equality for both groups. \u201cThe report contributes to the existing knowledge base about gender equality in the country, by bringing together gender statistics and experts\u2019 opinions, but also serving as an advocacy tool to provide greater visibility to rural women\u2019s contribution to agricultural productivity and food security,\u201d said Mara Lopes, FAO Ukraine Head of Office. \u201cWomen and girls are critical agents in the fight against rural poverty and food insecurity. Supporting them in reaching their full potential will enable agricultural and rural development processes to be more effective.\u201d \u201cThe FAO report on Gender, Agriculture and Rural Development is an in-depth and comprehensive document covering gender issues in the context of different areas of women's and men's lives, including participation in decision-making, freedom from violence, the impact of climate change, access to resources such as land, water energy, education, health and more,\u201d added Kateryna Levchenko, Government Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy. \u201cThis makes it a relevant source of information for all a wide range of users\u201d. However, the report finds that rural women in Ukraine are limited in their capacity to contribute to agricultural production and take advantage of new opportunities, being concentrated in informal jobs and overloaded by multiple responsibilities. These include unpaid informal work on family farms, daily housework, and caring for children and other family members. Despite the heavy workload, their effort is often invisible and receives little recognition or economic or social reward. \u201cSince the outbreak of COVID-19, many women across the region find themselves in an even more disadvantaged situation, as evidence points to increased rates of domestic violence and longer hours of care work due to the widespread closure of schools,\u201d said Dono Abdurazakova, FAO Senior Gender and Social Protection Advisor. \u201cRural women with disabilities, women from ethnic minority groups such as Roma women, women who have been internally displaced, and many more, suffer from multiple vulnerabilities.\u201d One in every six people employed in Ukraine works in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The report reveals that specific job types within that sector tend to fall into either \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale\u201d occupation categories. Men represent 71 percent of all formal employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, whereas women in the same sector tend to work informally. Women make up 56 percent of migrant labour in Ukraine as a whole, and 58 percent of migrant labour in rural areas. Men are more likely to migrate abroad, while women tend to migrate internally. Unsurprisingly, only 20 percent of farming enterprises in Ukraine are headed by women. What is perhaps more surprising is that women generally undertake manual labour, such as cultivation, planting, weeding, and harvesting perishable vegetables, berries and herbs. Men, meanwhile, tend to undertake mechanised work such as tilling, ploughing and planting fodder crops, harvesting grain and corn (with combine harvesters), and transporting products to markets. Men are more likely to engage in large-scale crop production (wheat, corn, sunflowers), while women typically focus on horticulture and herbs. The tendency towards distinct tasks is repeated within the livestock sector, with women active in dairy production and work associated with milking and care of cows, and men usually responsible for transportation and mechanised labour. The report also goes into some detail on food, health and nutrition, broken down by the female and male experience in Ukraine. In terms of life expectancy, Ukrainian women live on average 10 years longer than men, and that gap is even more pronounced in rural communities (76.2 years compared with 65.6 years for men in 2019). This is a pattern reflected across all post-Soviet countries. In Western Europe, by comparison, female life expectancy exceeds that of their male counterparts by just five years.

Despite the heavy workload, their effort is often invisible and receives little recognition or economic or social reward. \u201cSince the outbreak of COVID-19, many women across the region find themselves in an even more disadvantaged situation, as evidence points to increased rates of domestic violence and longer hours of care work due to the widespread closure of schools,\u201d said Dono Abdurazakova, FAO Senior Gender and Social Protection Advisor. \u201cRural women with disabilities, women from ethnic minority groups such as Roma women, women who have been internally displaced, and many more, suffer from multiple vulnerabilities.\u201d One in every six people employed in Ukraine works in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The report reveals that specific job types within that sector tend to fall into either \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale\u201d occupation categories. Men represent 71 percent of all formal employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, whereas women in the same sector tend to work informally. Women make up 56 percent of migrant labour in Ukraine as a whole, and 58 percent of migrant labour in rural areas. Men are more likely to migrate abroad, while women tend to migrate internally. Unsurprisingly, only 20 percent of farming enterprises in Ukraine are headed by women. What is perhaps more surprising is that women generally undertake manual labour, such as cultivation, planting, weeding, and harvesting perishable vegetables, berries and herbs. Men, meanwhile, tend to undertake mechanised work such as tilling, ploughing and planting fodder crops, harvesting grain and corn (with combine harvesters), and transporting products to markets. Men are more likely to engage in large-scale crop production (wheat, corn, sunflowers), while women typically focus on horticulture and herbs. The tendency towards distinct tasks is repeated within the livestock sector, with women active in dairy production and work associated with milking and care of cows, and men usually responsible for transportation and mechanised labour. The report also goes into some detail on food, health and nutrition, broken down by the female and male experience in Ukraine. In terms of life expectancy, Ukrainian women live on average 10 years longer than men, and that gap is even more pronounced in rural communities (76.2 years compared with 65.6 years for men in 2019). This is a pattern reflected across all post-Soviet countries. In Western Europe, by comparison, female life expectancy exceeds that of their male counterparts by just five years.

The report \u2013 part of FAO\u2019s Country Gender Assessment series, and whose full title is \u2018National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine)\u2019 \u2013 aims to serve policymakers and practitioners engaged in the formulation and implementation of agriculture policies and programmes, researchers and analysts, civil society actors, and other partners. The report acknowledges women\u2019s role in food systems and rural development, yet it also points out their unequal access to land and other assets and resources, which limits their economic opportunities and puts them at risk of being left behind. Based on these findings, the report provides recommendations on how to address gender inequalities for increased agricultural productivity and food security, and sustainable rural development. Greater agricultural productivity, food security and rural livelihoods, says the report, cannot be achieved without recognising the distinct and complementary roles of women and men, and ensuring social and economic equality for both groups. \u201cThe report contributes to the existing knowledge base about gender equality in the country, by bringing together gender statistics and experts\u2019 opinions, but also serving as an advocacy tool to provide greater visibility to rural women\u2019s contribution to agricultural productivity and food security,\u201d said Mara Lopes, FAO Ukraine Head of Office. \u201cWomen and girls are critical agents in the fight against rural poverty and food insecurity. Supporting them in reaching their full potential will enable agricultural and rural development processes to be more effective.\u201d \u201cThe FAO report on Gender, Agriculture and Rural Development is an in-depth and comprehensive document covering gender issues in the context of different areas of women's and men's lives, including participation in decision-making, freedom from violence, the impact of climate change, access to resources such as land, water energy, education, health and more,\u201d added Kateryna Levchenko, Government Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy. \u201cThis makes it a relevant source of information for all a wide range of users\u201d. However, the report finds that rural women in Ukraine are limited in their capacity to contribute to agricultural production and take advantage of new opportunities, being concentrated in informal jobs and overloaded by multiple responsibilities.

Men represent 71 percent of all formal employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, whereas women in the same sector tend to work informally. Women make up 56 percent of migrant labour in Ukraine to provide a comprehensive understanding of gender dynamics in the agriculture sector in Ukraine.\n\nThe FAO report underscores the critical need for gender-sensitive policies to bridge the gaps women face in accessing education, technology, and capital. It stresses the importance of creating legal frameworks that ensure women's equal rights to land ownership and inheritance, as well as the need for targeted training programs that enhance women's skills and knowledge in agricultural practices and business management. Enhancing women's participation in decision-making processes at all levels\u2014from local to national\u2014is also highlighted as essential for fostering inclusive rural development.\n\nFurthermore, the report calls for better rural infrastructure and services that can alleviate the burden of unpaid care work on women. Improved access to childcare services, healthcare, and transport can play a significant role in enabling rural women to engage more actively in productive economic activities. The creation of social protection programs tailored to the needs of rural women can also provide them with the security needed to invest in their agricultural enterprises.\n\nAt the community level, challenging and changing social norms that perpetuate gender inequality is vital. The FAO recommends community-based interventions that promote gender equality and empower women, including campaigns that raise awareness about women's rights and the vital contributions they make to agricultural productivity and rural development.\n\nThe findings and recommendations of the National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine) are intended to inform and guide stakeholders in the agricultural sector, including governmental bodies, international organizations, and NGOs, in creating more equitable and sustainable agricultural systems.\n\nThe FAO's commitment to gender equality is reflected in its efforts to integrate a gender perspective in all its programs and policies. By addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by women in agriculture, Ukraine can make significant strides towards achieving food security, reducing rural poverty, and promoting sustainable rural development for all.\n\nThis report serves as a timely and necessary tool for advancing gender equality in Ukraine's agricultural sector, ensuring that women and men can contribute equally to, and benefit from, the country\u2019s development.",

Supporting them in reaching their full potential will enable agricultural and rural development to thrive,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Country Gender Assessment for Ukraine sheds light on the systemic challenges and barriers faced by women in agriculture. It highlights how the persistent gender gap in access to productive resources such as land, credit, extension services, technology, and markets curtails women's productivity and entrepreneurial potential. This gap makes it difficult for women to invest in and expand their agricultural activities, thereby limiting their income and well-being.\n\nThe assessment reveals striking disparities in land ownership, where women own significantly smaller plots compared to men, often resulting in lower yields and economic returns. Furthermore, women frequently face challenges in accessing credit facilities due to lack of collateral, which is typically tied to land ownership. Such financial barriers restrict their ability to purchase necessary inputs, invest in new technologies, and enhance the productivity of their farms.\n\nFAO's report also addresses issues related to women's representation in leadership and decision-making roles within rural and agricultural sectors. Despite their critical contributions, women remain underrepresented in local governance and agricultural cooperatives, limiting their influence over policy and resource allocation decisions. This underrepresentation undermines efforts to create gender-sensitive agricultural policies that cater to the unique needs of women farmers.\n\nTo combat these inequalities, the report outlines several key recommendations. First, there is a call for gender-sensitive land reform policies that ensure women's legal rights to land ownership and inheritance. This would involve providing legal assistance and raising awareness among women about their land rights. Additionally, enhancing access to credit and financial services through tailored financial products and services that cater to women farmers' specific needs is essential.\n\nInvestment in gender-responsive agricultural research and extension services is equally vital. By ensuring that women have access to appropriate technologies, information, and training, their productivity and innovation potential can be significantly boosted. Facilitating women's participation in agricultural cooperatives and leadership roles is also recommended to amplify their voices in decision-making processes.\n\nThe report emphasizes the importance of improving access to markets for women farmers. Developing women-friendly value chains and supporting women's entrepreneurial ventures in agriculture can enhance market opportunities. This could be achieved by creating women-led cooperatives, providing market information, and establishing linkages between women producers and buyers.\n\nFAO also stresses the need for integrating gender perspectives into climate change adaptation and resilience-building initiatives. Women are often disproportionately affected by climate change impacts due to their reliance on natural resources for livelihoods. Tailoring climate-smart agricultural practices and resilience strategies to address gender-specific vulnerabilities can ensure that both women and men benefit from sustainable agricultural development.\n\nFurthermore, the report highlights the role of social protection and labour policies in addressing rural women's vulnerabilities. Improving social safety nets, ensuring decent working conditions, and enhancing access to childcare and healthcare services can empower women to fully participate in agricultural activities without compromising their well-being.\n\nMs. Lopes concluded, \"Empowering women in agriculture is not only a matter of social justice but also an economic imperative. By addressing gender inequalities and creating an enabling environment for women farmers, we can unlock untapped potential in the agriculture sector, leading to greater food security and rural prosperity.\"\n\nThe National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods is a pivotal step toward more inclusive and equitable agricultural development in Ukraine. FAO pledges its continued support to the Ukrainian government and partners in implementing the report's recommendations, with the ultimate goal of achieving gender equality and enhancing the livelihoods of rural communities.\n\nThe report is available for download on the FAO website, providing a valuable resource for anyone interested in fostering gender equity in Ukraine\u2019s agricultural sector and beyond. Together, with concerted efforts and strategic partnerships, FAO envisions a future where women are fully recognized and supported as pivotal contributors to agricultural growth and rural development.",

COVID-19 is not just a pandemic that hit the health sector, but its consequences reached out to all aspects of our lives including the environmental sectors. The impact of the measures undertaken to mitigate the risks of the pandemic had dual effect on environment. The mandatory usage of facial masks, gloves and hand sanitizers resulted in generation of a massive amount of medical wastes in the environment. On the other hand, the gas emissions are getting lower since the suspension of flights and transport systems. Cristina Albertin (The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Egypt ad interim) stated that \u201cThe United Nations in Egypt is strongly committed to supporting Egypt in overcoming the challenges resulted from COVID-19 by putting the environmental sustainability and natural resource management among the priorities of its response and recovery plans.\u201d The core of these priorities is supporting national efforts to manage Egypt\u2019s natural resources, mitigate environmental hazards and foster a greener economy and society.

Pollution, loss of biodiversity, and climate change are underlying drivers of health risks and vulnerabilities. Therefore, as we rebuild from the devastation caused by COVID-19, it is critical that our strategies are sustainable and environmentally sound.\n\nWorld Environment Day serves as a reminder that the health of our planet is crucial for the survival of future generations. As we advance in our recovery efforts, let us seize this moment to advocate for and implement policies that nurture our environment, ensuring a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient world for all.\n\nThe collaboration of governments, industries, and communities in this endeavor is essential.

Only through determined and collaborative efforts can we ensure that the universal values of respect, equality, and dignity translate from paper into practice in every corner of the globe.\n\nGovernments, civil societies, and individuals all have a role to play. Governments must enact and enforce laws that protect human rights, hold violators accountable, and foster an environment where every individual can thrive without fear of oppression. Civil societies must remain vigilant, advocating for the marginalized and holding those in power to account. Each individual has a responsibility to combat prejudice in their own lives and support initiatives that promote an inclusive and equitable society.\n\nMoreover, the private sector must also shoulder responsibility in advancing human rights. Businesses and corporations wield significant influence and resources that can either bolster or undermine human rights efforts. By adopting ethical practices and promoting diversity and inclusion within their operations, companies can contribute meaningfully to social progress.\n\nIn the spirit of the UDHR, let us all pledge to work tirelessly to address human rights violations wherever they occur. Through solidarity, education, and action, we can transform the aspiration of universal human rights into lived reality for everyone.
