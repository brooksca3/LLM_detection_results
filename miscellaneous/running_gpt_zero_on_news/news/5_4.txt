Chace Crawford reveals he hooked up with a 'Gossip Girl' co-star: 'Those things are inevitable'

Chace Crawford is revealing how life started started imitating art during his "Gossip Girl" days in the mid-2000s to the early 2010s.

On Wednesday's "Call Her Daddy" episode, the Lubbock, Texas-born actor, 37, reminisced about how he started morphing into Upper East Side high schooler Nate Archibald – whom he portrayed on The CW show from 2007-2012 – while living and filming in New York City.

Crawford told host Alex Cooper that he and on-screen best friend Ed Westwick, aka blue blood bad boy Chuck Bass, lived together in "this little apartment" around 10th Avenue and 26th Street in the Chelsea neighborhood during their "Gossip Girl" days. They shared a junior one-bedroom, in which he lived in the main bedroom while Westwick took the extra space, which wasn't quite a full room.

He jokingly called his friend out for being a messy roommate and having "a lunch pail with overflowing cigarettes."

"You (would have) thought the Joker lived there; it was insane. I'm not even kidding," Crawford said, noting that Westwick was 18 or 19 while he was 21 years old at the time. "I shouldn't be calling him out like this, but I love him to death."

"We had an absolute blast in that place. We had a rooftop deck," Crawford added. "He'd invite a bunch of people; we'd bring a Bose speaker and a big bottle of vodka and just have a party up there all the time. ... We'd bring good friends. But then sometimes it'd get really out of hand."

Some of the guests they'd hosted included Lindsay Lohan and Alex Pall, who went on to form The Chainsmokers with Drew Taggart, he said. And though he recalled that they'd "raged up there," the parties never got shut down.

Cooper asked whether these gatherings were like the parties their on-screen personas would throw. "Not much except the money involved," he said. "We didn't put much money behind ours. We weren't making quite that. ... They did turn out to be pretty fun, well known-parties."

Crawford also spilled on any on-set romances with any of his "Gossip Girl" coworkers.

"I would say those things are inevitable," he seemingly confirmed. "When you're in your 20s … the thing is you're on these things − people probably think it's like, these sexy scenes or whatever and that's like the worst part of it. It's, like, 60 people watching. (During the) downtime, you're doing this show; you're on set for, like 12-14 hours a day. And usually there's some pretty interesting people from all walks of life." The danger is if you connect right away with sense of humor, at least for me. If you have a rapport and can kind of, like, banter."

Crawford didn't kiss and tell: "I've done other shows and stuff" he said, trying to lead Cooper away from assuming he'd gotten involved with a "Gossip Girl" co-star.
