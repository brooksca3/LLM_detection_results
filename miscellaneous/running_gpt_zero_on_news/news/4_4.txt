Step aside, carriage scene — Luke Newton says there's plenty more where that came from.

The first half of Bridgerton season 3 culminated in a highly-anticipated — and not to mention steamy — hook-up between Colin Bridgerton (Netwon) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) in Penelope's carriage, and Newton tells PEOPLE there's even more to come.

"There's so much more to come in part 2," he says on the red carpet at the London premiere for part 2 on June 12, adding of the fans' response to the scene, "I think that's the best thing about the split release – is that people really appreciated the moments and went into detail with part one, which they might not have. They might have gotten lost in all the amazing scenes that we've got in part two."


Newton, 31, teases that "it gets steamier as we go on," so the fans response left him "blown away."

"It's amazing. The stuff I've seen online – the creativity behind people's ideas — it's just brilliant," he shares.

In a video for Netflix, Newton and his costar previously shared their reactions to the carriage scene, which ends with Colin asking for Penelope's hand in marriage — a moment she's been waiting for since Bridgerton's premiere.

Coughlan, 37, admitted that she and Newton felt "big pressure" when it came to filming the fan-favorite moment from the book, Julia Quinn's Romancing Mister Bridgerton.

“The fans are horny little devils and they used to send us pictures of carriages constantly and carriages rocking,” she said of the expectations for the scene. “So, this has to be both beautiful, touching, romantic and sexy, which is a lot of things.”

Newton previously told PEOPLE that he and Coughlan were striving to make things "really authentic" to their characters when it came to the intimate scenes.

"We just wanted to honor that because people have a lot of love for their relationship, and we wanted to keep it really true to that,” he said. "So we would have discussions about how their first encounter would be and what the intimacy would be like, and if it would be, and we talked to the intimacy coordinator even [about] the intensity of the scene.”

Coughlan added that "the intimacy stuff feels very real" this season.

“It feels very grounded in two people that are not trying to sort of, that they're awkward in front of one another, this and that, and all of a sudden they become like letharias in the bedroom and whatever, they get to be intimate together in a very real and beautiful way, and I think that's what makes it so affecting,” she said. “In those intimate moments, they find moments to laugh and you see them figuring it out and doing it together, and I love it.”
