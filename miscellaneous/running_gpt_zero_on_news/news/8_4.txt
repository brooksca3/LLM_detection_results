Looking to see some theater? Here are six recommended works running in the Washington area right now, with excerpts from our reviews.
‘Hair’


Set aside for a moment the macro-issue sociopolitical echoes that could maybe, if negotiated brilliantly, make a 2024 production of this Vietnam-era protest musical seem fresh as a flower in a reservist’s rifle barrel: I turned up for the opening of Signature Theatre’s staging just off a conversation with a teenage nephew whose hoop dreams seem to be fading and whose relationship just evaporated, which may be why the essential sweetness and fragility of “Hair’s” struggling individual adolescents is what registered most with me this time around.

Through July 7 at Signature Theatre in Arlington. About 2½ hours, including an intermission. sigtheatre.org.
‘Topdog/Underdog’


There’s sibling rivalry, and then there’s the pitched fraternal battle between Lincoln and Booth, the fatefully named brothers at the center of Suzan-Lori Parks’s devastating card-trick psychodrama. Had the playwright, who won the Pulitzer Prize for this deceptively rich two-hander, named her characters Cain and Abel, she would still have captured the tragic inevitability of the thing. But she wouldn’t have the recurring chord of cruel, fundamentally American absurdity that has made this Black hybrid of “Waiting for Godot” and “True West,” first performed in the summer of 2001, one of the most rightly celebrated plays of this young, bloody, cruel and absurd century.

Through June 23 at Round House Theatre in Bethesda. About 2½ hours, including an intermission. roundhousetheatre.org.
‘Problems Between Sisters’


Two siblings, one a diligent but unfussy artistic type and one verging on the criminally insane, occupy an older relative’s real estate as the former struggles to finish and sell a project — before personality clashes and the latter’s raw charisma upend the status quo and derail the creative process. If that sounds rather like Sam Shepard’s “True West,” it’s because Julia May Jonas’s “Problems Between Sisters” specifically appreciates and attacks that canonical drama, inverting and interrogating its distinctly toxic hypermasculine energy and reframing its events as a crisis between competitive sisters rather than competitive brothers.

Through June 16 at Studio Theatre in Washington. About 1 hour 40 minutes, including an intermission. studiotheatre.org.
‘Metamorphoses’

Tales of creation and re-creation are on voluptuous display in Mary Zimmerman’s play. Directed with ludic energy by Psalmayene 24, the “choreo-drama” never settles for a single, snowed-in sense of the title, but revels in instability and reversals. It’s also a marvelous palimpsest, revisioning the Tony-winning play, which opened on Broadway more than 20 years ago. Psalmayene 24 has said that his decision to cast the show with all-Black actors was precipitated by the police killing of Tyre Nichols. Read our review by Rhoda Feng.

Through June 23 at Folger Theatre in Washington. Approximately 90 minutes; no intermission. folger.edu.
‘Where the Mountain Meets the Sea’

It’s the silence that captures a fractured relationship’s unspeakable ache in playwright Jeff Augustin’s mournful, folk-music-infused play. As a Haitian immigrant and his college-bound son share a car ride, unable to admit even pride or appreciation for each other, the things left unsaid will burden them for years to come.

Through July 7 at Signature Theatre in Arlington. About 80 minutes; no intermission. sigtheatre.org.
‘Mexodus’


This thrilling, multicultural hip-hop history lesson at Mosaic Theater Company is performed by a mere duo, but their savvy use of samplers and other gear to record and instantly play back layer upon layer of vocal and instrumental sound is a force multiplier. That history concerns the less-publicized and less-traveled route of the underground railroad that ran south. An estimated 4,000 to 10,000 enslaved people fled the United States for Mexico between 1821, when Mexico won its independence from Spain, and 1865, when slavery was abolished in the forcibly re-United States.
