"Emotions are very heightened, so I know she'll come around when she's ready, but as of right now, I have not heard from her" Melanie Wilking tells PEOPLE


Melanie Wilking says she has not spoken with sister Miranda Derrick since the release of Dancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult.

Derrick, 27, is one of several popular TikTok dancers highlighted in the new Netflix docuseries, which alleges she and others are part of an alleged cult overseen by Robert Shinn, the founder of the Shekinah Church.

The TikTok star has pushed back against claims made by members of her family in the series, which she called “one-sided.”

Wilking exclusively tells PEOPLE she has “not heard from” Derrick since the release of the documentary, despite attempting to connect with her.

“I have reached out just saying, ‘I'm here whenever you're ready to talk.’ And I honestly was not expecting a response,” she says. “We're both going through a lot. Emotions are very heightened, so I know she'll come around when she's ready, but as of right now, I have not heard from her.”

Derrick has released multiple separate statements since the series’ premiere on May 29. In her first statement, shared Tuesday, June 4, the TikTok star said she and her family members “don't see eye to eye at this time.”

In another statement, shared Monday, June 10 on Instagram, Derrick claimed she and her husband James "BDash" Derrick received death threats and were stalked after the series became available on Netflix.

Wilking tells PEOPLE her family "never wanted any sort of violence to come her way.” 

“I'm very sorry that she has experienced that because our only intent was to save her from an unsafe environment and to give her love and know that we're here to support her,” she explains.

Derrick’s sister also believes the social media star’s statements make it “very clear” that she “did not watch the documentary."

“If she did, she would know that it's so much bigger than just our family situation and it goes deeper, 25-plus years of Robert controlling these people,” she tells PEOPLE.
