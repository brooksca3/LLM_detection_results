'I was in a loving and caring relationship with Paul Cavagnaro of North Greenbush,' Ryan confessed.

'He was the love of my life. We had 25 great years together. Paul died in 1994 from a medical Procedure gone wrong. I'll be buried next to Paul.'

The former soldier explained that he had never dared reveal his secret for fear of being disowned by those he knew and loved. 

'I'm sorry for not having the courage to come out as Gay. I was afraid of being ostracized: by Family, Friends, and Co-Workers,' he recalled.

'Seeing how people like me were treated, I just could not do it. Now that my secret is known, I'll forever Rest in Peace.'

Ryan served with the Army's 10th Brigade and received several military awards, including the National Defense Service Medal and the Defense of Liberty Medal 'for participation to the State following the attack on America, 11 September 2001,' per his his obituary.
