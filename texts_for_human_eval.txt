Baghdad, 20 December 2021 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Iraq welcomes an additional EUR 1.5 million (US$ 1.7 million) contribution from the Government of Finland to its flagship programme the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS). The critical support will bolster ongoing efforts to stabilize the five governorates liberated from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Since 2015, the FFS has supported over 3,000 projects, restoring essential services, supporting livelihoods, building municipal capacity and fostering cohesion in areas liberated from ISIL. “UNDP’s ability to deliver to the highest standard at speed and scale makes us the development partner of choice. This would not be possible without the continuous and generous support from international partners such as the Government of Finland,” says UNDP Resident Representative for Iraq, Zena Ali Ahmed. “However, critical stabilization needs remain as over 1 million people are still internally displaced, including the hardest-to-return populations. The Government of Finland’s contribution comes at an important time in Iraq’s recovery from years of conflict, as the country looks to safeguard the hard-won stabilization gains and prevent ISIL’s resurgence,” adds Ms. Ali Ahmad. “Finland has been supporting the Facility since 2016 and we are proud to renew our commitment. UNDP and its partners have achieved many concrete results during these years, but Iraq still faces a multitude of challenges. Finland is a long-standing and solutions-oriented partner to Iraq,” says Ville Skinnari, Finland’s Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade. To date, FFS projects are estimated to have benefitted more than 6 million individuals in the target areas with 17.5 million benefits accruing to them, mostly in Ninewa and Salah al-Din, and in sectors such as electricity, health and water. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
The Ambassador of Italy to Jordan, Fabio Cassese, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Representative in Jordan, Nabil Assaf, signed today a EUR 1 million agreement to increase the resilience of the Jordanian vulnerable communities through the Italy-funded “Sustainable Production and Utilization of Agro-natural Resources (SPUAR)” project, during a ceremony attended by the Head of Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) Amman, Emilio Cabasino. The initiative targets vulnerable communities and their access to socio-economic infrastructures in the governorate of Ma’an, which is the largest in Jordan and, according to the poverty report issued by the Jordanian Department of Statistics, one of the poorest governorates in the Country, with a poverty ratio of 27%. “In recognition of the importance to support the agriculture sector and sustainable management of natural resources in a Country like Jordan challenged by desertification, drought and land degradation“, said Ambassador Cassese, “Italy’s partnership with FAO focuses on actions to counteract the detrimental impact of resource scarcity upon human development and poverty”. The scarcity of water resources is indeed one of the main challenges for Jordan and a limiting factor for economic development, especially for the agriculture sector. The demand on water resources is increasing with time for both agriculture and non-agricultural purposes, as the agricultural sector consumes around 510 million cubic meters (51%) of the annual available fresh water. “In response to the current water scarcity status in Jordan, this project will be implemented in Southern Jordan targeting the most vulnerable households in Ma’an governorate with an enabling environment for women's enhanced participation, by establishing non-conventional water resources from collecting rain water for the benefit of agriculture and the enhancement of the well-being of the targeted beneficiaries”, said Mr Nabil Assaf. The initiative aims to establish a sustainable enterprise using the agro-natural resources (land, water, vegetation) available in the targeted governorate. “Within the two-year project,” added Mr Cabasino, “we aim to target a total of 120 households (660 persons), including female headed households, youth and people with disabilities, with actions that include rooftop water harvesting systems and provision of food processing equipment, as well as a capacity building programme to equip beneficiaries with the necessary skills to maximize the use of agro-natural resources and enhance their livelihood”. In addition to improved food security and income-generation opportunities, the project will result in soil and water conservation through their sustainable management, and will ultimately contribute to empower local rural communities.
Timely and reliable disaggregated data and official statistics are critical for understanding, managing, and mitigating the health, social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. They are also essential for designing effective, evidence-based responses to the crisis and to drive an inclusive and sustainable recovery, that leaves no one behind. While data is critical for policymaking in ‘normal times’, the pandemic has served to further elevate the importance of data to save lives and to recover better. Cambodia has made progress in increasing the availability of data, however significant data gaps exist, including in the level of disaggregation required, geographical coverage and timeliness.[1] The United Nations has prioritised assistance to the Royal Government of Cambodia to improve the quality, accessibility and disaggregation of data and statistics. The United Nations is working to strengthen national capacity to enable this and is contributing to the production of reliable data that is needed to respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Assistance also centres on improving national capacity for the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other national indicators to foster achievement of the 2030 Agenda. In line with this, the United Nations is supporting the Ministry of Planning and the National Institute of Statistics, as well as line Ministries to improve the availability and utilization of data for sustainable development including to better link data to planning and budgeting processes. The focus has been on providing support for the implementation and roll out of the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) to enhance statistical systems in line with international standards. The United Nations is also supporting the collection of key statistical data through national census, demographic, social and economic surveys, and administrative data systems that will provide quality data for use in monitoring national development frameworks and to guide policy direction. This incorporates support for the Government’s SDG monitoring and reporting along with the setup of the National Development/SDGs Indicators Reporting and Data Exchange among Government line ministries through the National Platform - CAMSTAT which includes a CSDG/SDG tracking portal. In the current context of the pandemic, reliable data will be essential to support SDG acceleration efforts to enable Cambodia to remain on track to achieve the SDGs. The United Nations has carried out a series of rapid assessments and surveys, together with its partners to collect data to better understand the varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health, society and the economy especially for vulnerable groups. This has included impact assessments and surveys to glean data on the impact of the pandemic on children, women, youth, people with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, sexual reproductive health, returning migrants, garment workers, informal workers, as well as on small and medium enterprises. Many of the surveys have been undertaken in several rounds and intervals and have contributed to informing government policymaking and programme adjustment to better respond to the evolving COVID 19 situation. The United Nations is also contributing quality data through regular household-based data collection to measure the evolution of food security and nutrition and the effectiveness of mitigation measures in Cambodia. The United Nations carries out remote price and market monitoring in cooperation with the Agricultural Marketing Office (AMO) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and produces monthly monitoring reports (Cambodia Market Update) that provide data and insights on price trends, market functionality and supply chains, agricultural production to understand prevailing market conditions and the implications for households in Cambodia and Government policy responses. The United Nations collects monthly agricultural production data on Cambodia to provide early warning through the Global Information and Early Warning System. This monitoring continues through the COVID-19 pandemic and gives a snapshot of the Earth Observation Indicators targeting seasonal indicators, vegetation indicators, and precipitation indicators. The United Nations agency - World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Health of Cambodia prepare regular COVID-19 situation reports to highlight the most recent developments in the health response to COVID-19. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the United Nations has also supported the Royal Government to track the number of Cambodian returning migrants and the situation at borders and in quarantine to inform more effective policy responses. The United Nations is also working on shock responsive social assistance connecting IDPoor data, with the social protection system and the national disaster management system. Support has also been provided for a range of information management systems such as the Child Protection Information Management System; and Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM). The United Nations worked with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to build some of the first models able to estimate COVID19’s social and economic impact. This work showed how stimulus packages that included social protection not only improve GDP but significantly reduce poverty and unemployment. Further work revealed how reduced access to education due to pandemic conditions caused a reduction in Cambodia’s Human Development Index. To promote wide access to data, the United Nations hosts a public Reports Dashboard, which contains the latest published and upcoming research and assessments on Cambodia, drawn from various partners. This includes research on the impacts of COVID 19. As of 5 July 2021, 168 completed and ongoing assessments were included in the dashboard. The dashboard provides visualizations and simple analytics of reports. It helps to assess and identify knowledge gaps; create benchmarks to track progress in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted challenges and vulnerabilities in data production and systems. The Royal Government of Cambodia, with support from its partners, has made efforts to generate data and evidence to inform policy decision and programme adjustments. In this light, the United Nations encourages the authorities to continue its efforts to strengthen national data and statistical systems to ensure that data can better contribute to leaving no one behind and to fostering equality and sustainable development. To effectively do this, data production systems must respond more effectively and quickly to the changing environment and better anticipate risks. The United Nations encourages better use of digital technologies, innovation, and new data sources to provide more timely data. The United Nations also encourages the authorities to promote greater data literacy and data governance. Highlighting the crucial role data plays in the pandemic response, the United Nations urges the authorities to ensure a balance between protecting public health and the right to privacy. Adequate data privacy and protection of personal information are achieved through appropriate legal and policy measures. At the same time balancing and respecting the importance of ensuring transparency and accessibility to data that is in the public interest is crucial. It is important to adopt a holistic and whole-of-government approach to data governance with the engagement of all stakeholders and partners across sectors. Greater effort is required to overcome data silos and priority should be placed on enhancing the capacity for the collection of disaggregated data to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable groups that are most impacted by the pandemic. The United Nations will continue to partner with the Royal Government and other partners to improve the availability, timeliness and utilization of quality data and statistics necessary to respond to the pandemic, future crisis and to accelerate action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

Digital technology and innovation can help us deal with complex global challenges and achieve sustainable prosperity for humanity and our planet. But they can also drive us apart and fuel inequality. Digital technology and innovation at large is transforming our world. Faster internet, satellite data and imagery, machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made our lives and economies unrecognizable from just a generation ago. These technologies can help us deal with complex global challenges and achieve sustainable prosperity for humanity and our planet. But they can also drive us apart and fuel inequality. As governments adapt to this rapidly-changing technological environment, so must UNDP if it is to remain a trusted and effective partner. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the African Union (AU) 2063 Agenda are ambitious plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. The achievement of these goals would be enhanced by the full implementation of the AU’s 10-year Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA-2024) that considers science, technology and innovation as multi-function tools and enablers for achieving continental development goals. Regrettably, it is clear that the actions we are taking in terms of science, technology and innovation are not yet making an impact across critical sectors such as agriculture, energy, environment, health, infrastructure development, mining, security and water among others that contribute to Africa’s transformation, , nor at the scale and pace needed to achieve the 17 Goals. We all must join forces, with multi-stakeholder platforms as the one that TICAD represents for Africa, and leverage new opportunities in science, technology and innovation to create the continent we are all striving for. The potential of STI in Africa rests on building and/or upgrading research infrastructures; enhancing professional and technical competencies; promoting entrepreneurship and innovation; and providing an enabling environment for STI development across Africa. There are emerging opportunities to accelerate progress in this regard, particularly in terms of what is sometimes referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution – demonstrating the magnitude of the change –, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchains and machine learning are transforming societies, economies, public and private sector organizations, and individuals across the globe. These emerging technologies have the potential to advance sustainable development and lead to greater development impact – while also presenting a risk to drive us apart and fuel inequality. As such, mobilizing public, private and donor resources to finance Research and Development and creating an enabling environment for multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration in open Innovation and Entrepreneurship remains the key to accelerating Africa’s transition to an innovation-led, Knowledge-based Economy. Fostering innovation for accelerated socio-economic gain is now a priority for UNDP in Africa and our organization has just launched its first Digital Strategy, which is a call to action and innovation both for UN and our network of partners. Financing the SDGs – both through public and private resources – is at the core of UNDP’s efforts. As a systemic challenge, it demands the re-orientation of how public and private actors interact with each other to achieve the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. The required collective efforts by governments, the private sector, philanthropy and civil society as well as the necessary re-shaping of markets to become more inclusive, equitable and sustainable must make use of technological advances and innovative financing approaches, in particular financing schemes that combine the resources and technical expertise of both the public and private sector. Turning to intra-African trade, which has recently received a boost through the ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and can promote inclusion and equality, digitization can lower barriers to entry and help connect Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with global markets and value chains, providing the necessary services to facilitate their exports, such as simplified payments and logistics. With the right policies in place, e-commerce in Africa could reach 75 billion USD by 2025 and could be of particular benefit to MSMEs, which constitute more than 80 per cent of African enterprises. Overwhelming successes are already emerging, such as Jumia, the “African Amazon”, which has become the continent’s first unicorn being valued at over 1 billion USD. However, for trade to take full advantage of technology and innovation, African countries must first close the digital divide and increase access to technologies in order to ensure the broader adoption of digital technologies. African governments need to pursue industrialization by combining physical and digital infrastructure improvements. Harnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution requires urgent investments in human capital development that is tailored to the changing needs of businesses. With the rise in new technologies and automation globally, the continent is primed to exploit such opportunities because of a young and more educated population. YouthConnekt Africa, a multi-dimensional youth empowerment programme implemented in approx. ten African countries, and the complementary YAS! Youth for Africa and SDGs initiative that focuses on youth entrepreneurship on the continental level, are clear examples of this approach that UNDP supports. The possibilities that are emerging to advance sustainable development in Africa by strategically applying science, technology and innovation – in SDG financing and trade, and beyond. UNDP is committed to work together to ensure this digital revolution leads to revolutionary solutions to the complex problems facing our word, including Africa.

UN Secretary-General emphasized on our responsibility to join with girls in all their diversity, amplify their power and solutions as digital change-makers, and address the obstacles they face in the digital space The strength, health and empowerment of the world’s girls is a matter for every single day of the year. The International Day of the Girl is an opportunity to recommit to this global imperative. Today’s girls are part of a digital generation. It is our responsibility to join with them in all their diversity, amplify their power and solutions as digital change-makers, and address the obstacles they face in the digital space. The path to girls’ digital equality is steep. A massive gap in internet use spanning geographies and generations has grown from 11 per cent in 2013 to 17 per cent six years later. In more than two thirds of all countries, girls make up only 15 percent of graduates in STEM subjects – science, technology, engineering and math. Girls have equal ability and immense potential in these fields, and when we empower them, everyone benefits. I saw this long before I began my political career, when I was a teacher in Lisbon and witnessed the power of education to uplift individuals and communities. That experience has guided my vision for gender equality in education ever since. Investments in closing the digital gender divide yield huge dividends for all. The United Nations is committed to working with girls so that this generation, whoever they are and whatever their circumstances, can fulfil their potential. The Generation Equality Action Coalition on Technology and Innovation is our new platform, where governments, civil society, the private sector and young leaders are coming together around collective initiatives and investments to support girls’ digital access, skills and creativity. Together, let us ensure that girls play their full part in the digital generation to design and secure our common future.
The world marks the 30th anniversary of the International Day of Older Persons as we reckon with the disproportionate and severe impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has wrought on older persons around the world – not only on their health, but on their rights and well-being. Older people must be a priority in our efforts to overcome COVID-19. In keeping with the theme of this year’s commemoration, we must also examine how the pandemic might change how we address age and ageing in our societies. Expanding opportunities for older persons and increasing their access to health, pensions and social protection will be crucial. This year’s observance falls as the world is also marking the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife, which highlights the vital role of health and social workers, such as nurses and midwives, in responding to the pandemic. The majority of them are women, including many older persons. These are the people who devote their lives to our care, and to the care of older persons, mothers and children, and deserve far greater support. As we seek to recover better together, we must make concerted efforts across the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2020-2030 to improve the lives of older persons, their families and communities. The potential of older persons is a powerful basis for sustainable development. More than ever, we must listen to their voices, suggestions and ideas to build more inclusive and age-friendly societies. UNESCO, PCRWR and partners launch reports on UN World Water Development 2020; Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain Islamabad, 30 September — UNESCO Islamabad in partnership with Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), and in collaboration with The Asia Foundation, theUnited States Agency for International Development and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) launched two reports; the UN World Water Development Report 2020, and PCRWR’s Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain. The launch was followed by a stakeholder consultation for the development of the “Groundwater Management Plan” for Pakistan. The consultation aims to help the government of Pakistan with the long-term management of groundwater resources. The World Water Development Report 2020 sheds light on the impact of climate change on the availability, quality and quantity of water needed for basic human needs, thus undermining the basic rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for billions of people. Such a situation will also hinder the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6, that ensures access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all. This presents a considerable challenge as 2.2 billion people currently do not have access to safely managed drinking water, and 4.2 billion, or 55% of the world's population, are without safely managed sanitation. The report on Groundwater Investigations and Mapping in the Lower Indus Plain provides information on areas where groundwater is under stress due to water depletion and quality deterioration. The report also identifies areas where usable groundwater is available. This information will help the stakeholders in future groundwater management. Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, Federal Minister for Science and Technology in his remarks said that the present government has substantially increased the water resources development budget of the country. Ms. Patricia McPhillips, UNESCO Representative in Pakistan, Dr. Muhammad Ashraf, Chairman, PCRWR, Mr. Muhammad Nawaz, USAID and Mr. Farid Alam, Director Programs, The Asia Foundation spoke on different aspects of water and climate change.

Kigali, 21 June 2021 - Ange Kagame joins the ‘Parenting Month’ campaign in Rwanda by sharing tips for parents on how to boost their babies’ brain development through play. A month-long campaign was launched on 1 June 2021, by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion, National Child Development Agency, UNICEF, and other partners to promote positive parenting. In the video, Ange Kagame talks about how a baby’s brain develops most in the first 1,000 days at a pace never repeated again. She also highlights the role of both parents, male and female in the overall development of their baby. In the earliest years of life, a child’s brain develops at an astounding speed of more than 1 million new neural connections every second. This period offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape a child’s ability to learn, grow, form healthy relationships, and contribute fully to society in adulthood. Parents are the key providers of health, nutrition, stimulation, opportunities for early learning, and protection that babies need for healthy brain development. Another area where parents can contribute significantly to a child’s development is by playing with the baby. This helps babies learn and build crucial life skills – from problem-solving to expressing ideas – and strengthening the bond between child and parent. Parenting is one of the most challenging jobs in the world and now COVID-19 has placed even more pressure on parents and caregivers to support their children’s learning and development, keep their households functioning, and look after their families’ wellbeing. The video explains the various techniques such as ‘serve and return’ that parents can use to strengthen their bond with their babies while ensuring their holistic development. UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, to build a better world for everyone. For more information about UNICEF and its work for children, visit www.unicef.org.

The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Alice Wairimu Nderitu is very concerned at pronouncements from officials in Montenegro questioning the commission of the crime of genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 1995. She also notes a series of concerning developments in that country that contribute to sowing fear, mistrust and hate. Genocide and other atrocity crimes must not be a matter of any kind of arbitration, especially those legally processed based on evidence. The terrible events that occurred at Srebrenica in July 1995 have been adjudicated by the ICTY and ICJ. Both the ICTY and the International Court of Justice have concluded that the acts committed at Srebrenica constituted genocide. There is simply no space for denial or relativization of Srebrenica genocide and the legitimacy of the ICTY. The Secretary-General, in his message on the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina last year, called on “everyone in the region and beyond to counter hate speech and the rhetoric of division and narratives of mistrust and fear”. He noted that acknowledging the past is a vital step towards rebuilding trust, and that reconciliation means rejecting denial of genocide and war crimes and of any effort to glorify convicted war criminals. It also means recognizing the suffering of all victims and not attributing collective guilt. The Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide would like to remind that genocide denial divides people, communities and states; it feeds on and strengthens contested narratives about the past, the present and the future. It also undermines the judicial decisions that have been made and therefore undermines justice. Denying the genocide in Srebrenica constitutes an attack on human dignity, particularly to the victims and survivors. It is unacceptable and must be condemned. Alice Wairimu Nderitu has been appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres as Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide on 10 November 2020.
In the annual meeting, the delegations of the countries analyzed the implementation of the Action Plan (Roadmap) for the implementation of the Framework for strengthening regional cooperation of Central Asian countries in the field of DRR and emergency situations in 2019-2021 adopted by the 2019 Regional Forum - Meeting of Heads of NDMAs. The national delegations reiterated the importance of preparedness for the new emerging threats such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reiterated the value of exchange of information and experience in building capacity for reducing the possible losses. The programme of the Forum included presentation of the first draft of the Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction, developed by CESDRR within the EU-funded Initiative. The strategy, aiming at reducing risk of cross-border scale and nature, calls for better exchange of information, joint risk assessment, building capacity of emergency management organizations, raising awareness of the existing and possible new hazards. “We realize the importance of resilience at all levels, the importance of a strategy for regional cooperation, because not a single country can protect its population all by itself from the pandemic or from other threats”, stated Boobek Azhikeyev, Minister of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyz Republic. “It is inspiring to see how Central Asia countries come together to share experiences, lessons learned and good practices. Just recently, in September this year, all five countries met to share experience and to coordinate actions for overcoming the COVID-19, together with international organizations. The work of the CESDRR is another concrete example of these critical efforts’, said Mr. Octavian Bivol Chief Regional Office for Europe, UNDRR. “Next year is an important one for Member States for developing a resilient, green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening risk reduction initiatives, and improving governance. Disaster risk reduction is an investment to ensure that “never again” will we suffer such devastating consequences, whether from a biological hazard like COVID-19 or climate change. “Strengthening resilience to potential natural disasters at all levels, from community to governments, has been an essential part of European Union’s disaster risk reduction efforts in Central Asia. Since 2003, European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO) has continuously implemented activities under its disaster preparedness program known as DIPECHO. Over the years, with a total of approximately 47 mln Euro and more than 110 projects, DIPECHO managed to promote DRR in Central Asian countries.” - said Johannes Madsen, Head of Cooperation in Central Asia. The Regional Forum adopted the outcome document, resolving to: acknowledge the information on the activities in disaster risk reduction in the region; further consolidate and enhance regional coordination; review the draft Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction Following a productive discussion, the delegations stressed the significance of regional solidarity and collaboration in effectively managing disaster risk and emergency situations. They reaffirmed their commitment to continued support and active participation in the implementation of the Regional Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction. The collaborative framework set forth includes mechanisms for joint training programs, simulation exercises, and development of a unified communication platform to ensure timely and efficient exchange of critical information.  As a crucial next step, the delegations pledged to review and provide feedback on the first draft of the Regional Strategy, emphasizing the need to integrate scientific and technical advancements and to strengthen community-level resilience. The inclusion of vulnerable populations and the promotion of gender-sensitive approaches were highlighted as essential components of the strategy.  Ministers and high-level representatives reiterated their dedication to aligning national policies with the regional goals, ensuring that financial and technical resources are allocated efficiently to DRR initiatives. The forum concluded with a strong message of unity and determination to build a safer and more resilient Central Asia.  As the meeting adjourned, delegates expressed optimism for the region’s ability to tackle future challenges, underscoring the importance of continuous dialogue and cooperation. The adoption of the outcome document marks a significant milestone in the journey towards enhanced regional disaster preparedness and response capabilities, setting a precedent for robust and cooperative international efforts in disaster risk reduction.
World Bank/Visual News Associate | Women in Pakistan learn computing skills[/caption] The COVID-19 pandemic is “interrupting efforts” to achieve gender equality and threatening to “reverse hard-won gains” over the past decades, a senior UN official said on Tuesday. Introducing the 2020 edition of The World’s Women: Trends and Statistics, Liu Zhenmin, chief of the UN’s economic and social affairs department (DESA), said that over the last two decades, “attitudes of discrimination are slowly changing” and women’s lives have improved with regard to education, early marriage, childbearing and maternal mortality, all while progress has stagnated in other areas. “Women are far from having an equal voice to men”, spelled out the DESA chief. “And, in every region of the world, women are still subjected to various forms of violence and harmful practices”. Overall, progress continues to fall far short of what Member States committed themselves to, at the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women. “Twenty-five years since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, progress towards equal power and equal rights for women remains elusive”, said UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities, disproportionately impacting women and girls. "From increased domestic violence to a greater burden of care work, women are facing unprecedented challenges which threaten to erode the progress we have made," she stressed.  The 2020 edition of "The World’s Women: Trends and Statistics" provides a comprehensive analysis of the state of gender equality worldwide. It reveals that while there have been incremental improvements in areas such as girls’ education, maternal health, and the reduction of early marriage rates, substantial gaps remain. In particular, women’s participation in politics and leadership roles continues to lag significantly behind that of men.  Gender-based violence remains a pervasive issue, with millions of women and girls worldwide subjected to harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, forced marriages, and trafficking. Economic disparities also persist; women are more likely to work in informal and low-wage sectors, and they continue to earn less than men for the same work.  Moreover, the report points out that the pandemic has disrupted efforts to close these gaps. Due to lockdowns and economic slowdowns, women are more likely to be pushed out of the workforce and less likely to have access to healthcare services, including reproductive health services. School closures have also increased the risk of girls dropping out permanently, which can have long-term effects on their futures.  "COVID-19 has been a stark reminder of the entrenched inequalities that women face," said Fleming. "We must seize this moment to build back better, ensuring that women's rights are at the heart of recovery efforts." She called for renewed commitments from Member States and international organizations to prioritize gender equality in their policy responses.  The report underscores the importance of reliable data to monitor progress and inform policies. It calls for enhanced data collection and research to better understand the challenges women face and to develop effective strategies to address them.  In conclusion, the UN officials emphasized that achieving gender equality requires coordinated global action and unwavering political will. Reflecting on the 25 years since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, they urge Member States to accelerate their efforts and renew their commitment to ensuring that every woman and girl can live free from discrimination and violence, and have equal opportunities to succeed.  "Twenty-five years later, we must honor our commitments," Liu Zhenmin stated firmly. "The future of our societies depends on it."

A new technical cooperation project on making agriculture more resilient to climate change is about to start in Armenia with a project document signed by FAO and the Ministry of Economy of Armenia. The two-year project covers Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and North Macedonia. All four countries are facing problems of adaptation and development of independent, diversified agricultural structures. One limiting factor is that the majority of seeds, and other input materials, come from outside, thus, farmers depend on imported seeds. They cannot yet fully benefit from the advantages of quality seeds due to a combination of factors, including hampered seed production, distribution, and quality assurance systems, as well as bottlenecks caused by a lack of good seed policy on key issues. “Armenia, similarly to Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, and Tajikistan, is facing similar risks due to climate change, and the agricultural production of the countries is severely affected. The new technical cooperation project aims to bolster the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change by addressing these challenges comprehensively.  A critical component of the project is enhancing local seed production capabilities and creating a sustainable, high-quality seed supply chain. By producing and distributing quality seeds locally, the project hopes to reduce dependency on imported seeds and improve the adaptability and productivity of local crops. The project will focus on developing a conducive environment for seed policy formulation, facilitating knowledge transfer, and building capacities among stakeholders, including farmers, seed producers, and government bodies.  The project will also implement innovative agricultural practices that are climate-resilient and sustainable. This includes the introduction of drought-resistant crop varieties, improved soil management techniques, and efficient water use practices. In doing so, the project aims to safeguard agricultural productivity against the increasingly unpredictable climate patterns faced by these countries.  To ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions, the project will emphasize multi-stakeholder collaboration and local community engagement. Training programs, workshops, and knowledge-sharing platforms will be established to foster a participatory approach and empower the local agricultural community.  Dr. Qu Dongyu, the Director-General of FAO, stated, "This cooperation project represents a significant step forward for the agricultural sectors in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and North Macedonia. By focusing on local seed production and climate-smart agricultural practices, we are laying the groundwork for more resilient and sustainable agricultural systems. Our goal is to ensure food security and improve the livelihoods of farmers in the face of climate change."  The project will not only address immediate seed production and distribution issues but also invest in long-term solutions by promoting research and innovation in agriculture. By the end of the two-year period, it is expected that the agricultural sectors in all four countries will have a stronger foundation, fostering greater independence and resilience against the adverse impacts of climate change.
BISHKEK – The COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious threats to food security and nutrition of the poorest people in the Kyrgyz Republic, particularly those living in urban areas, according to a new study released by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) together with National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic (NSC). Poverty, Food Security and Nutrition Analysis in the context of COVID-19 and the role of Social Protection in the Kyrgyz Republic draws upon data from across the country gathered before and after the pandemic struck. The comparisons show that drops in income have not only reduced demand for food, but also induced shifts in the mix of products consumed, with families eating less nutrient-rich foods, like fruits, vegetables, and animal-sourced foods, and more calorie rich-foods, like bread and sugar. A profound economic crisis caused by the pandemic has resulted in an increase in newly poor and unemployed people in the Kyrgys Republic. In order to cope, families reported applying different coping strategies that have impacted negatively on their nutrition, health and productivity, and will be difficult to reverse in the future, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and vulnerability. In addition to ’stress’ coping strategies (e.g. borrowing money to meet food needs), more households had to apply ‘crisis’ and ‘emergency’ type strategies, such as selling assets, reducing spending on essential non-food items, selling property, and asking for humanitarian assistance. The number of households resorting to these coping strategies increased from 12 percent in 2020 to 36 percent in 2021. This translates into a reduced ability to deal with future shocks, reduction of current and future productivity, and the jeopardizing of future livelihoods. “This important analysis demonstrates the alarming effects of the pandemic on the population’s food and nutrition security, and how food insecurity and malnutrition are closely linked to poverty,” said Michael Huggins, WFP Kyrgyz Republic Officer-in-Charge. “Critical measures need to be taken now to strengthen the government’s approach to social protection to help the families, and the country, fully recover from the socio-economic fallout of COVID-19.” Some of the recommendations include focusing on income-generating activities and poverty graduation programmes to build people’s resilience; fostering inter-sectoral linkages between social protection and food systems; promoting healthy and diverse diets among the population; and strengthening the design of social benefits to make sure that “no one is left behind.” The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. We are the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) has handed over personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic within the framework of the fight against COVID-19 infectious disease in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. Personal protective equipment is being provided under the WHO pipeline. PPE shipment includes 950 protective overalls; 100 infrared thermometers; 950 of disposable gloves; 950 goggles; 950 type FFP 2 face masks. The total cost of humanitarian aid comprises more than 22, 000 USD. This personal protective equipment will enable healthcare providers and primary care providers across the country to promptly and safely fight COVID-19 in the country. These items are supplied upon the request of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to combat COVID-19. The Sanitary and Epidemiological Service of the Kyrgyz Republic plans to distribute half of the PPEs to health care facilities in the south of the country. In addition, at the request of the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic 2 procurements were completed and supply of laboratory consumables for sample collection and testing was organized (tubes, swabs, kits, reagents, etc.), amounting to about 36,000 USD. WHO continuously provides updated evidence-based data, recommendations, guidelines on COVID-19 Prevention, Laboratory Diagnosis and Treatment to the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Health and health workers on a regular basis. WHO has also handed over the printed communication materials on COVID-19 risks to the KR MOH, which were distributed to the general public across the country. These materials were jointly adapted by the Ministry of Health of the Kyrgyz Republic. In mid-March, WHO in close collaboration with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) had provided the Kyrgyz Republic with protective protection equipment: 10 000 gowns, 1950 pieces of protective masks, 20,000 pairs of gloves, 700 tubes, 1370 pieces of various laboratory consumables, 400 pieces of infrared thermometers, and 30 containers for shipping tests. The ongoing collaboration between WHO, USAID, and the Kyrgyz Ministry of Health underscores a united approach to combat the global threat posed by COVID-19.   Dr. Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, emphasized the significance of international cooperation in overcoming the pandemic. "Only through unified global efforts can we effectively tackle COVID-19 and safeguard populations."   The Kyrgyz Republic's Ministry of Health expresses gratitude for these substantial contributions, which crucially strengthen the country's healthcare infrastructure during this challenging period. Efforts remain focused on safeguarding health workers, enhancing testing capacities, and disseminating essential health information to curb the spread of the virus.   This joint mission reaffirms the commitment to health equity and a shared vision of a healthier, safer world.
Today, we remember and pay tribute to all victims and survivors of terrorism. We stand in solidarity with those whose loved ones have been killed, those who… Today, we remember and pay tribute to all victims and survivors of terrorism. We stand in solidarity with those whose loved ones have been killed, those who still suffer from physical and psychological harm, and those communities and societies that have been permanently scarred by terrorist acts. We support survivors by listening to and amplifying their voices, upholding their rights and providing the support, justice and dignity to which they are entitled. This year’s observance focuses on the importance of connections, especially during the ongoing pandemic, which continues to restrict movements, limit peoples’ ability to see loved ones and, for victims and survivors, denies them the opportunity to come together to support each other. Connection can be a powerful agent of healing, helping terrorism survivors around the world to feel heard, seen and less alone. Connections between survivors, victims’ associations, civil society and Member States are also crucial in helping better uphold the rights and needs of victims of terrorism. Together, we can foster an environment where survivors feel supported and acknowledged. During this observance, let us reaffirm our commitment to standing against terrorism in all its forms and ensuring that the voices of victims and survivors remain at the forefront of our efforts. By strengthening our connections and support systems, we can contribute to a world where resilience and solidarity triumph over violence and fear. Let us honor the memory of those we have lost and empower those who have endured, striving for a future free from terrorism.
Today, Ethiopia joins the rest of the world in commemorating the Menstrual Hygiene Day under the theme, “Periods in Pandemic – it is time to take action!” The objective this year is to emphasize the importance of continuing menstrual hygiene awareness and support for women and girls during COVID-19, especially for those living in poverty, the internally displaced, refugees, and those in quarantine and transit centers. A pandemic such as COVID-19 doesn’t stop activities to support the basic menstrual hygiene needs of women and girls, including those who are on the frontlines of the pandemic. It is imperative that girls and women living in poverty, the internally displaced, refugees, and those in quarantine and transit centers are provided with menstrual hygiene kits. This is part of preserving their dignity amidst the difficult conditions they are living in. “Given the multiple challenges that women and adolescent girls face, it is evident that promoting menstrual hygiene management is not only a health and sanitation matter, it is also a crucial step towards safeguarding the dignity, integrity and overall life opportunities for women and girls,” says Minister of Health Dr. Lia Tadesse. Since 2016, the Federal Ministry of Health, together with government and civil society partners, has been implementing a comprehensive menstrual hygiene and health programme in the country. The programme includes raising awareness in schools and surrounding communities to reduce stigma around menstruation, providing appropriate water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, as well as distributing menstrual hygiene materials to those in need. This integrated approach underscores the Ethiopian government’s commitment to addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with menstrual hygiene management, especially in the context of a global pandemic.  Furthermore, the programme’s expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly significant. While the virus has disrupted many aspects of daily life, the needs of women and girls for adequate menstrual hygiene management have not diminished. In fact, the pandemic has exacerbated these needs, making it even more critical to ensure consistent and reliable access to menstrual hygiene products and facilities.  One of the key initiatives under this programme is the dissemination of menstrual hygiene kits. Each kit contains reusable sanitary pads, soap, hand sanitizers, and educational materials on menstrual health. This initiative is strategically targeted towards vulnerable groups, including those in poverty-stricken areas, internally displaced populations, refugees, and women and girls in quarantine or transit centers. The distribution of these kits is essential not only for maintaining hygiene but also for upholding the dignity and self-esteem of those affected.  In addition, the Federal Ministry of Health, in cooperation with partners, is implementing training sessions for health workers, teachers, and community leaders to foster a more supportive environment. These sessions focus on various aspects of menstrual hygiene management, including breaking taboos, understanding the health implications of poor menstrual hygiene, and promoting gender equality.  Minister of Health Dr. Lia Tadesse emphasizes, “The role of our community and educational leaders is pivotal in transforming societal attitudes towards menstruation. By equipping them with the right knowledge and tools, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all women and girls.”  The Ministry also leverages media platforms and technology to disseminate information widely. Radio programs, television segments, and social media campaigns have been rolled out to educate the public and normalize discussions around menstrual health.  Dr. Tadesse further highlights the economic implications of menstrual hygiene. “When women and girls are able to manage their menstruation with dignity, it contributes positively to their productivity and participation in education, the workforce, and community activities. This is not just a health issue; it is also an economic and social development issue.”  The efforts to improve menstrual hygiene management are part of a broader strategy to enhance reproductive health services and the overall well-being of women and girls in Ethiopia. The Ministry of Health's initiatives demonstrate a commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women, recognizing that menstrual hygiene is integral to these goals.  As Ethiopia joins the global community in celebrating Menstrual Hygiene Day, the message is clear: it is time to take action. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgency of supporting women and girls in managing their menstrual health with dignity. By continuing to invest in menstrual hygiene management, Ethiopia reiterates its dedication to upholding the rights and health of women and girls, ensuring that no one is left behind, even amidst a global crisis.  In conclusion, the observance of Menstrual Hygiene Day in Ethiopia under the theme “Periods in Pandemic – it is time to take action!” serves as a timely reminder of the ongoing challenges and the collective responsibility to address them. Through concerted efforts by the government, civil society, and communities, significant strides can be made towards ensuring menstrual hygiene for all, thereby fostering a healthier, more equitable society.
Baghdad: After 3 years of fruitful collaboration between UN-Habitat Iraq and the Ministry of Justice of Iraq, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with the support of the Prime Minister of Iraq, and under the patronage of Mr. Salar Abdul Sattar Muhammad, Minister of Justice. The MOU aims to strengthen the cooperation between UN-Habitat and Ministry of Justice through joint efforts to secure and protect land tenure rights, and to facilitate the registration of ownership rights as one of the most critical durable solutions for Yazidis in Sinjar district. Additionally, the MOU strives to seek and explore potential solutions and legal approaches with respect to ownership rights and documentation, and remedy the effects resulting from the destruction of documents in the city of Mosul. Yazidis in Sinjar area face major challenges in proving their ownership or occupancy land rights, particularly where official documents are missing, damaged, destroyed, or in the absence of cadastral and registry information and maps delineating land and property to prove ownership or occupancy rights. Addressing and resolving Yazidi land rights would mark a major step towards respecting human rights and reconciliation. UN-Habitat has been addressing land rights of Yazidi minorities in Sinjar area since 2016, immediately after the area was liberated from ISIL. The agency is implementing a programme titled “Support to Housing, Land and Property Rights for IDPs in Nineveh” which aims to facilitate the sustainable return and focuses on vulnerable IDPs from minorities (Yazidis) whose access to Housing, Land and Property (HLP) rights has been denied for decades by a legacy of discriminatory policies and practices against Yazidis, as well as by recent violent conflict. UN-Habitat is registering and mapping land claims by Yazidi returnees, supporting the verification of their claim among themselves, and issuing “Occupancy Certificates” that are endorsed by local authorities and community representatives. The issuance of occupancy certificates by UN-Habitat is a first step toward the final registration of Yazidis land rights in Iraq. More than 7,600 Occupancy Certificates have been distributed to Yazidis returnees so far, recognizing their occupancy rights for the first time in modern history. UN-Habitat is also liaising closely with the Prime Minister’s Office and the Iraqi Ministry of Justice to endorse a legal decree to formalize the recognition of land rights and upgrade the occupancy certificates to full “Land Ownership Titles”. Mr. Ahmed Luebi, Director General of the Department for Justice Affairs in the Ministry of Justice, stated that the signing of the MOU with UN-Habitat is necessary to ensure the sustainable return of the displaced people and the right of Yazidis to own land in Sinjar, which is considered one of the most important areas in Iraq. Further, he outlined that the MOU was drafted with the support of Prime Minister and the efforts of the Minister of Justice, Judge Salar Abdul Sattar Muhammed. Wael Al-Ashhab, Head of UN-Habitat Iraq, emphasized that the signing of MOU is as result of great collaboration with Ministry of Justice which is our main counterpart in our journey to facilitate the registration of Yazidis land rights. UN-Habitat will continue to support MOJ to finalize the registration of Yazidis land rights and additional support will be provided to Real Estate Registration Office in Mosul by building capacity on housing, land and property related issues. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
The event is a part of a joint Action Plan between UN and the Interdepartmental Commission on the implementation of international human rights obligations. “The promotion and protection of human rights is also reflected as an integral component of the new Cooperation framework for 2021-2025 and in the Socio-economic response plan in Turkmenistan to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic in the country”, noted Ms. Elena Panova, UN Resident Coordinator in Turkmenistan. The members of the of Interdepartmental commission as well as representatives of Office of Ombudsmen, UN Agencies reviewed the national mechanisms on development of reports and key functions of tracking database in the area of human rights presented by OHCHR Human Rights Advisors. They have also learnt the international experience in developing the database and its effectiveness. The development of online database will contribute to the digitalization of monitoring and reporting processes and contribute to the monitoring of the implementation of existing action plans in the field of human rights, the Action Plan for Gender Equality, the Action Plan for the Realization of the Rights of the Child and others, and will also contribute to the implementation of the state Digital Economy concept.
13 July 2021 – After a decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths across WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region for 8 consecutive weeks, several countries are seeing a significant increase in new cases and deaths. Significant increases in COVID-19 cases have been reported from Libya, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, and Tunisia. Lebanon and Morocco have also started to see a rise in cases, with an exponential increase expected in these 2 countries in the coming weeks. “We are reaching a critical point for COVID-19 in our Region,” said Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean. “Just one week after reaching the grim milestone of 11 million cases, we are now seeing an upward spike in a number of countries. This is being aggravated by new variants circulating – most concerningly the Delta variant – low vaccine availability and uptake, and lack of adherence to public health and social measures.” With the Eid al-Adha feast taking place during the week starting 20 July, traditionally marked by religious and social gatherings, WHO is concerned that the current upsurge may continue to peak in the coming weeks, with catastrophic consequences. “Countries are reintroducing or strengthening social and travel restrictions, but at this stage, increasing complacency by communities means that the virus is winning in the Region. “As variants continue to spread, we need everyone to get vaccinated as soon as they are offered the vaccine, and to continue wearing masks, and practising physical distancing. Although significant progress has been made, there remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines, and this leaves millions of people exposed to deadly variants of concern. It is not too late to turn the course of this pandemic, but it requires much more exerted global, regional and national efforts,” said Dr Al-Mandhari. The total number of cases across the Region now exceeds 11.4 million, and the number of deaths is more than 223 000, with 19 out of 22 countries now reporting at least one new variant circulating. Tunisia reports the highest COVID-19 mortality rate of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and the African continent. The situation in the country continues to be extremely concerning. Between 8000 and 9500 cases are currently being reported every day, with wide circulation of the Delta variant. In less than one week, the number of deaths almost doubled, from 119 deaths on 5 July to 189 deaths on 8 July. Vaccine coverage is increasing, especially among people older than 60, but coverage is still low, with 12.7% of the population receiving at least one dose of vaccine, and 6% fully vaccinated. Public health measures have been strengthened, including suspension of social events and closures of businesses. Full lockdown is being implemented in some governorates, but the impact of these measures on the circulation of the virus and daily incidence needs to be strictly monitored. Oxygen beds are at 90% occupancy and intensive care unit beds are at 95% occupancy. In some governorates, hospital beds are over capacity. Hospitals are overwhelmed with limited numbers of available beds, and risk of shortage of oxygen supply. They also suffer from limited human resources, with medical staff very dedicated, but exhausted. Support to Tunisia has been remarkable, with countries in the Region and beyond stepping up to deliver field hospitals, medical equipment and oxygen cylinders, and additional vaccines, highlighting the spirit of solidarity and action within the Regional 2023 Vision of Health for All by All. WHO, like other international partners, is committed to supporting Tunisia in facing this crisis, including by procuring additional oxygen concentrators and generators to hospitals, as well as medical supplies, tests, reagents and PPE, and supporting provision of additional vaccines. Through the Emergency Medical Teams Initiative, WHO is also reaching out to its network partners for the possible deployment of international emergency medical teams to provide surge support in the areas of intensive and critical care, infection control and infectious diseases. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the number of cases has been increasing since mid-June. The daily average almost doubled during the past 4 weeks, increasing from 8539 on week of 6 June on the week of 6 June to 16,084 in the first week of July. The Delta variant has been reported in 10 out of 31 provinces, contributing to a surge in hospitalizations and pressure on health services. Vaccination efforts are ongoing, but only around 4% of the population is fully vaccinated. Health authorities are enforcing stricter social and travel measures to mitigate the spread.  Iraq has also seen a sharp increase in cases, with between 7,000 and 9,000 cases reported daily in early July. The Delta variant is present and spreading rapidly. Like other countries in the region, Iraq is facing challenges with limited vaccine supply and low public adherence to health measures. The health system is under significant strain, with ICU capacity nearing full utilization.  Morocco and Lebanon, while currently experiencing lower case numbers compared to Tunisia and Iran, are on the brink of a potential surge. Morocco has observed an increase in transmission following the easing of public health measures and increased movement during the summer. Lebanon's health system, already fragile due to the ongoing economic crisis, is preparing for an anticipated rise in cases.  With the approach of Eid al-Adha, WHO emphasizes the importance of adhering to health guidelines and maintaining public vigilance to avoid exacerbating the situation. "Communities need to understand the critical role they play in curbing transmission. Personal and communal sacrifices during this festive period can significantly impact the trajectory of this pandemic," said Dr. Al-Mandhari.  The overall COVID-19 situation in the Eastern Mediterranean Region highlights the urgent need for equitable vaccine distribution and increased public health interventions. WHO urges countries and international organizations to support the region's efforts to curtail the pandemic. Enhanced vaccine procurement, healthcare infrastructure support, and community engagement are paramount to reversing current trends.  "Global solidarity and cooperation are crucial. We need to close the vaccine equity gap and ensure that all countries have the resources required to fight COVID-19 effectively," Dr. Al-Mandhari concluded. WHO remains committed to working with countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to achieve health for all, by all.
At the Last United Nations General Assembly in September 2020, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic together with other world leaders reconfirmed the need for fundamental socio-economic transformation in order to reach the sustainable future outlined in the 2030 Agenda. The window for action is the next decade which we entered this year, and which was recognized by the UN General Assembly as “decisive decade for People and the Planet”. The United Nations in the Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the efforts of the Government of Kyrgyz Republic, civil society, academia, media, private sector and other stakeholders on promoting equality, preventing violence against women, and fostering the participation of women in public life and honoring the State’s commitments to women and girls of Kyrgyzstan. The 2030 Agenda reaffirms that gender equality is an essential foundation for sustainable development in any country. Therefore the national development of the Kyrgyz Republic is directly related to how much Kyrgyzstani women are able to participate and to hold leadership positions in the society and economy. A gender-responsive path towards the SDGs in Kyrgyzstan largely depends on how the State will be able to accelerate its actions to fulfill existing and new commitments to gender equality and women’s human rights. This year, the theme for International Women’s Day, “Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world,” celebrates the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights the gaps that remain. Women’s full and effective participation and leadership in all areas of life drives progress for everyone. The role of women in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kyrgyzstan has proven the same. Yet, women are still underrepresented in public life and decision-making. In addition to persisting social and systemic barriers to women's participation and leadership, the COVID-19 pandemic has created new barriers. Women face an increase in domestic violence, unpaid care responsibilities, unemployment and poverty, and women from some groups are affected more than the others. Although women make up the majority of frontline workers, there is a disproportionate and inadequate representation of women in national policy-making processes related to COVID-19. Approaching International Women’s Day serves as another reminder that the State has to accelerate its efforts to protect and promote women’s rights, dignity and leadership by creating an enabling policy, legal, institutional and other conditions for women to realize their rights. The Kyrgyz Republic should not lose the gains it has made over the past decades on women’s rights and empowerment, but should continue to push for wholesale, rapid and sustainable change. An important element for the protection human rights and empowerment of women is to ensure the proper realization of the fundamental freedoms, including the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. World leaders are uniting under the “Generation Equality Forum” appeals and signing up to the Political Engagement Strategy on ending violence against women in response to the appeal of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres. We therefore call on the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and all political and civic leaders to affirm their commitment to the appeal by Mr. Guterres, and through demonstrable action to enhance the role and participation of women in all forms of decision making in the society and the economy. On the occasion of International Women’s Day of 2021, let us all amplify and support women and girls in all spheres of life in Kyrgyzstan who are breaking down barriers and championing to create a better world for everyone. Let us all unite and bring about the real change in the lives of women and girls, working hand in hand together with them through their equal participation and voice. Let everyone commit to working towards a prosperous and bright future of Kyrgyzstan that includes all the women and girls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has posthumously honored Henrietta Lacks for the profound impact her "HeLa cells" have had on medical science. This recognition also serves to highlight and advocate for racial equity in health care.  Henrietta Lacks, an African American woman whose cancer cells were taken without her knowledge or consent in 1951, became the source of the first immortal cell line. Known as "HeLa cells," they have played a crucial role in countless scientific advancements, including the development of the polio vaccine, cancer research, and understanding of various diseases.  By awarding Lacks, the WHO aims to acknowledge her involuntary yet invaluable contribution to medicine and to spotlight the pressing need for racial equity within the health sector. This accolade not only celebrates the scientific breakthroughs made possible by HeLa cells but also calls attention to the ethical considerations and systemic racial injustices that have historically pervaded medical research.  In honoring Henrietta Lacks, the WHO emphasizes that scientific progress must go hand in hand with ethical practices and equity, ensuring that the contributions of all individuals are respected and valued.
The new guidelines recommend at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week for all adults, including people living with chronic conditions or disability, and an average of 60 minutes per day for children and adolescents. WHO statistics show that one in four adults, and four out of five adolescents, do not get enough physical activity. Globally this is estimated to cost US$54 billion in direct health care and another US$14 billion to lost productivity. The guidelines encourage women to maintain regular physical activity throughout pregnancy and post-delivery. They also highlight the valuable health benefits of physical activity for people living with disabilities. Older adults (aged 65 years or older) are advised to add activities which emphasize balance and coordination, as well as muscle strengthening, to help prevent falls and improve health. Regular physical activity is key to preventing and helping to manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and cancer, as well as reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, reducing cognitive decline, improving memory and boosting brain health. “Being physically active is critical for health and well-being – it can help to add years to life and life to years,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Every move counts, especially now as we manage the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must all move every day – safely and creatively.” All physical activity is beneficial and can be done as part of work, sport and leisure or transport (walking, wheeling and cycling), but also through dance, play and everyday household tasks, like gardening and cleaning. “Physical activity of any type, and any duration can improve health and wellbeing, but more is always better,” said Dr Ruediger Krech, Director of Health Promotion, World Health Organization, “and if you must spend a lot of time sitting still, whether at work or school, you should do more physical activity to counter the harmful effects of sedentary behaviour.” “These new guidelines highlight how important being active is for our hearts, bodies and minds, and how the favourable outcomes benefit everyone, of all ages and abilities”, said Dr Fiona Bull, Head of the Physical Activity Unit which led the development of the new WHO guidelines. WHO encourages countries to adopt the global guidelines to develop national health policies in support of the WHO Global action plan on physical activity 2018-2030. The plan was agreed by global health leaders at the 71st World Health Assembly in 2018 to reduce physical inactivity by 15% by 2030.
The project aims to minimize the COVID-19 pandemic's negative impact on people’s health through quality telehealth and telemedicine services. A new joint project on digital health: Minimizing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Georgia through telemedicine and digital health solutions was launched today at Mukhrovani Ambulatory. This three-year project is funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by four UN agencies (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOPS), working in close cooperation with the Ministry of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia. Under this new EU-UN initiative, 200 rural facilities will receive basic equipment and another 50 will receive telemedicine equipment to support the safe management of COVID-19. At the same time the new equipment will be used to ensure uninterrupted access to health care for persons with chronic conditions and provision of routine health services for children. Health care providers will also be invited to participate in online training to improve and expand their capacity to provide quality primary health care (PHC) services. Carl Hartzell, Ambassador of the European Union to Georgia stated, “Helping the people of Georgia to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic has been a key priority for the European Union from the very first day. With this innovative project that we are launching together with our UN partners, we hope to reach even more citizens throughout Georgia with healthcare services. Proper access to healthcare should be for everyone, and we hope to contribute to this goal.” “COVID-19 once again showed us the importance of a strong primary health care system; effective utilization of existing resources has enabled us to manage home care for a large number of infected patients,” said Ekaterine Tikaradze, Minister of IDPs from the Occupied Territories, Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia. “Introducing telemedicine in primary health care clinics in the regions will significantly improve the system, bringing positive results to both the population and to doctors. The capacity of village doctors will improve, as they will be provided with the newest diagnostic technologies. This has been made possible through our loyal partners, for which I am sincerely grateful.” "Development through digital transformation is part of building forward better globally as well as in all regions of Georgia,“ said Sabine Machl, UN Resident Coordinator. “Through this joint telemedicine project four UN agencies together with the EU support Georgia with digital health solutions.” “Apart from supporting the immediate response to COVID-19 at the PHC level, this project is going to build a solid and sustainable foundation for digital health and telemedicine in Georgia, by supporting the development of the necessary legal and regulatory frameworks, clinical guidelines, provision of specific trainings for PHC personnel and promoting the use of telemedicine services among health care providers and the population,” said Silviu Domente, WHO Representative and Head of Country Office in Georgia. Digital solutions for health protect and promote health and well-being, improve access to essential health services and reduce the burden on the health care system during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. In the immediate-term this project will contribute to reducing the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the health of the population and health care system in Georgia and increase access to health care regardless of location. In the long-term, EU and UN support under this project will help build a more resilient primary health care system with telemedicine capacities in Georgia and increase equitable access to health care services regardless of location and contribute to progress towards universal health coverage (UHC). The project, “Minimizing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Georgia through telemedicine and digital health solutions,” aims to harness the potential of digital tools for advancing telehealth services and promoting health in Georgia. This assistance is an integral part of the EU’s and UN’s support to the COVID-19 response in the country, as well as ongoing WHO technical assistance under the UHC-Partnership to support the commitment of national authorities to primary health care reform and the advancement of UHC in Georgia. The project will be implemented by four UN partners (WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNOPS) under WHO leadership, bringing their respective areas of expertise and added-value to contribute to the overall action’s objective to minimize the COVID-19 pandemic's negative impact on people’s health and the health system through quality telehealth and telemedicine services and to build back better by supporting a sustainable and resilient recovery in Georgia after the COVID-19 pandemic. This assistance is part of a wider support package provided by the EU and Team Europe consisting of GEL 1.5 billion of new and reallocated assistance to help Georgia address the COVID-19 pandemic, including support to vulnerable groups and economic recovery. That is one of the highest levels of EU assistance per capita to any country in the world and demonstrates the EU’s strong solidarity with Georgia at this time of unprecedented crisis.
- Geographic Indication products as the path forward towards sustainable agriculture In line with FAO’s mandate to reduce rural poverty through cross-sectorial policy advice and capacity development for the definition of sustainable rural development and poverty reduction strategies, work ...is being undertaken to promote Geographic Indication (GI) products as a key strategy. GIs can enhance the value of unique agricultural products linked to particular regions, thereby fostering economic growth and sustainability. By supporting producers in gaining GI recognition for their goods, the FAO aims to ensure fair market prices, conserve local traditions, and encourage sustainable farming practices. This initiative aligns with broader goals of reducing rural poverty and ensuring resilient food systems while preserving biodiversity and cultural heritage.
Preterm Birth Complications is One of the Main Causes for Under Five Child Mortality in Pakistan UNICEF is supporting Govt of Pakistan to expand Kangaroo Mother Care facilities to save children born prematurely Islamabad - 16 November 2021: The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) calls for accelerated efforts to save precious lives of children born prematurely as World Prematurity Day (WCD) is commemorated on November 17, 2021. The theme this year is, Zero Separation Act now! Keep parents and babies born too soon together. In Pakistan, where preterm birth is one of the three leading causes for neonatal mortality and accounts for more than one third of all deaths in newborns, UNICEF is collaborating with the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations & Coordination and provincial health departments to established Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units in health facilities across the country to save lives of children born too soon. KMC is one of the best options to provide care for babies born before time in low and middle-income countries. “Scaling up Kangaroo Mother Care in health facilities across Pakistan, is a cost-effective intervention to save preterm infants,” said Aida Girma, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. “Introduced in Pakistan by UNICEF a few years back, KMC has become increasingly popular with health professionals caring for children born before time. The essence of KMC is to keep parents and babies born before time, together as against the past practice of separating small and sick babies from their mothers. The physical and emotional closeness of baby and parents during birth, delivery and hospitalization has long-term health benefits for the child. Additional care during pregnancy, complete antenatal care, nutritious food, mental and psychosocial support to pregnant women and birth spacing can reduce premature births,” Ms. Girma added. In KMC, newborn is held closely to the chest by the parent, mother or father, with a blanket wrapped around both. The skin-to-skin contact provides warmth and prevents hyperthermia. It is medically beneficial for the baby and good for parent-child bonding. So far, 30 KMC units have been established in Pakistan with support from UNICEF and other development partners for round the clock service delivery. UNICEF has provided all the necessary equipment and materials to help establish 24 units in various public health centres - 16 in Punjab, 4 in Sindh, 1 in KP, 1 in AJK and 2 in Islamabad Capital Territory. It is collaborating with the Government to scale up KMC unites across the country. Government of Pakistan and its development partners are trying to reduce preterm births and newborn mortality due to related complications such as Birth Asphyxia, Prematurity and Sepsis. These efforts have helped reduce newborn mortality from 55 to 42 deaths per 1,000 live births during the last five years. It has also had a remarkable impact on morbidity in preterm newborns. The most vulnerable newborns are those born in marginalized groups, rural areas, urban slum environments and humanitarian settings. UNICEF emphasises that the reduction in premature births and newborn deaths can be achieved by strengthening health policies and services with focus on maternal nutrition and improving access and care for mothers and new-borns, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Globally, preterm birth is one of the leading causes of child deaths under age 5 as almost 15 million babies in the world are born prematurely and nearly 1 million die due to related complications. Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. Small and sick newborns, most of whom are born preterm, have the highest risk of death and contribute to the majority of the world’s disabled children. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective and basic care, e.g. warmth, breastfeeding support, basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.

26 December 2022; Baghdad, Iraq - The Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Governorate of Anbar and UNFPA re-opened the Ramadi Youth Safe Space on 25 December. The Youth Safe Space serves as a place for girls and boys to receive life and leadership skills, peacebuilding and edutainment activities. Originally this building was a House of Youth under the Ministry of Youth and Sports management. It was a special place for young people of Anbar and the community to build friendships and learn new skills in music, arts, science. Back in 2014, the place was used as a prison by the Islamic States in Iraq and Levant (ISIL) during the war. The building was severely damaged. After the liberation of the territories, young people in Anbar decided to bring the building back to its original purpose and make it a youth-friendly place. In 2018, UNFPA helped the youth rehabilitate two rooms for peace-building activities. As the demand for youth services grew among communities and youth, UNFPA with support from Canada, the Governor of Anbar and UIMS, completed the rehabilitation of the Youth Safe Space. Young volunteers were the ones who led the process and made decisions about how to make the place more accessible for all young people in the surrounding communities, including the most vulnerable. Once a space that reminded people of sorrow and pain, today is a place of hope and strength. Speaking at the event, the Governor of Anbar, Mr Ali Farhan Al-Dulaimi, thanked UNFPA for the continuous support and investment in the young people in Anbar. Dr Rita Columbia, UNFPA Representative in Iraq, highlighted the importance of empowering young people and engaging them in community life. She said: “I am very proud of the young volunteers who had a dream and made it a reality. Thanks to their determination and the support they received from UNFPA, Canada, the Anbar Directorate of Youth and Sports, the Governor of Anbar, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, this centre became a welcoming and truly youth-friendly space.” The opening ceremony was attended by the Anbar Governor, the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Iraq, Salem Al-Zamanan, representatives of the Ministry of Youth & Sport, the Anbar Directorate of Youth and Sports, the UNFPA Representative, and representatives of the civil society and young people. UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, delivers a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe, and every young person’s potential is fulfilled. The United Nations in Iraq comprises two field missions (UNAMI and UNITAD), UN Agencies, Funds and Programmes, working at the community, governorate and national levels across the Republic of Iraq.
On 20 June World Refugee Day UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, encourages further efforts of the Kyrgyz Republic to include refugees in health systems, education and sport and through this to support their integration into the local communities. As of the end of 2020 the Kyrgyz Republic hosted 684 refugees and asylum seekers. Many but not all of them yet have access to medical care, including COVID-19 vaccination, education and work. UNHCR will continue supporting authorities and other partners to achieve a better inclusion of all refugees in healthcare, education, employment and social protection to enable them to fully contribute to the development of their host communities. “In 2021, we mark World Refugee Day amid a continuing pandemic, which has put a strain on health care, schools and our communities. But the pandemic has also taught us that we are stronger when we stand together. Given the chance to study and work, refugees will continue to contribute to a stronger, safer and more vibrant world,” said Hans Friedrich Schodder, UNHCR Representative for Central Asia. Despite the pandemic, the number of people fleeing wars, violence, persecution and human rights violations in 2020 rose to nearly 82.4 million people, according to UNHCR’s latest annual Global Trends report released on 18 June. This is a further four per cent increase on top of the already record-high 79.5 million at the end of 2019. World Refugee Day is an opportunity to acknowledge the experiences of the millions of refugees and displaced people around the world, and to amplify their voices, needs, and aspirations. UNHCR commends the Kyrgyz Republic for its efforts thus far and calls for continued cooperation and support to ensure that all refugees, irrespective of their status, have comprehensive access to essential services and opportunities. By fostering an inclusive environment where refugees can thrive, the Kyrgyz Republic can set an example of solidarity and resilience. This World Refugee Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to upholding the rights and dignity of refugees and work collectively to build a future where every individual, regardless of background, can live a life of safety, dignity, and opportunity.
The ISG noted the precipitating socio-economic crisis in Lebanon, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. It expressed its concern at the increasing tensions in the country, including the recent protests. The ISG called for demonstrations to remain peaceful, for human rights to be protected. It further called for full accountability and justice to be served, through credible, transparent and swift investigations of the Beirut port explosion and the killing of Mr. Lokman Slim. In the context of these developments, the ISG recalled with consternation that seven months have elapsed since the resignation of the last government, inhibiting Lebanon’s ability to address its deepening and increasingly complex political, social, financial, economic and institutional challenges, and to meet the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Lebanese people. The ISG reiterated its urgent call for Lebanon’s leaders to delay no longer the formation of a fully empowered government capable of meeting the country’s urgent needs and implementing critical reforms. The ISG reiterated its firm and continuing support for Lebanon and its people. The International Support Group has brought together the United Nations and the governments of China, France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, together with the European Union and the Arab League. It was launched in September 2013 by the UN Secretary-General with former President Michel Sleiman to help mobilize support and assistance for Lebanon’s stability, sovereignty and state institutions.
The tool helps to systematically collect, and structure collected information related to regional COVID-19 response and to store it in one place. The electronic portal PHRM was launched in October 2020 together with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Public Health Center. It allows the Ministry of Health (MoH), UPHC, regional health authorities and other stakeholders to monitor the policies and epidemiological situation across regions in a systematic manner. This is the first tool of its kind among the countries of the WHO European Region. It builds on the joint initiative between the WHO Regional Office for the European Region, the European Commission and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, and the Health System Response Monitor (HSRM)1. Using the findings of the tool, the national and regional authorities can adjust the COVID-19 response. WHO Representative in Ukraine, Dr Jarno Habicht, highlights that “ this tool is crucial for national and regional authorities to coordinate restriction measures, interventions, policies and messages for the COVID-19 response in Ukraine.” As WHO Representative in Ukraine, Dr Jarno Habicht added that ”the tool could also be a useful source of information in investigation of new outbreaks in a given region, for instance relaxing public health measure and allowing big congregation of people resulting in high infection rates in subsequent weeks. With the tool, the emergency coordination centers in the Ministry of Health and the Ukrainian Public Health Center will be able to continue monitoring the impact of public health measures in near real-time. By doing so, they can anticipate and respond more swiftly and effectively to potential outbreaks, thus effectively curbing the spread of the virus. This methodological approach to data collection and analysis represents a significant step forward in the public health response to COVID-19 in Ukraine.  The PHRM tool comprises multiple functionalities that facilitate comprehensive data gathering and evaluation. It integrates various data points such as infection rates, hospitalization numbers, mortality rates, vaccination coverage, and regional compliance with public health mandates. These data points are essential for crafting well-informed, evidence-based policies that are responsive to the evolving pandemic landscape. Additionally, stakeholders can use the tool to conduct comparative analyses between different regions, providing insights into the effectiveness of different strategies and highlighting best practices that can be adopted nationwide.  Moreover, the tool offers an intuitive dashboard that presents the data in a user-friendly manner, making it accessible to a wide range of users—from policymakers and health professionals to researchers and the general public. This transparency fosters a sense of shared responsibility and encourages collaborative efforts in combating the pandemic. By providing stakeholders with real-time information, the PHRM tool ensures that decisions are made based on the latest available data, thereby enhancing the overall efficacy of the COVID-19 response.  Importantly, the development and implementation of the PHRM tool align with global health priorities and reflect Ukraine's commitment to international cooperation and adherence to WHO guidelines. The tool not only strengthens national health systems but also contributes to global health security by providing valuable data that can inform international response strategies.  In the words of the Minister of Health of Ukraine, "The launch of the PHRM tool marks a new era in our national public health strategy. It exemplifies our dedication to adopting innovative solutions that leverage technology to improve public health outcomes. We are grateful for the support of our international partners, including the WHO, the European Commission, and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, in making this tool a reality."  The successful implementation of the PHRM tool is expected to serve as a model for other countries in the WHO European Region and beyond. It showcases how digital solutions can be effectively harnessed to enhance public health responses, improve health system resilience, and safeguard the health and well-being of populations during times of crisis.  Looking ahead, the Ministry of Health and the Ukrainian Public Health Center plan to continue refining the tool based on user feedback and emerging needs. This iterative approach will ensure that the PHRM tool remains relevant and effective in addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19 and other public health threats in the future.  In conclusion, the PHRM tool represents a significant advancement in Ukraine's public health infrastructure. By enabling systematic monitoring and analysis of the COVID-19 response, it empowers national and regional authorities to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of their interventions and ultimately saving lives. The collaborative effort behind this tool underscores the importance of partnerships in achieving public health goals and highlights Ukraine's proactive approach to managing the pandemic.
INCLUDING HIV PREVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES IN PAKISTAN’S ESSENTIAL PACKAGE OF HEALTH SERVICES: A PIONEERING INITIATIVE Islamabad, 9 December 2020: The Government of Pakistan has recently launched another landmark initiative, the Essential Package of Health Services—its national version of universal health coverage. Universal health coverage is a globally promoted initiative and is in line with Pakistan’s commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly target 3 on health for all and leaving no one behind. Prime Minister Imran Khan said: “Pakistan has adopted an essential list of health services, which, once implemented, will put into action a set of preventive and curative interventions without stigma, delivered at the primary and secondary levels, that directly impact upon the health of vulnerable populations and marginalized communities; will help to achieve our human development goals; and will reduce the burden of many diseases and conditions, including HIV and AIDS.” The Essential Package of Health Services will benefit everyone, including the furthest marginalized populations in geographically far-flung areas, and will improve access to lifesaving and life-prolonging services. Pakistan has also recognized pro-poor health strategies for responding to the HIV epidemic and the need to significantly increase public-sector investment at the federal and provincial levels to enhance primary health-care services. This comprehensive package, which includes HIV prevention and treatment services, is a compelling vision of a future in which everyone, including people at the grassroots level, has access to health services that are responsive to their needs and are provided in a timely manner. Dr Faisal Sultan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, emphasized: “The provision of many health-promotive, preventive and curative services is effectively possible only if woven into the normal delivery of care at the primary level. HIV is not an exception, and its quality of care will benefit greatly once it is part of a universal package.” The Essential Package of Health Services includes specific services for people living with or affected by HIV, including: The 90,000 community-based Lady Health Workers (LHW) all over the country mandated to provide primary, preventive, promotive and curative care services mainly in remote rural and urban slum communities will now play a stronger role in providing HIV education and referral services at the community level. Comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services will now be an integral part of LHW Programme, thus normalizing HIV and reducing HIV related stigma. In the long run, it is expected to increase the uptake of HIV services and improve the quality of lives of people living with and affected by HIV. Highlighting equitable access to health services, Dr Zafar Mirza, former Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health and now WHO Advisor on Universal Health Coverage, said: “Pakistan is well on its way in advancing universal health coverage. Steady expansion of social health insurance for poor people and vulnerable groups and launching of the national essential services package are major milestones. Universal health coverage promotes equity and promotes affirmative action for marginalized and vulnerable people, including people living with or affected by HIV. Including HIV services in the Essential Package of Health Services is a critical step forward in breaking down barriers to care and ensuring that no one is left behind.”  International organizations and health bodies have welcomed Pakistan’s progressive move towards universal health coverage. UNAIDS Country Director for Pakistan, Dr. Maria Elena Filio Borromeo, remarked: “Integrating HIV services into the Essential Package of Health Services signifies a paradigm shift in how Pakistan is addressing its health challenges. It is an inclusive, people-centered approach that brings critical services closer to those who need them most, fostering a healthier society.”  One of the key components of this initiative is the enhancement of public-sector investment. By channeling more resources into the health sector at both federal and provincial levels, Pakistan aims to strengthen its entire healthcare infrastructure, particularly primary health care. This will ensure a more robust and resilient system capable of addressing a wide range of health issues, from common illnesses to chronic conditions like HIV/AIDS.  The initiative underscores Pakistan’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals and its determination to improve health outcomes for all its citizens. By providing equitable access to essential health services, including HIV prevention and treatment, the country is making significant strides towards better health and well-being for all its people, especially those who have been historically underserved.  In summary, the introduction of the Essential Package of Health Services marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s health policy. It not only addresses existing healthcare disparities but also lays down a sustainable pathway for achieving universal health coverage, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, can access the healthcare they need.
Every year on 13 October, International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction places a spotlight on how people and communities around the world are reducing their exposure to disasters. This year’s historic monsoon floods were a stark reminder that Bangladesh is truly at the forefront of the climate emergency. The floods were the second highest since 1989 and the second longest since the 1998. With over 5.4 million people directly affected, the impact of the 2020 monsoon floods on lives and livelihoods certainly call for an urgent enhancement of climate adaptation programmes for upgrading the resilience of infrastructures and communities in view of tomorrow’s more extreme and more frequent climate-related events. Given the fast-evolving context, all partners should strengthen their collaboration on risks assessment and risk analysis processes to reduce and to mitigate risks associated with infrastructure development and climate-related events in line with the HumanitarianDevelopment Nexus. In Cox’s Bazar District, Bangladesh, the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) partners – national and international NGOs and UN agencies –work intensively throughout the year with Rohingya refugee and Bangladeshi volunteers to mitigate impacts on communities from heavy rains and strong winds during the monsoon and cyclone seasons. Volunteers are at the centre of the disaster risk reduction response in Cox’s Bazar and are engaged in a wide range of mitigation activities in the camps and surrounding host communities. From providing early warning and rescuing persons from drowning to stabilizing slopes on the hilly terrain to constructing safe pathways, Rohingya and Bangladeshi volunteers are working together to protect communities and save lives while also safeguarding the environment. Humanitarian partners ensure that volunteers are able to maintain COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures. “We trained together with the Rohingya so that they could learn the ways our people have dealt with natural disasters. We shared and discussed with them our experiences,” explained Mahmud, a Bangladeshi Cyclone Preparedness Programme Volunteer. The humanitarian community has in place a 72-hour response plan for an extreme weather events, such as cyclones. The plan was developed in 2018 in cooperation the Government of Bangladesh, and in line with the Government’s Standing Orders on Disaster. “The humanitarian community has collaborated closely with authorities in Cox’s Bazar, building on years of local experience with natural disasters and established disaster risk governance. This has led to fewer injuries, less displacements and more resilient communities in and around the camps,” said Peter Kern, ISCG Acting Senior Coordinator. Host communities and nearly 860,000 Rohingya refugees face extreme weather events throughout the year, impacting their lives. The region is also impacted by climate change, which has affected the annual monsoon and cyclone season. Under the leadership of the Government of Bangladesh, the humanitarian partners and the Rohingya refugee and neighboring Bangladeshi communities are better prepared for disasters this year compared to previous years. Generous contributions from the international community to the 2020 Joint Response Plan (JRP) for Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis make this possible. The 2020 Joint Response plan, which is so far 48.2 percent funded, remains vital to sustain life-saving preparedness and response efforts for extreme weather events, which have become more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bangladesh has an excellent track record in disaster management and, the country is a striking example of effective adaptation to climate change. With the support of the United Nations and the humanitarian community, the 2010 Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) were revised last year and, the English translation of the 2019 SOD has now been released. The cluster approach is embedded into the disaster management protocols in line with international best practices. A handbookon humanitarian coordination and collaboration in Bangladesh for climate-related disasters was published by the Office of the Resident Coordinator in collaboration with UKAid to mark the International Disaster Reduction Day. The handbook is a tool for any organization willing to support Bangladesh’s authorities and communities to prepare for, to respond to and to bounce back from shocks. The International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction was started in 1989, after a call by the United Nations General Assembly for a day to promote a global culture of risk-awareness and disaster reduction. Held every 13 October, the day celebrates how people and communities around the world are reducing their exposure to disasters and raising awareness about the importance of reining in the risks that they face.
MOGADISHU, 21 September 2020— The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are urging parents and caregivers in south and central parts of Somalia to ensure all children aged under five are vaccinated against polio during a special house-to-house immunization campaign, which began yesterday and runs until 23 September. Both agencies are advising health workers and caregivers to observe health and safety measures against COVID-19 during the four-day campaign. This advice comes in the wake of efforts to curb the spread of the ongoing polio outbreak in the south and central parts of Somalia. The strain of polio that is in circulation is different from the wild poliovirus, recently declared as eradicated from Africa, but it can also put communities where not enough children have been vaccinated at risk and leave children paralyzed for life. The outbreak has paralyzed 19 children since late 2017. “The only way to stop such outbreaks from vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio, is to vaccinate every child every time immunization services are offered, either through routine programmes or through such mass campaigns. We all have a moral responsibility to reach and boost the immunity of every last child in Somalia. Owing to access, security and health-seeking behaviour, we are missing a large number of children every year, who are not receiving these life-saving vaccines,” said Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik, WHO Representative for Somalia. During the ongoing campaign, 6 266 vaccinators in urban areas and 2 685 vaccinators in rural areas will be going from door to door to vaccinate 1.65 million children aged under five with oral polio vaccine. In efforts to reach every child possible, an additional 1 125 team supervisors will be visiting households in targeted areas. 3 390 community mobilizers, sensitizing target communities, will play a key role in helping families to understand, trust and accept vaccines. “It is critical that all routine immunizations continue, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Werner Schultink, UNICEF Representative for Somalia. “These vaccination drives will help prevent further outbreaks and will protect children from deadly diseases so they can survive and thrive.” Before the campaign, polio health workers were trained and supplied with personal protective equipment, including face masks, soap and hand sanitizer, to keep them and communities safe from COVID-19. This campaign is the first step in a two-part effort to raise immunity levels among Somali children. Somalia’s Government, WHO and UNICEF will conduct the second part of the campaign in October to continue to strengthen the immunity of Somali children. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to accept the vaccine when it is offered to give their children life-long protection against polio. This polio campaign is supported by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), an organization dedicated to the eradication of polio. Launched in 1988, the GPEI is spearheaded by national governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF, and supported by key partners including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.
The conference titled “Second Regional Thematic Conference on Reintegration, Return and Labour Migration in the Context of Covid-19 pandemic” is the second in a series of three regional conferences to be held on topics of regional interest within the migration field. This high level event triggered exchanges on the experiences and lessons learned of governments within the region in responding to the socio-economic impacts and opportunities of return migration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three main thematic areas were investigated: (i) Social and Economic Reintegration into Slowing Economies and Labour Markets; (ii) Leveraging the Return of Skilled Migrants for Economic Development and; (iii) Re-Opening Safe, Regular Labour Migration Channels. The event took place online and was organized within the framework of the project “Enhancing Migrants’ Rights and Good Governance in Armenia and Georgia (EMERGE)” funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway. The conference opened with an address by Ilona Ter-Minasyan, Head of Office, IOM Armenia, who outlined the potential of returning migrants to support the better recovery for countries participating in this conference post-COVID-19 pandemic. “This is part of our efforts to initiate and maintain and energize the migration management-related dialogue amongst the countries in the region…This year we are moving to another set of issues and challenges which are shared across the region and which are particular relevant in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are soon to enter year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has completely changed our environment in which we operate and has put additional challenges both to migrants and migration and to entities and stakeholders in managing migration,” she noted.  The conference facilitated rich discussions across the three thematic areas with contributions from high-ranking officials, migration experts, and representatives from civil society and the private sector. The panelists shared innovative approaches and strategies employed by their respective countries, underscoring the need for regional cooperation and exchange of best practices.  Key outcomes included the identification of priority actions to foster effective socio-economic reintegration, mechanisms to harness the potential of skilled returnees, and frameworks to ensure the safe and regular migration of labor. Participants highlighted the critical role of international collaboration in addressing the complex dynamics of migration amidst a global health crisis.  The event underscored the commitment of all involved entities to continue the dialogue, implement actionable solutions, and support migrants’ rights and reintegration efforts in the post-pandemic era.
As elsewhere in the world, women in Ukraine represent a large proportion of the agricultural labour force and the majority of food producers, and thus play key roles in managing natural resources and promoting the well-being of their families. To explore and analyse gender issues in agriculture and food security, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed the first Country Gender Assessment for Ukraine,. The report – part of FAO’s Country Gender Assessment series, and whose full title is ‘National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine)’ – aims to serve policymakers and practitioners engaged in the formulation and implementation of agriculture policies and programmes, researchers and analysts, civil society actors, and other partners. The report acknowledges women’s role in food systems and rural development, yet it also points out their unequal access to land and other assets and resources, which limits their economic opportunities and puts them at risk of being left behind. Based on these findings, the report provides recommendations on how to address gender inequalities for increased agricultural productivity and food security, and sustainable rural development. Greater agricultural productivity, food security and rural livelihoods, says the report, cannot be achieved without recognising the distinct and complementary roles of women and men, and ensuring social and economic equality for both groups. “The report contributes to the existing knowledge base about gender equality in the country, by bringing together gender statistics and experts’ opinions, but also serving as an advocacy tool to provide greater visibility to rural women’s contribution to agricultural productivity and food security,” said Mara Lopes, FAO Ukraine Head of Office. “Women and girls are critical agents in the fight against rural poverty and food insecurity. Supporting them in reaching their full potential will enable agricultural and rural development processes to be more effective.” “The FAO report on Gender, Agriculture and Rural Development is an in-depth and comprehensive document covering gender issues in the context of different areas of women's and men's lives, including participation in decision-making, freedom from violence, the impact of climate change, access to resources such as land, water energy, education, health and more,” added Kateryna Levchenko, Government Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy. “This makes it a relevant source of information for all a wide range of users”. However, the report finds that rural women in Ukraine are limited in their capacity to contribute to agricultural production and take advantage of new opportunities, being concentrated in informal jobs and overloaded by multiple responsibilities. These include unpaid informal work on family farms, daily housework, and caring for children and other family members. Despite the heavy workload, their effort is often invisible and receives little recognition or economic or social reward. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many women across the region find themselves in an even more disadvantaged situation, as evidence points to increased rates of domestic violence and longer hours of care work due to the widespread closure of schools,” said Dono Abdurazakova, FAO Senior Gender and Social Protection Advisor. “Rural women with disabilities, women from ethnic minority groups such as Roma women, women who have been internally displaced, and many more, suffer from multiple vulnerabilities.” One in every six people employed in Ukraine works in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The report reveals that specific job types within that sector tend to fall into either “female” or “male” occupation categories. Men represent 71 percent of all formal employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, whereas women in the same sector tend to work informally. Women make up 56 percent of migrant labour in Ukraine to provide a comprehensive understanding of gender dynamics in the agriculture sector in Ukraine.  The FAO report underscores the critical need for gender-sensitive policies to bridge the gaps women face in accessing education, technology, and capital. It stresses the importance of creating legal frameworks that ensure women's equal rights to land ownership and inheritance, as well as the need for targeted training programs that enhance women's skills and knowledge in agricultural practices and business management. Enhancing women's participation in decision-making processes at all levels—from local to national—is also highlighted as essential for fostering inclusive rural development.  Furthermore, the report calls for better rural infrastructure and services that can alleviate the burden of unpaid care work on women. Improved access to childcare services, healthcare, and transport can play a significant role in enabling rural women to engage more actively in productive economic activities. The creation of social protection programs tailored to the needs of rural women can also provide them with the security needed to invest in their agricultural enterprises.  At the community level, challenging and changing social norms that perpetuate gender inequality is vital. The FAO recommends community-based interventions that promote gender equality and empower women, including campaigns that raise awareness about women's rights and the vital contributions they make to agricultural productivity and rural development.  The findings and recommendations of the National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine) are intended to inform and guide stakeholders in the agricultural sector, including governmental bodies, international organizations, and NGOs, in creating more equitable and sustainable agricultural systems.  The FAO's commitment to gender equality is reflected in its efforts to integrate a gender perspective in all its programs and policies. By addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by women in agriculture, Ukraine can make significant strides towards achieving food security, reducing rural poverty, and promoting sustainable rural development for all.  This report serves as a timely and necessary tool for advancing gender equality in Ukraine's agricultural sector, ensuring that women and men can contribute equally to, and benefit from, the country’s development.

As expected, the work of this group will support the national efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Turkmenistan”, noted Ms. Natia Natsvlishvili, UN Resident Coordinator a.i. and UNDP Resident Representative a.i. in Turkmenistan. Implementation of the Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF) will contribute to the development of such strategic priorities of Turkmenistan as the development of the financial planning and budgeting, improvement of the investment climate and business environment, development of capital markets and the introduction of innovative financial instruments.
**Press Release: New Legislative Mechanism to Support Agricultural Advisory Services in Azerbaijan**  In a move to enhance agricultural advisory services in Azerbaijan, a new legislative mechanism is being developed. This initiative aligns with a comprehensive five-year strategy aiming to support local farmers and improve agricultural productivity. Drawing inspiration from European best practices, the strategy has been crafted through inclusive discussions involving key stakeholders.  As part of the strategy's implementation, pilot programs will be launched in two regions, serving as models for future nationwide rollout. These pilot programs aim to test and refine the advisory services, ensuring they effectively meet the needs of Azerbaijan's agricultural sector.  This development marks a significant step towards bolstering the nation's agriculture, fostering growth, and integrating European standards into local practices. Further updates on the progress of the legislative mechanism and pilot programs will be provided as the project advances.
Information and communication technologies have been invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic. They help us to stay connected, and to keep vital services and businesses going. Yet almost half the world is still offline – and most of those who lack access to digital technology are women and girls in developing countries. Latest figures from the International Telecommunication Union show a 17 per cent gender gap in internet use globally. This is even wider in least developed countries. In some regions, this gender gap is growing, reinforcing gender inequalities by denying women and girls opportunities to access education, find better-paid jobs, and start new businesses. Making these technologies available to all is an essential part of building a more inclusive and equitable digital future. To address this issue, governments, the private sector, and international organizations must work together to invest in digital infrastructure, promote digital literacy, and create policies that ensure equal access to technology for women and girls. Bridging the digital divide is crucial for empowering all individuals and fostering sustainable development worldwide.
“Preserving our environment guide UN’s COVID response and recovery programmes” “Preserving our environment guide UN’s COVID response and recovery programmes” The United Nations chose 5 June to be the World Environment Day to stress the importance of our environment, nature and planet for all people globally. It is an opportunity to raise awareness of decision makers and communities about environmental challenges and related threats that goes beyond nations and generations. This year, we are witnessing one of the most severe global crises that is affecting everyone around the world. COVID-19 is not just a pandemic that hit the health sector, but it has also profoundly impacted economies, livelihoods, and social structures. The pandemic has highlighted the interconnectedness of human and planetary health, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to recovery that incorporates environmental sustainability.  In response, the United Nations has integrated environmental preservation into its COVID-19 response and recovery programs. These initiatives aim to foster green recovery efforts that prioritize the protection of ecosystems, the promotion of renewable energy, and the creation of green jobs. By investing in sustainable practices, countries can build resilience against future crises, be they health-related or environmental.  The UN recognizes that a healthy environment is foundational to the well-being of humanity. Pollution, loss of biodiversity, and climate change are underlying drivers of health risks and vulnerabilities. Therefore, as we rebuild from the devastation caused by COVID-19, it is critical that our strategies are sustainable and environmentally sound.  World Environment Day serves as a reminder that the health of our planet is crucial for the survival of future generations. As we advance in our recovery efforts, let us seize this moment to advocate for and implement policies that nurture our environment, ensuring a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient world for all.  The collaboration of governments, industries, and communities in this endeavor is essential. Together, we can turn the tide and emerge from this crisis stronger and more united in our commitment to preserving our planet.
We call for speech that shows full respect for the humanity and dignity of the other. “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” Although seemingly simple and straightforward, article 1 of the Universal Human Rights Declaration remains a far cry for many. Discrimination but also other violations of fundamental human rights remain a reality for too many people around the world today. Respect for the human rights of all is fundamental for sustainable peace and inclusive development. This was so the case in 1948, when the Universal Declaration was adopted, and it remains so today. In his Call to Action for Human Rights last year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that human rights are essential to addressing the causes and impact of today's complex crises, and to building sustainable, safe, and peaceful societies. In tackling the challenges we face, everyone’s opinion and criticism count. Everyone deserves space to express views freely and without fear, though – as international human rights law states – with respect for the special duties and responsibilities this freedom carries, one of which is respect for the rights of others. Here we have noted a challenge, one that is not unique to Montenegro: hate speech. We have observed hate speech based on ethnicity, national identity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliation. It denigrates, dehumanizes, discriminates and excludes. It has led to a few hate crimes. Hate speech can threaten peaceful societies as the Special Adviser on the Prevention Genocide, who leads the UN in tackling the phenomenon and who visited Montenegro in November, often warns about. On the occasion of International Human Rights Day, the UN Country Team in Montenegro calls for more rather than less speech to counter the challenge that hate speech presents to our societies. We call for speech that shows full respect for the humanity and dignity of the other. And we ask leaders, may they be political, religious or otherwise, but also those who have influence, like traditional and the online media, to serve as examples. Let us all use this essential freedom for what it is meant – to create free, open, respectful societies in which everyone has an opportunity to take part, makes their voice heard and to ultimately contribute to a better life for all.
